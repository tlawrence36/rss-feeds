      "Hitmaking record producer Richard Perry has died at 82",
      "Richard Perry, a hitmaking record producer with a flair for both standards and contemporary sounds whose many successes included Carly Simon\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d Rod Stewart\u2019s \u201cThe Great American Songbook\u201d series and a Ringo Starr album featuring all four Beatles, died Tuesday. He was 82.",
      "Perry, a recipient of a Grammys Trustee Award in 2015, died at a Los Angeles hospital after suffering cardiac arrest, friend Daphna Kastner said.",
      "\u201cHe maximized his time here,\u201d said Kastner, who called him a \u201cfather friend\u201d and said he was godfather to her son. \u201cHe was generous, fun, sweet and made the world a better place. The world is a little less sweeter without him here. But it's a little bit sweeter in heaven.\u201d",
      "Perry was a onetime drummer, oboist and doo-wop singer who proved at home with a wide variety of musical styles, the rare producer to have No. 1 hits on the pop, R&B, dance and country charts. He was on hand for Harry Nilsson\u2019s \u201cWithout You\u201d and The Pointer Sisters' \u201cI\u2019m So Excited,\u201d Tiny Tim\u2019s novelty smash \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d and the Willie Nelson-Julio Iglesias lounge standard \u201cTo All the Girls I\u2019ve Loved Before.\u201d Perry was widely known as a \u201cmusician\u2019s producer,\u201d treating artists like peers rather than vehicles for his own tastes. Singers turned to him whether trying to update their sound (Barbra Streisand), set back the clock (Stewart), revive their career (Fats Domino) or fulfill early promise (Leo Sayer).",
      "\u201cRichard had a knack for matching the right song to the right artist,\u201d Streisand wrote in her 2023 memoir, \u201cMy Name is Barbra.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s life was a story, in part, of famous friends and the right places. He was backstage for 1950s performances by Little Richard and Chuck Berry, sat in the third row at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival during Otis Redding\u2019s memorable set and attended a recording session for the Rolling Stones\u2019 classic \u201cLet It Bleed\u201d album. A given week might find him dining one night with Paul and Linda McCartney, and Mick and Bianca Jagger the next. He dated Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Fonda among others and was briefly married to the actor Rebecca Broussard.",
      "In Stewart's autobiography, \u201cRod,\u201d he would remember Perry's home in West Hollywood as \u201cthe scene of much late-night skulduggery through the 1970s and beyond, and a place you knew you could always fall into at the end of an evening for a full-blown knees-up with drink and music and dancing.\u201d",
      "In the '70s, Perry helped facilitate a near-Beatles reunion.",
      "He had produced a track on Starr\u2019s first solo album, \u201cSentimental Journey,\u201d and grown closer to him through Nilsson and other mutual friends. \u201cRingo,\u201d released in 1973, would prove the drummer was a commercial force in his own right \u2014 with some well-placed names stopping by. The album, featuring contributions from Nilsson, Billy Preston, Steve Cropper, Martha Reeves and all five members of The Band, reached No. 2 on Billboard and sold more than 1 million copies. Hit singles included the chart toppers \u201cPhotograph,\u201d co-written by Starr and George Harrison, and a remake of the 1950s favorite \u201cYou\u2019re Sixteen.\u201d",
      "But for Perry and others, the most memorable track was a non-hit, custom made. John Lennon\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest\u201d was a mock-anthem for the self-effacing drummer that brought three Beatles into the studio just three years after the band\u2019s breakup. Starr was on drums and sang lead, Lennon was on keyboards and backing vocals and longtime Beatles friend Klaus Voormann played bass. They were still working on the song when Harrison\u2019s assistant phoned, asking if the guitarist could join them. Harrison arrived soon after.",
      "\u201cAs I looked around the room, I realized that I was at the very epicenter of the spiritual and musical quest I had dreamed of for so many years,\u201d Perry wrote in his 2021 memoir, \u201cCloud Nine.\u201d \u201cBy the end of each session, a small group of friends had gathered, standing silently along the back wall, just thrilled to be there.\u201d",
      "McCartney was not in town for \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest,\u201d but he did help write and arrange the ballad \u201cSix O\u2019Clock,\u201d featuring the ex-Beatle and Linda McCartney on backing vocals.",
      "Perry had helped make pop history the year before as producer of \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d which he would call the nearest he came to a perfect record. Simon\u2019s scathing ballad about an unnamed lover, with Voormann\u2019s bass runs kicking off the song and Jagger joining on the chorus, hit No. 1 in 1972 and began a long-term debate over Simon\u2019s intended target. Perry\u2019s answer would echo Simon\u2019s own belated response.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take this opportunity to give my insider\u2019s scoop,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cThe person that the song is based on is really a composite of several men that Carly dated in the \u201960s and early \u201970s, but primarily, it\u2019s about my good friend, Warren Beatty.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s post-1970s work included such hit singles as The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cNeutron Dance\u201d and DeBarge\u2019s \u201cRhythm of the Night,\u201d along with albums by Simon, Ray Charles and Art Garfunkel. He had his greatest success with Stewart\u2019s million-selling \u201cThe Great American Songbook\u201d albums, a project made possible by the rock star\u2019s writer\u2019s block and troubled private life. In the early 2000s, Stewart\u2019s marriage to Rachel Hunter had ended and Perry was among those consoling him. With Stewart struggling to come up with original songs, he and Perry agreed that an album of standards might work, including \u201cThe Very Thought of You,\u201d \u201cAngel Eyes\u201d and \u201cWhere or When.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were at a back table in our favorite restaurant as we exchanged ideas and wrote them down on a napkin,\u201d Perry wrote in his memoir. Stewart softly sang the options. \u201cAs I sat there and listened to him sing, it was clear that we both sensed we were on to something,\u201d Perry added.",
      "Perry was a New York City native born into a musical family; his parents, Mark and Sylvia Perry, co-founded Peripole Music, a pioneering manufacturer of instruments for young people. With his family\u2019s help and encouragement, he learned to play drums and oboe and helped form a doo-wop group, the Escorts, that released a handful of singles. A music and theater major at the University of Michigan, he initially dreamed of acting on Broadway. Instead, he made the \u201clife-changing\u201d decision in the mid-1960s to form a production company with a recent acquaintance, Gary Katz, who would go on to work with Steely Dan among others.",
      "By the end of the decade, Perry was an industry star, working on Captain Beefheart\u2019s acclaimed cult album, \u201cSafe As Milk\u201d and the debut recording of Tiny Tim and Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cElla,\u201d featuring the jazz great's interpretations of songs by the Beatles, Smokey Robinson and Randy Newman. In the early 1970s, he would oversee Streisand\u2019s million-selling \u201cStoney End\u201d album, on which the singer turned from the show tunes that made her famous and covered a range of pop and rock music, from the title track, a Laura Nyro composition, to Gordon Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cIf You Could Read My Mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked Richard from the moment we met. He was tall and lanky, with a mop of dark, curly hair and a big smile, which his big heart,\u201d Streisand wrote in her memoir. \u201cAt our first meeting, he arrived laden with songs, and we listened to them together. Whatever hesitation I may have felt about our collaboration soon vanished and I thought, \u2018This could be fun, and musically liberating.\u2019\u201d",

      "The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer may clear the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer clears the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath, attorneys for plaintiffs in the civil suit said Tuesday.",
      "At a news conference in Los Angeles, victims\u2019 rights attorney Gloria Allred said that the parents and younger sister of deceased cinematographer Halyna Hutchins were disappointed that prosecutors won't appeal the dismissal of an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin. The criminal charge against Baldwin was dismissed halfway through trial in July on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during a rehearsal in the movie \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Baldwin, the lead actor and coproducer, was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when it discharged, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the revolver fired.",
      "Allred said Hutchins' relatives are determined to pursue damages and compensation from Baldwin and \u201cRust\u201d producers in New Mexico civil court, and want Baldwin to answer questions under oath in the proceedings. Hutchins' widower and son previously reached a separate legal settlement.",
      "\u201cWith the withdrawal that was made public yesterday, we are now able to proceed with our civil case,\u201d Allred said. \u201cClearly, the rights of Alec Baldwin were protected, but the due process rights of the victims \u2014 Halyna Hutchins and her parents and her sister \u2014 were violated.\u201d",
      "Allred said she's ready to prove that Hutchins had a close relationship with her parents and sister \u2014 a prerequisite for seeking civil damages.",
      "In November court filings in the civil lawsuit, Baldwin denied allegations that he was negligent or at fault in the shooting of Hutchins and sought to suspend the case. Attorneys for Baldwin could not immediately be reached Tuesday.",
      "Allred read a statement from Hutchins' sister, Svetlana Zemko, that said, \u201cMr. Baldwin must be held accountable.\u201d",
      "In April, a judge sentenced movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed to the maximum of 1 1/2 years at a state penitentiary on an involuntary manslaughter conviction in Hutchins\u2019 death.",
      "Allred condemned New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez for declining to appeal the dismissal of the criminal charge against Baldwin, calling him \u201cthe Grinch who stole Christmas\" at the Christmas Eve news conference.",
      "Torrez spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez defended the decision in an email, citing \u201csignificant procedural irregularities\u201d identified by the judge in the criminal case.",
      "\"Attorney General Torrez will not prolong the grief and anguish of Ms. Hutchins' family in the vain attempt to salvage the compromised criminal case against Mr. Baldwin,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThere are other victims\u2019 families in Santa Fe County and across New Mexico who are awaiting justice, and our energy needs to be devoted to supporting those cases on appeal.\u201d",

    "summary": "Angel Blue, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera&rsquo;s first new production of Verdi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aida&rdquo; in 36 years",
    "story": [
      "Angel Blue, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years",
      "If she has the voice of an angel, and the face of an angel, she must be an Angel.",
      "Angel Blue, that is.",
      "The American soprano, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years. Blue, now 40, debuted at the Met in 2017 as Mimi in Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boheme\u201d and has become a fixture at the house, starring in two opening nights and this fall portraying the lead character in Osvaldo Golijov\u2019s \u201cAinadamar.\u201d",
      "But \u201cAida\u201d is something else. The title role of the enslaved Ethiopian princess torn between love for an Egyptian warrior and loyalty to her country represents the pinnacle of Verdi\u2019s mature vocal style. It demands power, flexibility and the ability to spin out long phrases, while conveying the dramatic intensity of the character\u2019s emotional turmoil.",
      "It also comes weighted with history, especially for a Black soprano at the Met, where Leontyne Price embodied the role from her first performance in 1961 until her retirement in 1985.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the next Leontyne Price, but I\u2019ve definitely looked at her my whole life as an example of someone to model myself after,\u201d Blue said in an interview after a day of rehearsal.",
      "\u201cSometimes in opera there\u2019s an intimidation factor because of those who come before us,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it\u2019s somebody who I look up to, I feel like, OK it\u2019s my turn. Thank you so much, it\u2019s because of you I\u2019m here.\u201d",
      "Blue\u2019s turn comes on New Year\u2019s Eve, when Michael Mayer\u2019s production opens before a sold-out house with a cast that includes tenor Piotr Beczala as her lover, Radames, mezzo Judit Kutasi as her rival, Amneris, and baritone Quinn Kelsey as her father, Amonasro. Met music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducts. The Jan. 25 matinee will be broadcast live in HD to movie theaters worldwide.",
      "Blue was less than a year old when Price made her Met farewell, so she never got to hear her live in opera. But her father, a classically trained gospel singer and pastor, loved her recordings and \u2014 according to family lore \u2014 pronounced shortly after Blue was born that she would be \u201cthe next Leontyne Price.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy beautiful dad, he was just enamored of her,\u201d Blue said. \u201cIt was like a thought that came into his heart when I took my first breath.\u201d",
      "Growing up as one of five children in Southern California, Blue sang in church, studied voice and piano in high school, then entered several beauty pageants and used her prize money to help pay for her musical studies. She had been bitten by the opera bug at age 4 when her father took her to see a concert performance of Puccini\u2019s \u201cTurandot\u201d while the family was visiting relatives in Cleveland.",
      "Though she had sung \u201cAida\u201d once in concert in Detroit, her only previous staged performances came last year at London\u2019s Royal Opera House. The critics were impressed, though some felt she was still mastering the role.",
      "\u201cSometimes Blue\u2019s tone frays under pressure,\u201d wrote Neil Fisher in The Times. But he added that she is \u201ca heartfelt, affecting Aida \u2026 riding high in ensembles. This gutsy Aida will grow in authority.\u201d",
      "Mark Elder, who conducted Blue in London, recalled that \u201cwhen she came to me, she wasn\u2019t very experienced in the part, and I was incredibly impressed with how she would quietly go on with studying it and thinking about it and taking on board some of the ideas that I gave her.",
      "\u201cTo express everything the music demands of her is by far the hardest thing that she\u2019s probably ever had to do,\u201d Elder said. \u201cBy the time she did the first performance with me it was clear she was very suited to the role. She will sing it for years to come.\u201d",
      "Mayer said that during the Met rehearsals he was struck by how naturally Blue was able to capture the character\u2019s inner conflicts as she is torn between love for her Egyptian captor and duty to her homeland and her father.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about working with Angel is that she is utterly sympathetic,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cShe does the thing that great actors do: She has the thought, and we see it. She\u2019s not doing any histrionic indicating of feelings, she\u2019s trusting that Verdi knew what he was doing in terms of how the music is telling its own story.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a gentle soul, but then she opens up and you hear this magnificent voice,\u201d Mayer said.",
      "Opening night of the Met production will be a poignant occasion for Blue because New Year\u2019s Eve marks the 18th anniversary of her father\u2019s death. Her mother and brother will be in the audience cheering her on, and the rest of her family will come to a later performance. She\u2019s determined not to disappoint them.",
      "\u201cI feel like a boxer at the side of the ring, and I have these gloves on that say \u2018AIDA,\u2019\u201d Blue said. \u201cPeople are giving me water, patting me down and saying, \u2018Angel, you\u2019ve got this. You can do it!\u2019\u2019\u201d"

      "Of all the movie protagonists you might have seen this year, none is quite like Marianne Jean-Baptiste\u2019s Pansy in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths.\u201d",
      "Pansy, a middle-aged woman in contemporary London, is foul-tempered from beginning to end. She spends her days in evident pain that she unleashes upon all those around her, including her husband Curtley (David Webber), her 20-something son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) and most anyone else she encounters. Her venom might fall on a supermarket cashier or a furniture-shopping couple who dare to put their feet up on an ottoman. Heaven help the man who wants her parking spot.",
      "For everyone, Pansy is a test. She tests the patience and empathy of her family, just as she does the viewer. She\u2019s not an antihero, she\u2019s anti-everything.",
      "\u201cThe world is full of Pansys. People live with other people\u2019s conditions,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cOften I\u2019ve met people who have just been enraged, because you didn\u2019t see them in the car park pulling into the space. You go: It can\u2019t just be about me. How did you get that angry about something so stupid? You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through or how they got there.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard Truths,\u201d which will open nationwide in theaters Jan. 10, never supplies any answers. Instead, it unfolds as a cantankerous character study, led by Jean-Baptiste\u2019s compellingly prickly Pansy.",
      "The performance has earned Jean-Baptiste her best reviews since her last film with Leigh: \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d nearly 30 years ago. For that film, Jean-Baptiste became the first Black British actress nominated for an Academy Award. Her performance in \u201cHard Truths\u201d has been just as celebrated, earning best actress from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Three decades later, Jean-Baptiste could be heading back to the Oscars.",
      "\u201cYou sit down with Marianne a hundred years later from \u2018Secrets and Lies,\u2019 in which she played a very intelligent young woman, and Marianne has now moved on in life,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cWe love each other because she\u2019s very, very funny. So sitting down with her ability to be real and profound but also grotesque, that, alone, points me in the direction of possibility.\u201d",
      "Making a film with Leigh, the 81-year-old humanist master of \u201cNaked,\u201d \u201cVera Drake\u201d and \u201cMr. Turner,\u201d isn\u2019t a typical process. There\u2019s no script to begin with, just an invitation.",
      "\u201cIt was the usual: Let\u2019s do a film,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cDon\u2019t know anything, but let\u2019s do it.\u201d",
      "Leigh pulls his characters and storyline out of months of rehearsal. In the case of \u201cHard Truths,\u201d they rehearsed for three months \u2014 somewhat short for Leigh (it was six months for \u201cSecrets & Lies\u201d), but extremely lengthy for today\u2019s movie industry.",
      "\u201cNormally you get on set it\u2019s like, \u2018Uh, this is Ralph. He\u2019ll be playing your husband. You\u2019ll stand over there,\u2019\u201d says Jean-Baptiste.",
      "In Leigh\u2019s manner of rehearsal, they begin with a character\u2019s first memory, and then flesh out their life all the way up until the time period of the film. But there are parallel histories for other characters that require constantly going back through and recontextualizing. Meanwhile, costume designers and production designers await clarity on what kind of clothes and homes they should craft.",
      "\u201cAll the decisions about the character that you can make, the actor makes them,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cAny of the decisions that God makes for somebody\u2019s life, he makes them. So it\u2019s like: She wants this job, so she applies. A letter arrives in the mail: Unfortunately you did not get it.\u201d",
      "Jean-Baptiste was a recent drama school graduate, classically trained and oriented toward theater, when she co-starred in 1996\u2019s \u201cSecrets & Lies.\u201d It was her breakthrough. A few years after that film, she moved to Los Angeles, where she\u2019s been since, acting in a wide variety of projects including the TV series \u201cWithout a Trace,\u201d \u201cBlindspot\u201d and \u201cHomecoming.\u201d Asked if her collaboration with Leigh had changed from \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d Jean-Baptiste said much was the same.",
      "\u201cObviously we\u2019re a lot older,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI think we just slipped right back into it. He was gentler.\u201d",
      "Part of what makes Jean-Baptiste\u2019s performance as Pansy so uncanny is how unlike Pansy she is. Jean-Baptiste is charismatic, laughs frequently and enjoys throwing herself into uncertain circumstances (like \u201cHard Truths\u201d). Asked if she has anything in common with Pansy, she replies, with a laugh, \u201cI hope not.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a sense of humor she doesn\u2019t, although she\u2019s really funny,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI think I recognize that part of myself to the extent that I\u2019m like: That\u2019s not how I want to live. That\u2019s not how I want to be.\u201d",
      "But in Pansy, Jean-Baptiste recognized people she knows, and the kind of character that seldom makes it onto movie screens. \u201cA difficult Black woman, you don\u2019t see that,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever have.\u201d",
      "In \u201cHard Truths,\u201d the root of Pansy's depression is uncertain, but a sense of festering wounds from the past is palpable. When she speaks to a doctor, she sums it up: \u201cThe heart of the matter is me head.\u201d Later, when asked why she can\u2019t enjoy life, she replies, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jean-Baptiste, in mapping out Pansy\u2019s history, has some theories about what\u2019s made her this way.",
      "\u201cShe had a number of issues that went unaddressed and found coping mechanisms to get through life,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cI think a lot of people are undiagnosed with things and just make do. Maybe she\u2019s one of those.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fear,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt was the fear that I focused on the most. She attacks before anyone can attack her, and she thinks everyone is attacking her.\u201d",
      "But Pansy\u2019s specific diagnosis isn\u2019t the point of \u201cHard Truths.\u201d It's much more about how her family and the outside world react to her. She might be pushing everyone away, but it's clear she's in urgent need of something.",
      "\u201cI want so desperately for someone to help Pansy,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI think it would be very convenient to go, \u2018She\u2019s got this mental illness or that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with her.\u2019 But what\u2019s more interesting is that we don\u2019t actually know and she\u2019s just in pain.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d ultimately ends in a kind of cliffhanger, with Pansy and her family locked in stasis. If Pansy tests the boundaries of empathy an audience might feel for a character, it's a moment of truth: Does Pansy go to her husband or refuse to budge? Jean-Baptiste wants to believe in her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to think that she goes, I do, because I like her,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI like Pansy. I gotta look out for her.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 John Mulaney's second trip to Broadway took little convincing. He didn't even need to look at the script before signing on.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, well, send it to me. I\u2019ll read it.\u2019 And they sent it to me. I didn\u2019t read it. I just agreed immediately,\u201d the actor-comedian says.",
      "What Mulaney signed up for was \u201cAll In: Comedy About Love,\u201d a stage adaptation of his friend Simon Rich's short stories that's charming Broadway audiences this winter with a starry cast.",
      "Joining Mulaney \u2014 who made his Broadway debut in 2016 with \u201cOh, Hello\u201d \u2014 is Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry, Richard Kind and Fred Armisen. They'll eventually be replaced by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jimmy Fallon, Aidy Bryant, Nick Kroll, Tim Meadows, Chloe Fineman, Andrew Rannells, David Cross, Annaleigh Ashford and Hank Azaria.",
      "\u201cAll In\u201d opens with the surreal story of a guy who walks into a bar that has a 12-inch piano player and then goes on to feature personal ads from dogs \u2014 \u201cFull disclosure: I'm neutered but no complaints yet,\u201d reads one \u2014 a love triangle involving The Elephant Man, an aging talent agent confronting Death and a history report from the 2070s.",
      "\u201cThese are such meticulously, beautifully written pieces,\u201d says Mulaney, who befriended Rich when both worked at \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d \u201cBecause they so naturally lend themselves to performing, it\u2019s very fun to take it off the page.\u201d",
      "Director Alex Timbers first approached Rich, the son of noted critic Frank Rich, with the idea of transferring some of his short stories to the stage.",
      "\u201cOur first reading was 4 1/2 hours long so it took some process of elimination, but we eventually found a batch of stories that we felt were not just thematically linked, but would lend themselves to powerful performances by talented actors,\u201d says Rich.",
      "Once they found the right stories, attention went to presenting them: How many actors should there be? How much of a production should the 90-minute play be? Should there be costumes and sets?",
      "They landed on minimalism and four actors, which offered both a chance to showcase each's versatility and make the play more intimate. The show is enlivened by original illustrations from New Yorker cartoonist Emily Flake and the band The Bengsons playing love songs from The Magnetic Fields' catalog.",
      "\u201cWhat was going to serve the material best was the purest communication of it to the audience,\u201d says Mulaney. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to use a drug thing, but mainlining the material versus taking it in a dissolvable.\u201d",
      "Two of the stories \u2014 a pair of passive-aggressive pirates who abandon their rough ways to raise a young stowaway and a noir detective tale told by babies \u2014 features children and child-rearing, something both Rich and Mulaney can now relate to.",
      "\u201cIt all is greatly enhanced by my own life,\u201d says Mulaney, the \u201ctouring, stand-up comedian, \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019-writing, complete night owl, Dracula-like creature who now has two kids and lives in the California suburbs.\u201d",
      "The original four cast members will give way to four more but Rich and Mulaney think the structure is sound and can take changes. It helps that each performer sits in chairs for the entire show and has a script in their lap should they need it.",
      "\u201cSo many people can find a way into these stories that I am sure anyone coming in to do any of these pieces will be able to bring themselves to it and rise to the occasion of how good the writing is,\u201d says Mulaney.",
      "The replacements won't slip into the exact performer's spot just vacated \u2014 Rich says they'll scramble the parts up. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me to imagine how not just new individual performances will change things, but new pairings as well,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many of the stories live in the scene work between two cast members and that\u2019s another thrilling thing for me to imagine is those shifting dynamics.\u201d",
      "The audience at the Hudson Theatre during one recent performance was notably younger than for most Broadway shows and Mulaney and Rich hope they can do some theatrical recruitment with \u201cAll In.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we are finding that there are some first-time theatergoers or new theater goers that are coming and we\u2019re thrilled by that,\u201d says Rich. \u201cWe hope that comedy fans will enjoy this experience and that it\u2019ll help convert them into theater fans and maybe they\u2019ll see this show and want to check out more.\u201d"

      "\u201cIncluding promotion, I'd been living with Gi-hun for about two years,\" said Lee in a recent interview. \u201cI really felt like I was him,\" he said in a recent interview.",
      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d follows an underground competition in Korea that recruits people in debt to participate in childlike games for money. Once the games begin, the contestants realize there are deadly consequences.",
      "The show was a global hit when it was released in 2021, becoming Netflix's most-watched series. It also won numerous accolades including Primetime Emmy Awards for acting for Lee Jung-jae and directing for Hwang Dong-hyuk. Lee's career catapulted, taking him to the Cannes Film Festival and giving him his first English-language role in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d series \u201cThe Acolyte\u201d for Disney+.",
      "Lee says when Netflix ordered a second season of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d he questioned the timeline because it took Hwang years to work on the first one. \"I wondered, \u2018How many years will it take him to write season two,\u2019\" said Lee. Hwang, in turn, surprised everyone \u2014 including himself \u2014 by taking just six months to write season two and a third and final season. \u201cI'm not sure I'll ever be able to write something that fast again,\u201d he said.",
      "Creating new characters and their individual stories came easily. The biggest, challenge, Hwang said, was deciding what should happen with Gi-hun. Lee says when he read the scripts he thought Hwang \u201creally is a genius.\u201d",
      "It's rare for even successful TV shows in Korea to have more than one season so it was a big swing, even for the new cast.",

Season two has already been nominated in the best drama series category at the upcoming Golden Globe Awards.",
      "The opportunity to work on a project with worldwide appeal is a dream come true for a performer.

Joe: The Rise of the Cobra\u201d with Channing Tatum and Dennis Quaid and \u201cRed 2\u201d with Bruce Willis. It's \u201cSquid Game\u201d that he credits for taking his career to another level.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been an actor for over three decades and ... maybe most people outside of Korea have never seen anything that I\u2019ve been in. If anyone through \u2018Squid Game\u2019 wishes to see more of me or becomes more curious about my previous works, as an actor, nothing would be more rewarding or bring me greater joy.\"",
      "The audition process moved slowly. Jo Yu-ri recalls waiting two months between the first and second-round. When she finally got the part Jo says, \u201cI actually remember crying.\u201d The actors were asked to not speak publicly about their casting to wait for Netflix to make an announcement. \u201cThere were a couple of close friends that popped champagne for me when they found out,\" said Yang.",
      "Netflix's \u201cSquid Game\u201d universe is also growing. A second season of a reality competition show based on the series has been ordered and an English version is in development. Season three of the original has also completed filming and is in post-production.",
      "Season two is not without controversy. The new episodes feature a transgender character played by Park Sung-hoon. Hwang says he understands why hiring a trans actor would have been ideal, but that the casting is a reflection of how the LGBTQ community and gender identity is viewed in Korea.",
      "\u201cTo be honest with you, in Korea, when it comes to the LGBTQ and gender minority community and culture compared to the Western worlds, it\u2019s not as widely socially accepted yet. Unfortunately, a lot of the groups are marginalized and neglected from society, which is heartbreaking,\" said Hwang.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a very large pool of actors that allow for authentic casting when it comes to transgender characters. We did our research. We tried to find someone who we thought could be the best fit. However, we weren\u2019t able to.\u201d Hwang also went on to say that Park's talent and approach to the character ended up making him \u201cthe perfect fit.\u201d",

      "Wembanyama's presence is one reason the Spurs-Knicks matchup, the leadoff to the NBA's five-game Christmas slate, was the obvious choice to do the animated telecast.

      "\u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d debuted with $62 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates. With strong reviews (86% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and a high score from audiences (an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore), \u201cSonic 3\u201d is well positioned to be the top choice in cinemas during the busiest moviegoing period of the year.",
      "It was telling of some wider trends that \u201cSonic 3\u201d \u2014 made for $122 million \u2014 bested one of Disney\u2019s top properties. Videogame adaptations, once among the most derided movie genres, have emerged as one of the most dependable box office forces in recent years. The two previous \u201cSonic\u201d movies together grossed more $700 million worldwide and the third installment appears likely to do better than both of them. A fourth \u201cSonic\u201d movie is already in development.",
      "\u201cMufasa,\u201d however, was humbled in its opening weekend, coming in notably shy of expectations with $35 million in domestic ticket sales. The photorealistic \u201cLion King\u201d prequel even opened wider than \u201cSonic 3,\u201d launching on 4,100 theaters and gobbling up most IMAX screens, compared with 3,761 locations for \u201cSonic 3.\u201d",
      "Yet \u201cSonic 3\u201d nearly doubled the haul for \u201cMufasa,\u201d which cost more than $200 million to make. Disney could look to $87.2 million in international sales to help make up the difference. The third \u201cSonic\u201d will rollout in most overseas markets in the coming weeks.",
      "In director Jeff Fowler\u2019s \u201cSonic 3,\u201d Ben Schwartz returns as the voice of the hedgehog, alongside Tails the Fox (Colleen O\u2019Shaughnessey), Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba) and Jim Carrey in scene-stealing dual roles as Dr. Robotnik and his grandfather.",

It follows Jon Favreau\u2019s 2019 photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d remake, which made $1.66 billion globally despite mixed reviews. \u201cMufasa\u201d didn\u2019t come close to that film\u2019s huge $191 million opening weekend.",

Others, such as \u201cDumbo,\u201d \u201cMulan\u201d and \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d have been less well received. More are on the way, including a new \u201cSnow White\u201d in March, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d in May, and plans for \u201cMoana\u201d and \u201cTangled\u201d to get the same live-action treatment.",
      "Despite \u201cMufasa's\u201d muted opening, Disney is still celebrating its strongest annual performance in years. The studio has accounted for more than $5 billion in ticket sales worldwide, including the year\u2019s top two hits: \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine.\u201d The animated \u201cMoana 2\u201d is poised to round out the top three films of the year. In four weeks of release, it has collected $790.2 million globally, including $13.1 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters over this weekend.",

      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company based in Portland, Oregon, said Tuesday it had voluntarily recalled one batch of its two-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold through distributors in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada's British Columbia.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\u201d Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday news release. \u201cThis cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\u201d",
      "The recalled product is packaged in two-pound plastic bags with \u201cbest if used by\u201d dates of May 21, 2026, and June 23, 2026. The company and Oregon authorities said that consumers who bought the recalled product should throw it away immediately and contact the place of purchase for a refund.",
      "No human cases of bird flu have been linked to the incident, but those who were in contact with the cat are being monitored for flu symptoms, Oregon authorities said.",
      "More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. One person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation\u2019s first known severe illness caused by the virus, health officials said last week.",

      "President Joe Biden has signed the annual defense authorization bill into law despite his objections to language banning transgender health care for military children",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Monday signed into law a defense bill that authorizes significant pay raises for junior enlisted service members, aims to counter China's growing power and boosts overall military spending to $895 billion despite his objections to language stripping coverage of transgender medical treatments for children in military families.",
      "Biden said his administration strongly opposes the provision because it targets a group based on gender identity and \"interferes with parents\u2019 roles to determine the best care for their children.\u201d He said it also undermines the all-volunteer military's ability to recruit and retain talent.",
      "\u201cNo service member should have to decide between their family\u2019s health care access and their call to serve our nation,\u201d the president said in a statement.",
      "The Senate forwarded the bill to Biden after passing it last week by a vote of 85-14. In the House, a majority of Democrats voted against the bill after House Speaker Mike Johnson insisted on adding the provision to ban transgender medical care for children. The legislation easily passed by a vote of 281-140.",
      "Biden also objected to other language in the bill prohibiting the use of money earmarked to transfer detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to some foreign countries and into the United States. He urged Congress to lift those restrictions.",
      "The annual defense authorization bill, which directs Pentagon policy, provides a 14.5% pay raise for junior enlisted service members and a 4.5% increase for others.",
      "The legislation also directs resources towards a more confrontational approach to China, including establishing a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also invests in new military technologies, including artificial intelligence, and bolsters the U.S. production of ammunition.",
      "The U.S. has also moved in recent years to ban the military from purchasing Chinese products, and the defense bill extended that with prohibitions on Chinese goods from garlic in military commissaries to drone technology.",
      "The legislation still must be backed up with a spending package.",

      "The battles over abortion in the U.S. are increasingly focusing on the pills that are now the most common way pregnancies are ended",
      "Opponents of abortion are increasingly focusing on restricting access to pills, which are the most common way to end a pregnancy in the U.S.",
      "This month, the Texas attorney general's office filed a lawsuit against a New York doctor, saying she violated Texas law by prescribing abortion pills to a patient there via telemedicine. The suit represents the first lawsuit of its kind and could lead to a legal test for the New York law designed to protect providers there who prescribe the drugs to patients in states with abortion bans.",
      "Anti-abortion officials are taking other steps, too, through legislation and lawsuits.",
      "Abortion rights advocates are also concerned that President-elect Donald Trump's administration could take action to restrict access if it chose to.",
      "By the time the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to ban abortion, over half of all abortions were obtained using medication, usually a combination of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol.",
      "The drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they're pregnant. Studies have found they're generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.",
      "By last year, nearly two-thirds of abortions were from medications, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access.",
      "Much of the growth has been through abortion pills prescribed via telehealth and mailed to patients. A survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning found that by the first half of 2024, such prescriptions accounted for about one-tenth of abortions in the U.S.",
      "That number has risen rapidly since 2023 when some Democratic-controlled states started adopting laws that seek to protect medical providers in their borders who prescribe abortion pills via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cTelehealth for abortion has been a huge success,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the Center of Health and Community and the University of California San Francisco. \u201cIt has helped people in an incredible way.\u201d",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton rolled out a new strategy in the fight over pills this month when he sued Dr. Maggie Carpenter, who is based in New York, alleging she prescribed and sent pills to a Texas woman.",
      "New York is one of at least eight states with a law intended to protect medical providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states with bans.",
      "If Texas prevails upon a judge to block Carpenter from prescribing in the state, it's unclear what would happen next. New York's shield law would bar it from being enforced in New York, said David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University\u2019s Thomas R. Kline School of Law.",
      "Cohen said he expects any ruling would not have a major chilling effect on other doctors who prescribe out-of-state patients. \u201cThey certainly seem undeterred by legal risk,\u201d he said.",
      "And, he said, like illegal drugs, they'll continue to be available if there's a demand for them. Cohen said Paxton \u201cis going to plug one hole if he succeeds. There's no way he plugs them all.\u201d",
      "Pill prescribing has already withstood one key effort to block it. The U.S. Supreme Court this year ruled that a group of anti-abortion physicians and organizations that represent them lacked the legal standing to force the undoing of federal approvals for mifepristone.",
      "The state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri responded in October with a legal filing contending that they can make such an argument. Instead of focusing on the drug\u2019s initial approval in 2000, they\u2019re looking at later changes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that allow its use for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "There hasn't yet been a ruling on their case. When there is, it will likely be appealed to a higher court.",
      "This year, Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Some doctors said in a legal challenge that the change could cause delays in administering them in emergencies, such as when a woman is hemorrhaging after giving birth.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Avengo, director of the New Orleans Health Department, said that in the first few months of enforcement, she did not hear of any cases where the drugs could not be accessed in time.",
      "Additional states are considering ways to restrict abortion pills in their 2025 legislative sessions.",
      "In Tennessee, a Republican state lawmaker has proposed creating a $5 million civil liability against those who deliver or help access abortion pills with the intent of helping someone end a pregnancy.",
      "Rep. Gino Bulso said he filed the bill after learning that abortion pills were being sent to Tennessee despite state law prohibiting such actions. \u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d he said.",
      "A proposal in Missouri would make it a crime to deliver mifepristone or other drugs with the intent of causing an abortion. In November, the state's voters adopted a constitutional amendment to allow abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which is somewhere past 21 weeks into a pregnancy, though there's no fixed timeframe.",
      "Trump's administration also could take action on the pill policy.",
      "One approach that abortion rights advocates have warned about \u2014 and which some abortion opponents have suggested \u2014 includes enforcing an 1873 law against pills that bans mailing medications or instruments used in abortion. President Joe Biden's administration has declined to do so.",
      "The FDA could also change its approvals of the drugs, even without being forced to do so by a court ruling.",
      "During his campaign, Trump flip-flopped on abortion policy and at points attempted to distance himself from abortion opponents. Since he won the election, though, he has nominated abortion opponents to administration posts.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine published this month, he gave rambling answers to questions about pills. He said he intended to maintain access but also left the door open to changing his mind.",

      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- A judge ruled Friday that Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban is unenforceable under a new constitutional amendment, though Planned Parenthood said the decision is still not sufficient for it to resume providing abortions in the state.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Jerri Zhang said the abortion ban \u201cis directly at odds\u201d with a constitutional amendment creating a right to abortion that won voter approval in the November election. The judge also blocked the state from enforcing numerous other abortion restrictions, including a 72-hour waiting period and an informed consent law that required patients to be given certain state-mandated information before receiving an abortion.",
      "But the judge declined to block several other contested abortion laws, including one requiring abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities cannot comply with some of the licensing requirements, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "\u201cWhile Planned Parenthood stands ready to start providing abortions in Missouri again as soon as the Court permits, the abortion restrictions remaining in effect \u2014 including Missouri\u2019s medically unnecessary and discriminatory clinic licensing requirement \u2013 make this impossible,\u201d Planned Parenthood said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in the 2024 general election to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. The Missouri amendment did not specifically override any laws. Instead, advocates had to ask a court to knock down specific laws that they believe are now unconstitutional.",
      "Zhang\u2019s injunction is preliminary, but it signals that the judge is likely to ultimately find the abortion ban unconstitutional as the lawsuit plays out.",
      "Missouri had been among the first states to implement a prohibition on most abortions after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2022 overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent establishing a nationwide right to abortion.",
      "Attorney General Andrew Bailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday. Bailey, a Republican and abortion opponent, previously issued an opinion agreeing that most abortions would be legal when the amendment took effect.",
      "But Bailey\u2019s office is still fighting for a ban on most abortions after viability, along with a number of regulations that Planned Parenthood argues made it nearly impossible to offer abortions in the state even before abortion was almost completely banned in 2022.",
      "Zhang declined to block several contested Missouri abortion laws, including the licensure law, another limiting only physicians to performing abortions and still another requiring in-person appointments before abortions.",
      "Among the laws blocked by Friday's order was one prohibiting abortions solely because of a diagnosis indicating Down Syndrome. Also blocked was a telemedicine ban that requires a physician to be physically present in the room while a patient takes an abortion-causing medication. And the judge barred enforcement of another law requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at certain types of hospitals located within 30 miles (48 kilometers) or 15 minutes of where an abortion is performed.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability, with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy."

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A second attempt by Texas lawmakers to bring a man on death row to the state Capitol over doubts that he killed his 2-year-old daughter failed again Friday, dimming the likelihood of Robert Roberson testifying publicly after a last-minute subpoena halted his execution.",
      "Roberson, who had been scheduled to be die by lethal injection in October, would be the first person in the U.S. to be executed over a conviction tied to shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that medical experts have questioned.",
      "The latest unsuccessful effort to have Roberson testify comes after Texas' attorney general asked a court to block a second legislative subpoena issued by lawmakers, who are running out of time until the Legislature reconvenes in January and the subpoena expires.",
      "\u201cWe have been attempting to fight accommodation since October, and they have never responded to anything meaningfully because they don\u2019t want to have Robert here,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Joe Moody, one of the lawmakers who led the effort to halt Roberson\u2019s execution.",
      "Roberson, 58, was convicted of killing his daughter in 2003. Prosecutors argued that he violently shook his daughter back and forth, causing severe head trauma in what's called shaken baby syndrome.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers, civil rights advocates and medical experts have expressed doubts over the shaken baby diagnosis used to convict Roberson and say his daughter likely died from symptoms of severe pneumonia.",
      "The state's Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, has staunchly defended Roberson\u2019s conviction and said the science around shaken baby syndrome has not changed enough to absolve his guilt.",
      "In the court order, Paxton\u2019s office said that \u201cit is not the role of the Legislature to adjudicate offenses\u201d and that lawmakers overstepped their power when they halted his execution.",
      "The Texas House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence issued their first subpoena for Roberson to testify one day before his scheduled execution \u2014 an unprecedent legal maneuver that successfully staved off his execution.",
      "A new execution date has not been set.",

The House committee said they wanted Roberson to testify about this law and how they believe it has not worked as intended for his case.

      "Fentanyl fueled a record number of homeless deaths last year in Oregon\u2019s Multnomah County, home to Portland",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Fentanyl fueled a record number of homeless deaths last year in Oregon's Multnomah County, home to Portland, according to an annual county report released Friday that officials described as showing the peak of the fentanyl crisis in the area.",
      "The report found that 456 homeless people died in the county in 2023 \u2014 the highest number on record and a 45% jump compared to 2022. Last year's deaths included 282 from unintentional drug overdose \u2014 more than double the previous year \u2014 with fentanyl contributing to 89% of those fatalities.",
      "The increase in fentanyl-related deaths among homeless people mirrors national trends, the county said in a news release, and reflects the spread of the substance in recent years from the East Coast across the Western U.S. In 2017, fentanyl was recorded as contributing to the death of one homeless person in the county; by 2023, that number had reached 251.",
      "\u201cThe devastating toll fentanyl is taking on our community is starkly apparent in this report and it is heartbreaking,\u201d Multnomah County Chair Jessica Vega Pederson said in the news release. \u201cThis is a moment for our community to grieve alongside more than 450 families who lost loved ones in 2023 and to continue providing and fighting for more behavioral health, supportive housing and other resources to respond.\u201d",
      "Methamphetamine also contributed to 81% of 2023 homeless overdose deaths.",
      "Multnomah County Health Officer Richard Bruno said the report \u201chits close to the heart,\u201d as many of the people who died were patients that he cared for in clinic. But he added that he remained optimistic about the future, following a local and state emergency declaration to address the fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cAs we are seeing fentanyl overdose deaths decreasing in 2024, we are hopeful that future reports will hold much lower numbers,\u201d he said in the news release.",
      "Fourteen deaths were due to homicide, and 26 deaths were attributed to suicide. Twenty-two deaths were transportation-related, with the report noting that homeless people last year were 58 times more likely to die from a transportation-related injury compared to the county's general population.",
      "There were no deaths due to heat and one due to cold exposure, according to the report.",
      "The average age at death was 46 years, roughly 30 years younger than the national life expectancy at birth."

      "The U.S. flu season is underway",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. flu season is underway, with cases surging across much of the country, health officials said Friday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted sharp increases in several measures, including lab tests and emergency room visits.",
      "\u201cIt's been increasing at a pretty steady pace now for the past several weeks. So yeah, we are certainly in flu season now,\u201d said the CDC's Alicia Budd.",
      "Thirteen states reported high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week, about double from the week before. One is Tennessee, where a sickness spike is hitting the Nashville area, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.",
      "\u201cFlu has been increasing, but just this last week has exploded,\u201d Schaffner said. He noted that in a local clinic that serves as an indicator of illness trends, as many as a quarter of the patients have flu symptoms.",
      "Louisiana is another early hot spot.",
      "\u201cJust this week is really that turning point where people are out because of the flu,\" said Dr. Catherine O\u2019Neal, an infectious diseases doctor at the largest private hospital in the state, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. \"You hear parents saying, \u2018I can\u2019t come to work because of the flu\u2019 and \u2018Where can I get a flu test?\u2019\u201d",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC data show COVID-19 hospitalizations have been declining since summer. COVID-19 activity is moderate nationally, but high in the Midwest, according to CDC wastewater data.",
      "RSV hospitalizations started rising before flu did and now show signs of possibly leveling off, but they remain a little more common than admissions for flu. Overall, RSV activity is low nationally, but high in the South, the wastewater data show.",
      "The CDC called the start of flu season based on several indicators, include lab results for patients in hospitals and doctor's offices, and the percentage of emergency department visits that had a discharge diagnosis of flu.",
      "No flu strain seems to be dominant, and it's too early in the season to know how good a match the flu vaccine will be, Budd said.",
      "Last winter's flu season was considered \u201cmoderate\u201d overall, but it was long \u2014 21 weeks \u2014 and the CDC estimated there were 28,000 flu-related deaths. It was unusually dangerous for children, with 205 pediatric deaths reported. That was the highest number ever reported for a conventional flu season.",
      "The long season was likely a factor, Budd said. Another factor was a lack of flu vaccinations. Among the children who died who were old enough for flu vaccinations \u2014 and for whom their vaccination status was known \u2014 80% were not fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.",
      "Vaccination rates for children are even lower this year. As of Dec. 7, about 41% of adults had received a flu vaccination, similar to the rate at the same point last year. The percentage is the same for kids, but for them that\u2019s a drop from a year ago, when 44% were vaccinated against the flu, according to CDC data.",
      "Vaccination rates are lower still against COVID-19, with about 21% of adults and 11% of children up to date.",
      "Flu experts suggest everyone get vaccinated, especially as people prepare to attend holiday gatherings where respiratory viruses can spread widely.",
      "\u201cAll those gatherings that are so heartwarming and fun and joyous are also an opportunity for this virus to spread person to person,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cIt's not too late to get vaccinated.\u201d",

      "\"People are getting it right more often when they hear the neutral [version],\" Wesevich told MedPage Today. \"It's pretty compelling that there's some sort of distraction or cognitive effect of having to neutralize out the biased phrases.\"",
      "",
      "In an invited commentary, Somnath Saha, MD, MPH, and Mary Catherine Beach, MD, MPH, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, called the effect of biased language on information recall \"intriguing.\"",
      "",
      "\"At first glance, it seems that this effect might be a matter of simple distraction,\" they wrote. \"The human brain has finite capacity for retaining information, and the addition of clinically uninformative details might have crowded out information that was clinically important.\"",
      "",
      "The findings suggest that \"by engendering more negative attitudes toward the patient,\" they added, \"stigmatizing language may lessen the clinician's investment in the patient's well-being and thereby reduce the clinician's motivation to retain the information needed to provide optimal care for the patient.\"",
      "",
      "Wesevich and colleagues surveyed 169 residents and medical students (56% female, mean age 28.6), each of whom heard three recorded handoffs, which were a combination of neutral and biased. The biased handoffs were one of three types  --  stereotype, blame, or doubt  --  and they all came from a previous study by Wesevich's group.",
      "",
      "That study involved recording residents doing handoffs, and it found that biased phrases were more common in notes about patients who were Black or obese. While they changed small details to protect patient identity, the biased handoffs are largely true to the words used in the recorded handoffs in the earlier study, Wesevich told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "An example of a biased handoff with blame was about an adult patient with diabetes who \"cut her dose in half 2 months ago because she was having some falls and thought she was getting hypoglycemic but never actually checked her blood glucose.\" The neutral version of that handoff was rephrased to describe someone who \"cut her dose in half after experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms.\"",
      "",
      "After residents listened to three handoffs, the researchers followed up with three items: a multiple-choice clinical information recall question; an adapted version of the PASS scale to assess attitudes towards patients; and three open-ended \"key takeaway\" responses.",
      "",
      "Overall, Wesevich and colleagues found that those who heard biased handoffs had less accurate clinical information recall compared with those who heard neutral ones, but the difference wasn't statistically significant.",
      "",
      "They also found that those who reported bias as a key takeaway of the handoff had lower clinical information recall accuracy than those who did not (85% vs 93%; OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26-0.85, P=0.01).",
      "",
      "In addition, participants had lower empathy scores as measured by PASS item 2 when hearing biased handoffs compared with neutral ones (3.1 vs 3.3, P<0.001), and more positive attitudes toward patients were associated with higher clinical information recall accuracy (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22).",
      "",
      "Wesevich and colleagues concluded that biased handoffs can \"adversely impact the quality of care for Black patients\" as they impeded the accurate transfer of key clinical information and diminished empathy, \"potentially endangering patients and worsening health disparities.\"",
      "",
      "\"If you're trying to add context to who someone is ... and you choose negative phrases, you wield a lot of power about how that person is viewed,\" Wesevich said, adding that it would be helpful for physicians to have trainings or monitoring or \"accept the recommendations by multiple national organizations to standardize the handoff process.\"",
      "",
      "\"It's okay to recognize that we have biases and stereotypes,\" he added. \"If clinicians can accept that they're human beings that have things to work on, and by taking some of these measures, we can try to reduce the impact of implicit biases on the care of patients  --  that level of honesty and introspection will go a long way.\"",
      "",
      "The study was limited because the handoffs were simulated, and thus could be different in clinical settings. Also, the findings may not be generalizable outside of residents and medical students.",

    "story": [
      "A Japanese government panel has largely supported a draft energy policy calling for bolstering renewables up to half of Japanese electricity needs by 2040",
      "TOKYO -- A government-commissioned panel of experts on Wednesday largely supported Japan's new energy policy for the next few years that calls for bolstering renewables up to half of electricity needs by 2040 while maximizing the use of nuclear power as the country seeks to accommodate the growing power demand in the era of AI while meeting decarbonization targets.",
      "The Industry Ministry presented the draft plan for final review by the panel of 16 mostly pro-nuclear members from business, academia and civil groups. It calls for maximizing the use of nuclear energy, reversing a phaseout policy adopted after the meltdown crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011 that led to extensive displacement of residents and lingering anti-nuclear sentiment.",
      "The plan is due to receive Cabinet approval by March after a period of consultation and will then replace the current energy policy, which dates from 2021. The new proposal says nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan\u2019s energy supply in 2040, up from just 8.5% last year, while expanding renewables to 40-50% from 22.9% and reducing coal-fired power to 30-40% from nearly 70% last year.",
      "The current plan set a 20-22% target for nuclear energy, 36-38% for renewables and 41% for fossil fuel, for 2030.",
      "Demand for low-carbon energy, such as renewables and nuclear, is growing because of the demand from data centers using AI and semiconductor factories around the country.",
      "Industry Minister Yoji Muto, who attended Wednesday\u2019s panel meeting, said Japan must strengthen its energy security by not relying too much on a single source.",
      "\u201cHow we can secure decarbonized energy determines Japan\u2019s future growth,\u201d Muto said. \u201cIt's time to stop discussing a choice between renewable energy and nuclear power. We should maximize the use of both renewables and nuclear.\u201d",
      "Japan has set a goal of achieving net zero emissions of climate-warming gases by 2050, and a 73% reduction by 2040 compared to 2013 levels.",
      "The draft energy plan places renewables as the main power source and calls for development of next-generation energy source, such as solar batteries and portable solar panels.",
      "It outlines a number of risk scenarios, including a possibility of less-than-expected investment and cost reduction in renewables. However, some experts said the plan lacked a feasibility outlook for 2040 or a roadmap for the phaseout of fossil fuels.",
      "The plan also calls for acceleration of the restarts of reactors that meet the post-Fukushima safety standards, and proposes construction of next-generation reactors -- at plants where existing reactors are being decommissioned.",
      "Still, to achieve the 20% target, all 33 workable reactors in Japan must be back online, with only 14 back in service after the Fukushima disaster. Given the current pace of safety checks by the nuclear regulation authority, experts say meeting the target would be difficult.",
      "Despite criticisms and skepticism about its feasibility, Japan still sticks to its pursuit of developing advanced reactors and a struggling spent fuel reprocessing program to achieve a complete nuclear fuel cycle."

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia's striking university students on Wednesday rallied outside the chief prosecutor's office to demand justice over a concrete canopy collapse that killed 15 people last month in the country's north.",
      "More than 1,000 students symbolically left letters on the doorstep of the public prosecutor's office, telling chief prosecutor Zagorka Dolovac that \"students expect you to fight for law and justice, without political abuse or corruption.\u201d",
      "Dolovac's office later responded with a statement inviting a student delegation to a meeting.",
      "Serbia's universities have been blockaded for weeks as part of a wider movement demanding accountability over the Nov. 1 tragedy in Novi Sad when a huge concrete construction at the railway station crashed onto the people below.",

      "Prosecutors have arrested 13 people over the Novi Sad tragedy, including a government minister whose release later fueled public skepticism about the honesty of the investigation.",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Dec 2024 12:10:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Former Surinamese dictator Desi Bouterse has died at 79",
    "story": [
      "Former Surinamese dictator Desi Bouterse has died at 79",
      "PARAMARIBO, Suriname -- Desi Bouterse, a military strongman who led a 1980 coup in the former Dutch colony of Suriname then returned to power by election three decades later despite charges of drug smuggling and murder, has died. He was 79.",
      "Suriname's President Chan Santokhi on Wednesday reflected on Bouterse's outsized legacy in a message of condolences to his family and called on the nation to \"keep calm and maintain order.\u201d",
      "Vice President Ronnie Brunswijk wrote on Facebook that Bouterse\u2019s \u201clife had a lasting impact on our country and his efforts will not be forgotten.\u201d The cause of death was not immediately known.",
      "Bouterse was applauded by supporters for his charisma and populist social programs. For his opponents, he was a ruthless dictator who was convicted of drug trafficking and extrajudicial killings.",
      "In December 2023, Bouterse was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the murders of 15 opponents of the then-military government i n December 1982, ending a historic 16-year legal process. He then vanished and never served time in jail despite the sentencing.",
      "\u201cThere is nobody who has shaped the history of Suriname since its independence like Desi Bouterse,\u201d said Dutch historian Pepijn Reeser, who wrote a biography of Bouterse in 2015.",
      "He said that Bouterse was the first to overcome the stark social class divide that once defined Suriname.",
      "\u201cBefore the coup, it was unthinkable somebody from the lower class could become the most powerful man of the country. But he was also the first post-colonial leader to resort to political violence, and the first to use Suriname as a transshipment point for illegal narcotics,\u201d Reeser said.",
      "Early Wednesday, dozens of supporters gathered outside Bouterse\u2019s home where his wife lived, tears streaming down their faces. Many were dressed in purple, the color of his political party.",
      "Born Oct. 13, 1945, at a former sugar plantation near capital Paramaribo, Bouterse left for the Netherlands in 1968, as did thousands of other Surinamers in that era to seek adventure or a better life in Europe. Suriname was then still a colony, and as a Dutch citizen he was eligible for conscription, so he joined the armed forces a few months after arriving.",
      "He graduated from the Royal Military School and served at several Dutch army bases in the Netherlands and Germany. Bouterse returned to Suriname two weeks before it became an independent republic on Nov. 25, 1975, and joined its newly formed military. The initial optimism of young military men in serving their own country quickly turned into frustration over widespread favoritism and corruption in the consecutive governments of Prime Minister Henck Arron. When Arron forbade the troops from unionizing, 16 young soldiers led by Bouterse overthrew the government on Feb. 25, 1980, and made him the de facto ruler.",
      "\u201cWe took control because we want to save this country from ruin. There needs to be a total change of mentality to transform Suriname into the paradise it used to be,\u201d Bouterse said to a journalist a few hours after the coup.",
      "When promised democratic reforms did not materialize, opposition to Bouterse\u2019s military regime grew rapidly. Frictions between the military and opposition groups culminated in the killing of 15 men on Dec. 8, 1982. The victims were journalists, lawyers, military and university teachers, and their slaying became known as the \u201cDecember Murders.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe executions were a severe blow to the rule of law in Suriname from which the country still has not fully recovered,\u201d said Eddy Wijngaarde, a brother of journalist Frank Wijngaarde, one of the victims. \u201cThe impact of the December Murders goes beyond the death of these 15 men. Since December 1982, Bouterse used fear for him as a means to secure his powerful positions and personal interests.\u201d",
      "Shocked by the killings, the Netherlands suspended all development aid, disrupting life in Suriname. Ronnie Brunswijk, a former bodyguard of Bouterse, took up arms in 1986 in a bid to oust the dictator. For six years, the country\u2019s jungles were torn by a civil war in which both sides violated human rights and hundreds died.",
      "International isolation and the lack of domestic support for his military regime led Bouterse to accept free elections in November 1987. He established his own political movement, the National Democratic Party, but won only three of 51 seats in Parliament. Nonetheless, as commander of the armed forces, Bouterse kept a tight grip on the newly elected government of President Ramsewak Shankar.",
      "Following a conflict between Bouterse and Shankar in 1990, the army seized power again, dismissing Shankar with a phone call. Civilian rule was restored the following year. Bouterse officially left Suriname\u2019s army in 1993, and became what he described as a fulltime politician and businessman.",
      "In 1999, a Dutch court sentenced him in absentia to 11 years in prison for smuggling more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine to the Netherlands. The absence of an extradition treaty between the nations meant he never served his time in prison.",
      "In 2007, Suriname\u2019s military court started a trial against Bouterse and 24 others for their alleged roles in the December Murders of 1982.",
      "Bouterse was painted as the chief instigator by the prosecution. He maintained he was not present during the executions, although he said he accepted \u201cpolitical responsibility\u201d as army commander.",
      "\u201cI want to apologize to all the relatives of the victims. But to think you can lock me up? Never, niemals, jamais, nunca,\u201d Bouterse said during a televised speech in March 2007.",
      "While the trial dragged on for more than a decade, the former military leader reinvented himself as a politician by preaching nationalism and attracting support from many ethnic groups in Suriname, whose people have African, Asian, Amerindian, European and Middle Eastern roots.",
      "He was elected president for the first time in 2010. Instead of avoiding his past, he celebrated it. He quickly declared Feb. 25, the day of his military coup in 1980, a national holiday. He awarded other suspects in the December Murders case and coup plotters with high-ranking government jobs.",
      "\u201cDespite his controversial past, Bouterse was able to embody a new political dynamism, with strong leadership and a promising vision for the future,\u201d political scientist Hans Breeveld of the Anton de Kom University in Suriname said in an interview in 2015.",
      "Inspired by the socialist politics of then Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Bouterse continued construction of social housing, increased social welfare benefits and raised the government pension.",
      "These popular measures secured his reelection for another five-year term in 2015, but also proved to be an unpayable burden for the state. Large budget deficits and rampant inflation ensued. Consecutive devaluations of the Surinamese dollar in 2016 resulted in the currency losing more than half of its value in just a year.",
      "\u201cThe reckless economic policies of Bouterse have put a huge burden on our future generations, who are forced to repay millions of dollars of loans to international creditors,\u201d Surinamese economist Winston Ramautarsing told The Associated Press in 2016.",
      "With his support dwindling during his second term, Bouterse resorted to the tactics that he used during his dictatorship, including threatening the judges of his own murder trial during public events. History books for the country\u2019s high schools that mentioned the December Murders were banned. He regularly fired Cabinet ministers while blaming them for Suriname\u2019s problems.",
      "In 2012, the Bouterse administration proclaimed an internationally criticized amnesty law for the December Murders in an attempt to halt the murder trial. However, the law was ruled inapplicable by the military court in 2016, and in June 2017, the prosecutor recommended a 20-year prison sentence for Bouterse.",
      "\u201cIf it was God who made me president, who is this judge to try to send me away?\u201d Bouterse said. He tried to force out the attorney general, but the latter refused to quit.",
      "A verdict in the trial was expected in 2018. Bouterse said during a speech in August 2017 that he \u201calready knew\u201d he would be reelected for a third five-year term in the 2020 election. But he had been making regular trips to Cuba that were described as routine check-ups, and after returning in September 2017 from a monthlong stay, his office admitted the president had undergone surgery, although it refused to disclose more details.",
      "Bouterse was married twice and had three children, one son and two daughters. His son, Dino Bouterse, was serving a 16-year prison sentence in the U.S. for drug trafficking."

All three Americans, who were freed as part of the largest prisoner exchange since the end of the Cold War in August 2024, vehemently denied the charges brought against them, which range from espionage to spreading false information against the Russian army."

      "BEIJING -- China and Japan agreed Wednesday to set up talks on often contentious security issues as they seek to improve a relationship riven in recent years by a range of issues, from territorial disputes to the discharge of water from Japan's tsunami-wrecked nuclear power plant.",
      "Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, on his first trip to China since assuming the post in October, sounded positive after meetings with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, saying the talks were \u201cvery candid\" and wide-ranging.",
      "\u201cI feel we were able to build a personal relationship that would lead to the future,\" he told reporters in the Chinese capital.",
      "Wang agreed to visit Japan next year for a high-level economic dialogue including cooperation on the environment, energy conservation and health and nursing care. Japan announced an easing of visa requirements for Chinese visitors, following China's recent decision to allow Japanese to enter without a visa.",
      "The two countries also have major differences. Iwaya raised Japan's concerns about China's military activity near a group of uninhabited islands that both countries claim, as well as China's territorial disputes with other countries in the South China Sea.",
      "Efforts to improve ties are in their early stages following a commitment to do so made by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at a meeting last month during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru.",
      "\u201cCurrently China-Japan relations are at a critical period of improvement and development,\u201d Li said at the start of his meeting with Iwaya. \u201cChina is willing to work together with Japan to move toward the important direction proposed by the leaders of the two countries.\u201d",
      "Iwaya's one-day trip came just before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January and the uncertainty his presidency is expected to bring to America's global relations.",
      "Trump has threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese goods, reigniting a trade war he unleashed in his first administration. It's unclear how he will impact the U.S.-Japan alliance, which President Joe Biden has sought to buttress during the last four years as part of his strategy to confront a rising China.",
      "Japan has revamped its approach to defense i n response to Chinese actions in recent years, boosting military spending and shifting away from a principle of self-defense. Earlier this year, Japan protested when a Chinese military plane flew into Japan\u2019s airspace, while in the summer, a Chinese survey ship sailed into Japanese territorial waters.",
      "Wang agreed to Iwaya's proposal for a Japan-China security dialogue, which would try to improve communication over some of these issues.",
      "Iwaya called for an early lifting of a ban on Japanese seafood imports that China imposed after a Japanese utility began discharging treated but still radioactive water from the former nuclear power plant in Fukushima.",
      "The two sides agreed to keep working on the issue, and also resume talks on Japanese beef and rice exports to China.",
      "Japan's easing of visa requirements included allowing group tours to stay for 30 days, up from 15, and increasing the validity of multiple-entry tourist visas from five to 10 years.",
      "Both sides hope that people-to-people exchanges can help improve relations.",
      "In that context, Iwaya asked China to improve security for his country's citizens, following recent attacks on Japanese school children, and also raised the detention of several Japanese businesspeople on spy charges. Both are making some Japanese hesitant to travel or work in China, he said.",

    "summary": "King Charles III is expected to use his annual Christmas message to highlight health workers, at the end of a year in which both he and the Princess of Wales were diagnosed with cancer",
    "story": [
      "King Charles III is expected to use his annual Christmas message to highlight health workers, at the end of a year in which both he and the Princess of Wales were diagnosed with cancer",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 King Charles III  and close members of the royal family attended Christmas Day services Wednesday at a church on Sandringham, the estate on the windswept North Sea coast that has served as a retreat for the royals for generations.",
      "The monarch, who is suffering from cancer, waved to a large crowd of onlookers who traditionally gather outside the church in hopes of catching a glimpse of the royal parade before and after the service. Also in attendance was the Princess of Wales, the king\u2019s daughter-in-law, who has been slowly returned to public duties after completing a course of chemotherapy.",
      "In a reflection of the medical treatments they have received, Charles is expected to use his annual Christmas message broadcast later in the day to highlight health workers.",
      "One familiar face was absent from the traditional scene outside St. Mary Magdalene Church: Prince Andrew. The king\u2019s 64-year-old brother has retreated further into the shadows amid news that a Chinese businessman had been barred from the U.K. because of concerns he cultivated links with Andrew on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has become a constant source of tabloid fodder because of his money woes and links to questionable characters, including the late American financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Even though Andrew had stepped back from public duties, he has continued to appear at family events and his absence from Sandringham suggests a further retreat from the public eye. The king has been under pressure to put more distance between Andrew and the royal family to avoid further embarrassment to the monarchy.",
      "While Andrew has said he never discussed anything sensitive with the suspected Chinese spy and that he ceased contact with the man as soon as concerns were raised, the scandal raises further questions about his judgment and distracts from the work of the royal family, said Ed Owens, author of \u201cAfter Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cThe reason why this is a problem for the king is simply that the king is trying to rebrand the monarchy at the moment, centering its focus around him, but also around William, Catherine, what they are trying to do,\u201d Owens said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a very difficult year for the monarchy, not least because of the two cancer diagnoses. And all the positive headlines that the king has been trying to generate of late, unfortunately, are overshadowed by the behavior, the reckless behavior, of his younger brother, who once again finds himself in the headlines.\u201d",
      "Charles' speech was recorded at Fitzrovia Chapel in London, which was part of the now-demolished Middlesex Hospital where his first wife, Diana, opened London\u2019s first dedicated ward for those with AIDS. The building is richly decorated in a Gothic Revival style featuring more than 500 stars in a gold leaf ceiling.",
      "\u201cI assume that this space, being one of calm reflection, but also thinking about health, about care, about the medical profession, would make it a pretty apt choice,\u201d said Carla Whalen, chair of the Fitzrovia Chapel Foundation\u2019s board of trustees.",
      "The broadcast is watched by millions of people in the United Kingdom and across the Commonwealth.",
      "In keeping with the King\u2019s desire to go into the community, he tasked the team organizing the broadcast with finding a site away from the royal estate. It's a rare occasion when the monarch's Christmas message is not recorded from one of the royal residences, notably Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. The last time his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, recorded her message outside the royal estate was in 2006.",
      "The criteria were clear: the building had to have health connections, a strong community presence and a place of solace and reflection for those with faith or none.",
      "This is the king\u2019s third Christmas speech since he ascended the throne after the queen died in September 2022. It is the first since he was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February.",
      "His treatment forced him to step away from public appearances for two months. The 76-year-old monarch has slowly returned to public life in recent months and was in good spirits on a tour of Australia with his wife, Queen Camilla, in October.",
      "It's been a difficult year for the royal family. A few weeks after Charles began treatment, the Princess of Wales announced her own cancer diagnosis, which sidelined her for much of the year as she underwent chemotherapy.",
      "In a voiceover for the broadcast of her annual Christmas carol service at Westminster Abbey, which was recorded this month but broadcast on Tuesday evening, Kate reflected on the love and support that she has received.",
      "\u201cThe Christmas story encourages us to consider the experiences and feelings of others,\" she said. \u201cIt also reflects our own vulnerabilities and reminds us of the importance of giving and receiving empathy, as well as just how much we need each other in spite of our differences.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Camilla has had a lingering chest infection in recent weeks and hasn\u2019t been able to attend certain events, including last month\u2019s remembrance service for fallen service personnel.",
      "Camilla walked alongside the king to the church with Prince William, Kate and their three children following. Charles' other siblings, Anne, the Princess Royal, and Edward, the Prince of Edinburgh, were also in the procession.",
      "Charles has long taken refuge at Sandringham, one of the most famous stately homes in Britain. It sits on an 8,000-hectare (20,000-acre) estate in Norfolk on the eastern coast of England.",
      "The private home of the last six British monarchs, Sandringham sits amid parkland, gardens and working farms about 110 miles (180 kilometers) north of London. It has been owned by the royal family since 1862, passing directly from one monarch to the next for more than 160 years.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis kicked off the 2025 Holy Year on Tuesday, inaugurating a celebration of the Catholic Church that is expected to draw some 32 million pilgrims to Rome in a test of the pope's stamina and the ability of the Eternal City to welcome them.",
      "From his wheelchair, Francis knocked a few times and the great Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica swung open. He was wheeled across the threshold as bells tolled across Rome and the choir inside the basilica began Christmas Eve Mass.",
      "In his homily, Francis said the Holy Year is an opportunity to relieve the debt of poor countries and commit to protecting the planet. The aim of the Jubilee, he said, is \u201cto bring hope to the interminable, dreary days of prisoners, to the cold and dismal lodgings of the poor and to all those places desecrated by war and violence.\u201d",
      "The ceremony inaugurated the once-every-25-year tradition of a Jubilee, in which the Catholic faithful make pilgrimages to Rome.",
      "Francis has dedicated the 2025 Jubilee to the theme of hope, and he will underscore that message when he opens a Holy Door on Thursday at Rome\u2019s Rebibbia prison in a bid to give inmates hope for a better future. Francis has long incorporated prison ministry into his priestly vocation, and has made several visits to Rebibbia and other prisons during his travels.",
      "Security around the Vatican was at its highest levels following the Christmas market attack last week in Germany, the interior ministry said.",

      "Francis, who turned 88 last week, went into the Christmas week and Jubilee launch with a cold that forced him to deliver his weekly Sunday blessing from indoors. But he appeared in fine form Tuesday night. His health and stamina, already compromised because of his tendency to get bronchitis, are a concern given the rigorous calendar of events during the Holy Year.",
      "One of the highlights will be the canonization of the teenage internet whiz Carlo Acutis, considered the first millennial and digital-era saint, during the Jubilee dedicated to adolescents in April.",
      "This week, Francis also delivers his annual \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d (to the city and the world) speech on Christmas Day from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. In addition to the outing at Rebibbia, he will celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve vespers and a New Year\u2019s Day Mass.",
      "The city of Rome entered the Jubilee with some trepidation. It has undergone two years of traffic-clogging public works upgrades of transportation, hospital emergency rooms and other vital services, testing residents' patience.",
      "But only about a third of the 323 projects have been completed, and the city is already groaning under the weight of overtourism. Visitors have returned to Italy in droves following COVID-19, and the explosion of short-term vacation rentals has exacerbated a housing crisis.",
      "Some of Rome's prized monuments have reopened recently, including the Trevi Fountain.

      "The last regular Jubilee was in 2000, when St. John Paul II ushered in the church\u2019s third millennium. The one before that, in 1975, was notable because Pope Paul VI was nearly hit by falling plaster when he opened the Holy Door.

      "Survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki said being recognised with a Nobel Peace Prize has given them a new incentive to push for nuclear disarmament ahead of the 80th anniversary next year of the attacks",
      "TOKYO -- Survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki said receiving a Nobel Peace Prize has given them a fresh incentive to campaign for nuclear disarmament ahead of the 80th anniversary of the 1945 attacks.",
      "\u201cI felt like I needed to work even harder on what I had done so far,\u201d said Terumi Tanaka, who survived the atomic attack on Nagasaki on Aug. 9. 1945.",

      "Next year marks \u201ca significant milestone of 80 years\u201d since the end of World War II, Tanaka, who is co-chair of Nihon Hidankyo, said.",
      "\u201cI believe it is important to focus on the next 10 years and strengthen the movement moving forward,\u201d he added. \u201cI would like to lead a big movement of testimonials.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat else is there for Japan, the only country to have suffered atomic attacks, to do other than leading the nuclear disarmament?\u201d",
      "That\u2019s what Tanaka said he will ask Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who supports nuclear deterrence, when they are expected to meet in January. Japan, protected under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, has refused to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons despite repeated requests by survivors.",
      "Michiko Kodama, who survived the first atomic bombing, on Hiroshima three days before the Nagasaki blast, said she felt the Nobel award and the congratulatory messages were so rewarding after decades of hardship, discrimination and fear of health effects from radiation, but she wants more people to know what nuclear weapons really do to them.",
      "\u201cWe hibakusha (survivors) who saw the hell... within a decade won't be around to tell the reality of the atomic bombing,\u201d said Kodama, who was 7 in August 1945. \u201cI want to keep telling our stories as long as we live.\u201d",
      "Nihon Hidankyo is a grassroots movement of Japanese atomic bombing survivors who have worked for nearly 70 years to maintain a taboo around the use of nuclear weapons. The weapons have grown exponentially in power and number since being used for the first and only time in warfare by the United States on Japan.",
      "The first U.S. atomic bombing killed 140,000 people in the city of Hiroshima. A second atomic attack on Nagasaki killed another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, bringing an end to a conflict that began with Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 during its attempt to conquer Asia.",

      "Ankara sees the SDF as an affiliate of its sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which it classifies as a terrorist organization.

      "The riots, which caused an international outcry and accusations of deliberate anti-Semitic attacks, left 5 people in hospital and 20 others with minor injuries. More than 60 suspects were detained.",

      "A series of violent incidents took place between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli soccer fans around the soccer match.",
      "Some of the violence was condemned as anti-Semitic, with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offering to evacuate Maccabi supporters. The violence, which garnered headlines world-wide, damaged Amsterdam\u2019s reputation as a beacon of tolerance and haven for persecuted religions, including Jews.",
      "\u201cIt seems that the violence arose from strong pro-Palestine sentiments and dissatisfaction with the situation in Gaza, and related anger against the Israelis present,\u201d the prosecutors\u2019 office said in a statement at the conclusion of hearings two weeks ago.",
      "The five defendants, aged between 19 and 32, were accused of public violence, theft and assault.",
      "The Nov. 8 game was allowed to go ahead after The Netherlands\u2019 counter-terror watchdog found there was no \u201cconcrete threat\u201d to Israeli fans, and the match wasn\u2019t considered a high risk. Even so, Amsterdam authorities banned a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the Johan Cruyff Arena.",
      "According to an investigation, the day before the game the authorities reported several incidents, including Israeli fans tearing a Palestinian from an Amsterdam building and attacking a cab. In response, taxi drivers sought to mobilize online, centering on a casino where some 400 Israeli fans were gathered. Police were mobilized to avoid a major confrontation.",
      "Six more suspects will have their trials on a later date, including three minors. Under Dutch rules, proceedings for juveniles are held behind closed doors. Police are continuing to investigate the violence and have released images of several suspects they hope to identify.",

      "A Japanese government panel has largely supported a draft energy policy calling for bolstering renewables up to half of Japanese electricity needs by 2040",
      "TOKYO -- A government-commissioned panel of experts on Wednesday largely supported Japan's new energy policy for the next few years that calls for bolstering renewables up to half of electricity needs by 2040 while maximizing the use of nuclear power as the country seeks to accommodate the growing power demand in the era of AI while meeting decarbonization targets.",
      "The Industry Ministry presented the draft plan for final review by the panel of 16 mostly pro-nuclear members from business, academia and civil groups. It calls for maximizing the use of nuclear energy, reversing a phaseout policy adopted after the meltdown crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011 that led to extensive displacement of residents and lingering anti-nuclear sentiment.",
      "The plan is due to receive Cabinet approval by March after a period of consultation and will then replace the current energy policy, which dates from 2021. The new proposal says nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan\u2019s energy supply in 2040, up from just 8.5% last year, while expanding renewables to 40-50% from 22.9% and reducing coal-fired power to 30-40% from nearly 70% last year.",
      "The current plan set a 20-22% target for nuclear energy, 36-38% for renewables and 41% for fossil fuel, for 2030.",
      "Demand for low-carbon energy, such as renewables and nuclear, is growing because of the demand from data centers using AI and semiconductor factories around the country.",
      "Industry Minister Yoji Muto, who attended Wednesday\u2019s panel meeting, said Japan must strengthen its energy security by not relying too much on a single source.",
      "\u201cHow we can secure decarbonized energy determines Japan\u2019s future growth,\u201d Muto said. \u201cIt's time to stop discussing a choice between renewable energy and nuclear power. We should maximize the use of both renewables and nuclear.\u201d",
      "Japan has set a goal of achieving net zero emissions of climate-warming gases by 2050, and a 73% reduction by 2040 compared to 2013 levels.",
      "The draft energy plan places renewables as the main power source and calls for development of next-generation energy source, such as solar batteries and portable solar panels.",
      "It outlines a number of risk scenarios, including a possibility of less-than-expected investment and cost reduction in renewables. However, some experts said the plan lacked a feasibility outlook for 2040 or a roadmap for the phaseout of fossil fuels.",
      "The plan also calls for acceleration of the restarts of reactors that meet the post-Fukushima safety standards, and proposes construction of next-generation reactors -- at plants where existing reactors are being decommissioned.",
      "Still, to achieve the 20% target, all 33 workable reactors in Japan must be back online, with only 14 back in service after the Fukushima disaster. Given the current pace of safety checks by the nuclear regulation authority, experts say meeting the target would be difficult.",
      "Despite criticisms and skepticism about its feasibility, Japan still sticks to its pursuit of developing advanced reactors and a struggling spent fuel reprocessing program to achieve a complete nuclear fuel cycle.",

      "The top speed record was possible thanks to the ZR1\u2019s turbocharged 5.5-liter V8 engine that cranks out a staggering 1,064 horsepower. Its carbon-fiber aero package kept it glued to the track by generating over 1,200 pounds of downforce at top speed. Chevrolet also says the ZR1 can accelerate through the quarter mile in less than 10 seconds. We expect the Corvette ZR1 to go on sale in early 2025.",
      "Estimated starting price: $150,000",
      "Does your wish list include a big and powerful SUV? If it does, the Escalade-V should top it. The big Caddy roars like a muscle car thanks to its supercharged 6.2-liter V8 that churns out 682 horsepower and helps it hit 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds. The Escalade-V also boasts enormous 24-inch wheels and large Brembo brakes that help bring the three-ton SUV to a stop.",
      "But the Escalade-V isn\u2019t only about brute power. It also has three rows of seating, plenty of cargo space and offers impressive tech like Super Cruise, a hands-free highway driving system, and an enormous 55-inch curved display that spans the dashboard.",
      "Starting Price: $161,990",
      "What if we told you there was a car that could outpace almost anything on a drag strip, keep up with high-end sports cars on a racetrack, and be comfortable enough for daily errands? Well, if that sounds amazing, add the Air Sapphire to your dream list.",
      "The Air Sapphire is a high-performance electric luxury sedan made by Lucid, an electric vehicle startup. It\u2019s one of the most powerful production cars in the world, producing an astonishing 1,234 horsepower from its three electric motors. Lucid says it has a top speed of 205 mph and can rocket to 60 mph in a mind-numbing 1.9 seconds. You can adjust the vehicle\u2019s setting for exceptional track performance or simply provide a comfortable ride around town.",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil -- A task force led by Brazilian prosecutors said it rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \u201cslavery-like\" conditions at a construction site in northeastern Brazil, where Chinese electric vehicle company BYD is building a factory.",
      "On Tuesday, the Labor Prosecutor\u2019s Office released videos of the dorms where the construction workers were staying, which showed beds with no mattresses and rooms without any places for the workers to store their personal belongings.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, the prosecutor\u2019s office said the workers had been hired in China by Jinjiang Construction Brazil, one of the contractors on the site, which is located in Cama\u00e7ari, a city in the Salvador metropolitan region.",

    "summary": "American Airlines briefly grounded flights nationwide due to a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive and winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive",
    "story": [
      "American Airlines briefly grounded flights nationwide due to a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive and winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- American Airlines briefly grounded flights nationwide Tuesday because of a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive and winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive.",
      "Government regulators cleared American flights to get airborne about an hour after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered a national ground stop for the airline. The order, which prevented planes from taking off, was issued at the airline's request after it experienced trouble with its flight operating system, or FOS. The airline blamed technology from one of its vendors.",
      "As a result, flights were delayed across American\u2019s major hubs, with only 37% of the airline's 3,901 domestic and international flights leaving on time, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. Nineteen flights were canceled.",
      "Dennis Tajer, a spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, a union representing American Airlines pilots, said the airline told pilots at 7 a.m. Eastern that there was an outage affecting the FOS system. It handles different types of airline operations, including dispatch, flight planning, passenger boarding, as well as an airplane's weight and balance data, he said.",
      "Some components of FOS have gone down in the past, but a systemwide outage is rare, Tajer said.",
      "Hours after the ground stop was lifted, Tajer said the union had not heard about any \u201cchaos out there beyond just the normal heavy travel day.\u201d He said officials were watching for any cascading effects, such as staffing problems.",
      "On social media, however, customers expressed frustrations about delays that caused them or their family members to miss connecting flights. One person asked if American planned to hold flights for passengers to make connections, while others complained about the lack of assistance they said they received from the airline or gate agents.",
      "Cirium noted that the vast majority of flights were departing within two hours of their scheduled departure time. A similar percentage \u2014 36% \u2014 were arriving at their destinations as scheduled.",
      "Dallas-Fort Worth, New York\u2019s Kennedy Airport and Charlotte, North Carolina, saw the greatest number of delays, Cirium said. Washington, Chicago and Miami experienced considerably fewer delays.",
      "Meanwhile, the flight-tracking site FlightAware reported that 4,058 flights entering or leaving the U.S., or serving domestic destinations, were delayed, with 76 flights canceled. The site had not posted any American Airlines flights on Tuesday morning, but showed in the afternoon that 961 American flights were delayed.",
      "Amid the travel problems, significant rain and snow were expected in the Pacific Northwest at least into Christmas Day. Showers and thunderstorms were developing in the South. Freezing rain was reported in the Mid-Atlantic region near Baltimore and Washington, and snow fell in New York.",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \u201cinterline agreements\u201d that let them put stranded customers on another carrier\u2019s flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That\u2019s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline tends to be expensive.",
      "An American spokesperson said Tuesday was not a peak travel day for the airline \u2014 with about 2,000 fewer flights than the busiest days \u2014 so the airline had somewhat of a buffer to manage the delays.",
      "The groundings happened as millions of travelers were expected to fly over the next 10 days. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers through Jan. 2.",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Thursday, Friday and Sunday.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations more disruptive than during slower periods. Even with just a brief outage, the cancellations have a cascading effect that can take days to clear up.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\u201cAirline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\u201d AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.04 a gallon, down from $3.13 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation\u2019s highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",

    "summary": "North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper leaves his job next week after eight years",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper leaves his job next week after eight years",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is leaving his job after eight years in which the southern Democrat picked his moments against a Republican-dominated legislature, winning big on Medicaid expansion and clean energy while falling short in fights over private-school vouchers and abortion rights.",
      "Cooper, who steered the state through the coronavirus pandemic, Hurricanes Helene and Florence and an early flashpoint in the culture wars over access to public restrooms, was barred from seeking a third consecutive term. He is wrapping up 24 consecutive years in statewide office \u2014 the first 16 as attorney general.",
      "In a December interview with The Associated Press at the executive mansion, Cooper reflected on his gubernatorial terms with an emphasis on the positive \u2014 an easier undertaking compared with many Democrats around the country in the aftermath of this year's election.",
      "\"To be able to wake up every morning and get to lead the state that you love has been humbling, challenging and fulfilling. I have really valued every day,\u201d said Cooper, who will be succeeded by state Attorney General Josh Stein, a fellow Democrat, in early January.",
      "Faced with veto-proof majorities for almost half of his time as governor, Cooper was unable to stop many GOP initiatives, including deep income tax cuts, taxpayer-funded vouchers to help public school students attend private schools and new restrictions on abortion.",
      "But Cooper, one of several Democratic governors seen as potential contenders for federal office, managed last year to persuade GOP legislative leaders to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 something he had sought since getting sworn in as governor in 2017. Now 600,000 low-income adults are enrolled in the program a year ahead of expectations.",
      "\u201cThis is a generational investment in people\u2019s health,\u201d Cooper said during a farewell address last week in Nash County, where he grew up and launched his first gubernatorial campaign in 2015. Another bipartisan agreement was reached in 2021 on a milestone energy bill that ordered sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.",
      "Cooper takes credit for conditions that led to big corporate expansions that he says have contributed to hundreds of thousands of new jobs being created during the past eight years, including those in the clean energy sector. But he also gives his rare praise to Republican lawmakers for all working together on offering economic incentives that have lured companies such as Apple, Toyota and Boom Supersonic to build in the state.",
      "Still, Republicans contend Cooper receives too much acclaim for the state\u2019s broad economic success and has pushed for reckless state spending at every turn. Half of his record 100-plus vetoes were overridden.",
      "\u201cThere has not been a governor who has had less of his agenda enacted and North Carolina has succeeded in spite of his leadership failures,\" state GOP spokesperson Matt Mercer said.",
      "Regardless, Cooper\u2019s perceived accomplishments in a swing state raised his national profile during this year\u2019s presidential campaign, making him as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris until he said it \"just wasn\u2019t the right time\" for him and for North Carolina. Now Cooper, 67, will have to decide whether trying to unseat U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, in 2026 is in the cards after holding what he calls the \u201cbest job I have ever had.\u201d",
      "While North Carolina Democrats have won eight of past nine gubernatorial elections, they haven\u2019t won a U.S. Senate race since 2008.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to run for public office again, you must have your heart and soul in it, you must have the fire in the belly,\u201d Cooper told the AP.",
      "With that in mind, he said he planned to take a couple of months to clear his head before deciding what\u2019s next: \u201cI\u2019m going to think about how I can best contribute to the things that I care about.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s little wonder why many North Carolina Democrats want Cooper to remain on the political stage. He has never lost a race for state office, from the legislature in the mid-1980s and including a 10,000-vote win over then-GOP Gov. Pat McCrory in 2016.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s done really from my perspective is he\u2019s kept the progressive flame alive in North Carolina in a difficult time,\u201d said Gary Pearce, a longtime Democratic political consultant who worked with four-term Gov. Jim Hunt. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody else could have done it as well as he did.\u201d",
      "Cooper took on Republicans even before he was sworn in.",
      "As governor-elect he began a series of lawsuits challenging legislation approved weeks before he took office that shifted executive branch powers to the legislature. The legal results were mixed, and even now litigation over his appointment powers remains in court. This month, Republican lawmakers enacted more changes that would weaken Stein's gubernatorial authority. Two lawsuits related to that law have been filed so far.",
      "In his first three months in office, Cooper worked with lawmakers to partially repeal the 2016 \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which had required transgender people to use public bathrooms aligned with the gender on their birth certificate. The law had lost the state business, including canceled sporting events and job expansions, and \u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s reputation was in tatters,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Eight years later, \u201cwe built a North Carolina that is healthier, better educated, with more money in people\u2019s pockets, and we stand ready to welcome prosperity with open arms for generations to come,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Republicans cite several shortcomings in Cooper's administration. They include spending overruns at the state Department of Transportation; continued delays to rebuild or renovate homes for eastern North Carolina residents after Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018; and executive orders that helped extend restrictions on businesses and school instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful dealing with the governor fiscally,\u201d Republican state Sen. Warren Daniel said. \u201cI just think he\u2019s not very good at managing government.\u201d",
      "Cooper has defended his actions, particularly his pandemic leadership, saying North Carolina came out better than many other states.",
      "Even in policy defeats, Cooper secured the admiration of supporters. The Democratic governor used lots of political capital in 2023 trying unsuccessfully to block a law that changed the state\u2019s ban on most abortions from after 20 weeks of pregnancy to 12 weeks. Republicans overrode his veto.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s simply no governor who\u2019s ever fought as hard or as publicly as Gov. Cooper has to protect access to abortion,\u201d said Paige Johnson with Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Plenty of North Carolinians see that differently. Cooper\u2019s opposition to the abortion bill reflects an administration that \u201chas been consistently hostile to policies that serve the best interests of North Carolina families,\u201d said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition.",
      "Cooper said he has confidence that Stein, who succeeded him as attorney general, will \u201ccontinue a lot of the progress that we have made.\u201d Cooper hired Stein two decades ago, while attorney general, to be his consumer protection chief.",
      "Otherwise, Cooper knows that he\u2019ll miss \u201chaving the opportunity every single day to do something to make a real difference.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you can do in this job,\u201d he added. \"And whatever I decide to do, that\u2019s going to be hard to replicate.\""

    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel",
      "WASHINGTON -- A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving the decision to President Joe Biden, who opposes the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March. He has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "Both Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is giving up Nippon Steel's potential investments in the mills and upgrades that might help preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "Under the terms of the proposed $14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steelmakers in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\u201d",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \u201cblock this deal from happening.\u201d He proposed reviving U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \u201cthrough a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\u201d",
      "The steelworkers union questions if Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\u201cOur union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it\u2019s up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\u201d David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\u201d",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \u201cis the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\u201d",
      "Nippon Steel said Tuesday that it had been informed by CFIUS that it had referred the case to Biden, and urged him to \u201creflect on the great lengths that we have gone to to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U. S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that our transaction should and will be approved if it is fairly evaluated on its merits,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "A growing number of conservatives have publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and officials in areas near its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America\u2019s manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement to protect national security.",
      "Congress significantly expanded the committee's powers through the 2018 Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Biden issued an executive order broadening the factors the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how they impact the U.S. supply chain or if they put Americans\u2019 personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel has factories in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world\u2019s top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

      "A five-day strike by Starbucks baristas had closed 59 stores as of Monday afternoon, according to the union organizing the workers.",
      "The strike, which began Friday in Los Angeles, Chicago and Starbucks' hometown of Seattle, spread Monday to stores in Boston, Dallas and Portland, Ore. Workers in New York, Denver, Pittsburgh and other cities had also joined the strike over the weekend.",
      "Workers are protesting a lack of progress in contract negotiation with the company. Starbucks Workers United, which began the unionization effort in 2021, said Starbucks has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year.",
      "The union also wants the company to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. Since 2021, baristas at 535 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to join the union.",
      "The strike comes at one of the busiest times of the year for Starbucks. But the company said Monday it has had \u201cno significant impact\u201d to its store operations. Starbucks has around 10,000 company-operated stores in the U.S.",

Starbucks said it has committed to an annual pay increase of 1.5% or more for unionized workers.

      "A chemical company official has been charged in connection with the unauthorized discharge of oil that left a miles-long dark, oily sheen on the Flint River in Michigan",
      "FLINT, Mich. -- The president of a chemical company has been charged in connection with the unauthorized discharge of oil that left a miles-long dark, oily sheen on the Flint River in Michigan more than two years ago.",
      "Rajinder Singh Minhas, 60, of Rochester, Michigan, was arrested and arraigned last week on charges of falsely altering a public record, substantial endangerment to the public, discharge of injurious substance to waters of the state, false statements and omissions regarding air pollution control and other charges, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said Monday.",
      "Minhas also served as director and treasurer of Flint-based Lockhart Chemical which manufactures coatings, metalworking additives, hydraulic fluids and lubricants.",
      "Critical maintenance and upgrades at the facility allegedly were mismanaged and neglected, Nessel said in a release.",
      "About 15,000 gallons of an oil-chemical mixture was released June 15, 2022. The spill came from a storm sewer that discharges into the river, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said at the time.",
      "The state later required the company to immediately stop using defective wastewater and stormwater conveyance systems and to make other changes. Lockhart has since filed for bankruptcy.",
      "Officials said Flint\u2019s drinking water was not threatened. Flint used the river for drinking water in 2014-15 before lead contamination caused the city to return to Lake Huron water provided by a regional supplier.",
      "Minhas has been released on a personal bond and is due back in court Jan. 2 for a probable cause conference, according to court records.",
      "The Associated Press attempted Monday to reach Lockhart Chemical for comment but the telephone number listed for the company was disconnected. A voicemail seeking comment was left Monday afternoon for Minhas' attorney."

      "Government safety regulators are closing an investigation into two previous recalls of the Ford Focus after determining that Ford Motor Co. has satisfied its concerns",
      "Government safety regulators said Monday they have closed an investigation into two previous recalls of the Ford Focus after determining that Ford Motor Co. has satisfied its concerns.",
      "In 2018, Ford recalled around 1.5 million Ford Focus sedans from the 2012-2018 model years because they could lose power. The issue was a malfunctioning canister purge valve and software that didn\u2019t adequately detect when it was stuck open. If the valve was stuck open, excessive vacuum could build up in the fuel management system and deform the fuel tank.",
      "Five crashes and two injuries were reported related to the issue, but no fatalities.",
      "Ford fixed the software in that recall and updated the software again in a separate 2019 recall. But in 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into those previous recalls after receiving 98 consumer complaints alleging that their Ford Focus sedans still lost power.",
      "This fall, Ford began offering a customer satisfaction program that will replace the canister purge valve in the affected vehicles. Ford said the valve may not function properly, which can cause the vehicle to hesitate or stall at low speeds.",
      "NHTSA said Ford\u2019s latest program resolves its concerns so it\u2019s closing its investigation into the previous recalls.",

    "story": [
      "A biologist hid 350 audio monitors across Costa Rica\u2019s tropical rainforests to spy on endangered spider monkeys in order to help protect them",
      "PUERTO JIM\u00c9NEZ, Costa Rica -- The endangered Geoffrey\u2019s spider monkeys that dangle high in the rainforest canopy are elusive and hard for scientists to track.",
      "So biologist Jenna Lawson hid 350 audio monitors in trees across Costa Rica's lush Osa Peninsula to spy on them.",
      "The devices recorded the sounds of the forest and surrounding countryside for a week, collecting so much data that Lawson could have spent years listening to it all.",
      "Instead, she fed it into artificial intelligence systems trained to instantly recognize spider monkey calls and detect where the animals traveled. One of the world\u2019s largest acoustic wildlife studies when Lawson began the project in 2021, it revealed troubling findings about the health of a treasured wildlife refuge.",
      "More of this AI-assisted wildlife surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d as some 28% of all plant and animal species are now at risk of extinction, according to a paper published in the academic journal Science this summer. Researchers from Dutch and Danish universities showed that machine-learning techniques can \u201chandle huge amounts of data and uncover sound patterns, allowing for faster, cheaper, and better ecological studies\u201d that can aid in biodiversity conservation. But many technical challenges remain.",
      "Tech giant Microsoft's philanthropic AI for Good Lab announced this month it is hoping to answer some of those technical challenges with a new kind of hardware and computing system for eavesdropping on the planet's wildest places.",
      "\u201cThose remote places are also the most important places on the Earth from a biodiversity perspective,\u201d said Microsoft's chief data scientist, Juan Lavista Ferres, in an interview last week by video call from Colombia, where a research team was preparing to test the new approach.",
      "Powered by the sun and energy-efficient AI computer chips, the devices can run for years rather than weeks without human intervention. And they can regularly transmit their data online via low-Earth orbit satellites. It's called Sparrow, short for Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation Watch.",
      "Pablo Arbelaez, director of an AI-focused research center at the University of the Andes, said a first Sparrow test will happen in a jungle preserve along Colombia's largest river, the Magdalena. Eventually, the researchers hope to get a better idea of how deforestation \u2014 and efforts to reverse it \u2014 is affecting the population behavior of jaguars, blue-beaked paujil birds, spider monkeys and other endangered species.",
      "Another project closer to Microsoft headquarters will monitor forests in Washington state's Cascade Mountains. By late 2025, Lavista Ferres plans to have devices on all continents, from remote corners of the Amazon rainforest to gorilla habitats of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That will then be \u201copen-sourced\u201d to make it accessible to a wide body of researchers in real time, but with measures to obscure sensitive location data.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is these devices to ever be used for poachers to understand where the animals are,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",
      "It was a concern about encroachments on Costa Rican spider monkey habitat that led Lawson, then at Imperial College London, to undertake her ambitious bio-acoustic study three years ago. She persuaded landowners to let her place recording devices on their properties outside Corcovado National Park, a jewel of Costa Rica's decades-long efforts to preserve biodiversity by encouraging wildlife tourism.",
      "\u201cShe basically realized the spider monkey is in a really critical situation,\u201d said local environmentalist and bug scientist Jim C\u00f3rdoba-Alfaro. On a follow-up visit last year, he and Lawson trekked across a private reserve with an Associated Press reporter to observe the monkeys and check on the audio monitors.",
      "Compared to the charismatic capuchin monkey and the notoriously loud howler monkey -- both commonly seen or heard throughout Costa Rica \u2014 spider monkeys are far more wary of humans and the changes they bring.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re the most sensitive of the primates that we have here,\u201d said Lawson. \u201cThe spider monkey would be the first animal to leave when there\u2019s signs of trouble. They would be the last animal to come back once forests are restored because they need mature secondary and primary forest to be able to survive.\u201d",
      "The Royal Society of London in March 2023 published Lawson's findings of what the audio monitors revealed: the spider monkeys weren't going anywhere near paved roads or the plantations harvesting palm oil and teak wood that bisect the region's protected national parks. That meant government-designated wildlife corridors meant to extend their range through and beyond the Osa Peninsula were not working as well as designed. She came back to present those conclusions to local officials.",
      "After hours of searching, a troop of spider monkeys appeared \u2014 peering down at the humans who found them. Within moments, they were on their way again \u2014 extending their lanky arms and prehensile tails to grasp at trees and propel themselves across the canopy with spidery acrobatics.",
      "Unattended acoustic detection of animal sounds is valuable not just in rainforests but in a wide variety of ecosystems, according to the Science paper published earlier this year. For example, it could help sailors avoid colliding their ships with large baleen whales heard to be passing through a shipping channel.",
      "Lavista Ferres said there are still numerous challenges to overcome, from humidity that can fray jungle monitors to elephants in African savannas unintentionally knocking them off a tree.",
      "Lawson said using the audio monitors to capture the spider monkey's distinctive whinny enables biologists to study a larger area at lower cost, but also provides a truer account of how the monkeys behave without scientists following them around.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re reducing our influence on their behavior,\u201d she said. \u201dAnd also \u2014 they don\u2019t want us here.\"",

    "summary": "In Nigeria, the first part of a $1 billion project to clean up Ogoniland in the Niger Delta, where there have been thousands of oil spills, was a &ldquo;total failure.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "In Nigeria, the first part of a $1 billion project to clean up Ogoniland in the Niger Delta, where there have been thousands of oil spills, was a \u201ctotal failure.\u201d",
      "As it passed above the Niger Delta in 2021, a satellite took an image. It showed acres of land, scraped bare. The site, outside the city of Port Harcourt, was on a cleanup list kept by the United Nations Environment Programme, supposed to be restored to green farmland as the Delta was before thousands of oil spills turned it into a byword for pollution. Instead the land was left a sandy \u201cmoonscape\u201d unusable for farming, according to U.N. documents.",
      "That failed cleanup was not an exception, records obtained by The Associated Press show. Previously unreported investigations, emails, letters to Nigerian ministers and minutes from meetings make clear that senior U.N. officials were increasingly concerned that the Nigerian agency in charge of cleaning up crude oil spills has been a \u201ctotal failure.\u201d",
      "The agency, known as Hyprep, selected cleanup contractors who had no relevant experience, according to a U.N. review. It sent soil samples to laboratories that didn't have the equipment for tests they claimed to perform. Auditors were physically blocked from making sure work had been completed.",
      "A former Nigerian minister of the environment told the AP that the majority of cleanup companies are owned by politicians, and minutes show similar views were shared by U.N. officials.",
      "It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.",
      "There have been thousands of crude oil spills in the tidal mangroves and farmlands of the Niger Delta since oil drilling and production began in the 1950s. Reports and studies document what is widely known here: People often wash, drink, fish and cook in contaminated water.",
      "Spills still occur frequently. The Ogboinbiri community in Bayelsa state suffered its fourth spill in three months in November, harming farm fields, streams and the fish people rely on.",
      "\u201cWe bought the land in 2023; we have not harvested anything from the farmland; both the profit, our interest, everything is gone,\u201d said Timipre Bridget, a farmer in the community. \u201cNo way to survive with our children again.\u201d",
      "Many of the spills are caused by lawbreakers illegally tapping into pipelines to siphon off crude oil they process into gasoline in makeshift refineries.",
      "After a major U.N. survey of spills more than a decade ago, oil companies agreed to create a $1 billion cleanup fund for the worst affected area, Ogoniland, and Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, contributed $300 million. The Nigerian government handled the funds and the U.N. was relegated to an advisory role.",
      "To oversee the work, the government created the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project, or Hyprep. It first addressed sites that were supposed to be easy to clean, like the one outside Port Harcourt. Then it would move on to complex ones, where oil had sunk more deeply into the ground.",
      "But a confidential investigation by U.N. scientists last year found the site outside Port Harcourt was left with a \u201ccomplete absence of topsoil\u201d and almost seven times more petroleum in the subsoil than Nigerian health limits.",
      "The company that performed that work has since had its contract revoked, Nenibarini Zabbey, the current director of Hyprep, who took over last year, told the AP.",
      "The head of operations when the contract was awarded, Philip Shekwolo, called allegations in the U.N. documents \u201cbaseless, mischievous and cheap blackmail.\u201d",
      "Shekwolo, who used to head up oil spill remediation for Shell, said by email he knows more about tackling pollution than any U.N. expert and insists the cleanup has been successful.",
      "But the documents show U.N. officials raising the alarm about Hyprep with Nigerian officials since 2021, when Shekwolo was acting chief.",
      "A January 2022 U.N. review found that of 41 contractors allowed to clean up spill sites, 21 had no relevant experience. Not one was judged competent enough to handle more polluted sites.",
      "They include Nigerian construction companies and general merchants. The websites of two construction firms, for example, Jukok International and Ministaco Nigeria, make no mention of pollution cleanups.",
      "In the minutes of a meeting with U.N. officials and Shell, Hyprep\u2019s own chief of communications, Joseph Kpobari, is shown to have said bad cleanups happen because his agency hired incompetent companies. The U.N. delegation warned that despite their inadequate work, these companies were being rewarded with contracts for tougher sites.",
      "Zabbey denied in an email this admission took place. The cleanup of the simple sites was not a failure, he insisted, because 16 out of 20 had now been certified as clean by Nigerian regulators and many returned to communities. Hyprep always complied with guidelines when issuing contracts, Zabbey said, and their monitors were U.N.-trained.",
      "Two sources close to the cleanup efforts in the Delta, speaking anonymously for fear of loss of business or employment, said test results held up by Hyprep as proof of cleanup could not have been real because when officials visited the laboratories, they found they did not have the equipment to perform those tests.",
      "In a letter to its customers, one laboratory in the U.K. frequently used by Hyprep acknowledged its tests for most of 2022 were flawed and unreliable. The U.K. laboratory accreditation service confirmed the lab\u2019s authorization to carry out the tests was suspended twice.",
      "Zabbey defended the cleanup agency in a statement to the AP, saying it monitors contractors more closely now. Labs adhere to Nigerian and U.N. recommendations and are frequently checked, he said, and the U.N. could have trained local lab staff if it chose to.",
      "The U.N. cited another problem \u2014 contractors were allowed to assess pollution levels at their sites. No government agency was setting a baseline for what needed to be cleaned up at oil-damaged sites. This meant companies were monitoring their own progress, effectively handed a \u201cblank check,\u201d U.N. Senior Project Advisor Iyenemi Kakulu is recorded as having said in minutes of a meeting in June of last year between the U.N., Hyprep and Shell.",
      "The U.N. warned the Nigerian government in an assessment in 2021 that spending at the cleanup agency was not being tracked. Internal auditors were viewed as \u201cthe enemy\u201d and \u201cdemonized for doing their job.\u201d Shekwolo\u2019s predecessor as head of Hyprep blocked new financial controls and \u201cphysically prevented\u201d auditors from seeing if work had been performed properly before paying contractors, according to the U.N. assessment.",
      "Zabbey said this too, has changed since that assessment: The audit team is now valued, he said, and accounts are now audited annually, although he provided only one audit cover letter. In it, the accounting firm asked what steps had been taken to \u201ccorrect the identified weaknesses.\u201d",
      "Shekwolo referred the AP to the office of Nigeria\u2019s president, which did not respond to a request to show how funds are being spent. Environment Minister Iziaq Salako\u2019s office declined an interview.",
      "Sharon Ikeazor was born in Nigeria, educated in Britain, and spent decades as a lawyer before entering politics. In 2019, she was appointed environment minister of Nigeria. She was well aware of Hyprep\u2019s alleged failings and determined to address them.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any proper remediation being done,\u201d she told the AP in a phone interview. \u201cThe companies had no competence whatsoever.\u201d",
      "In February 2022, she received a letter from senior U.N. official Muralee Thummarukudy, with what experts say is unusually strong language in diplomacy. It warned of \u201csignificant opportunities for malpractice within the contract award process,\u201d in the Nigerian oil cleanup work. Ikeazor removed Shekwolo as acting chief of Hyprep the next month, explaining that she believed he was too close to the politicians.",
      "The \u201cmajority\u201d of cleanup companies were owned by politicians, she said. The few competent companies \u201cwouldn\u2019t get the big jobs.\u201d",
      "One of Shekwolo\u2019s roles, Ikeazor said, was to deem who was competent for contract awards. Ikeazor said Shekwolo\u2019s former employer Shell and the U.N. warned her about him, something Shekwolo says he was unaware of.",
      "When she hired a new chief of Hyprep was, she had him review every suspect contract awarded over the years and investigate the cleanup companies.",
      "\u201cThat sent shockwaves around the political class,\u201d said Ikeazor. \u201cThey all had interests.\"",
      "\"That was when the battle started,\u201d she said.",
      "It was a short battle, and she lost. She was replaced as environment minister and Shekwolo was rehired. He had been gone for two months.",
      "Shekwolo says the only politicians he was close to were the two environment ministers he served under. He was never given a reason for his removal, he said, and suggested Ikeazor simply didn\u2019t like him.",
      "Last year, the U.N. Environment Programme broke ties with the Nigerian oil spill agency, explaining its five-year consultancy was over. The last support ended in June.",
      "Ikeazor said the real reason U.N. pulled out was frustration over corruption. The two sources close to the project concurred the U.N. left because it couldn\u2019t continue to be associated with the Nigerian cleanup organization.",
      "Zabbey responded that he believes the U.N. merely changed its goals and moved on.",

      "As many as one-third of people displaced by the August 2023 Maui fires wound up in the homes of friends and family in the weeks after the disaster",
      "WAILUKU, Hawaii -- The Lahaina home Tamara Akiona shared with 10 people was never quiet, and she loved it that way.",
      "Akiona, her husband, uncle, stepdaughter, and her best friend\u2019s family filled the house once owned by her grandparents, with four bedrooms, two living rooms and a spacious backyard.",
      "She remembers the happy anticipation of hearing the front door open and not knowing who'd come home. Someone was always in the kitchen cooking. Neighbors gathered in the evening to chat and share food from their gardens. Kids chased the shave-ice man as he rolled past in his truck.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the stuff I miss,\u201d said Akiona, 51. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have that anymore.\u201d",
      "The home was one of the 1,898 residential structures that burned in the August 2023 Maui fires, which killed at least 102 people and displaced 12,000. Now Akiona and her husband live in a two-bedroom condo in Wailuku, 40 minutes from Lahaina. When they moved, she insisted her uncle, Ron Sambrano, come with them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Lilo and Stitch,\u2019\u201d said Akiona, referring to the Disney movie about family bonds. \u201cNobody\u2019s left behind.\u201d",
      "Estimates say up to one-third of those displaced by the Maui fires wound up in the homes of friends and family in the weeks after the disaster. It was a natural solution on an island already struggling with a housing crisis and where values like generosity and family are deeply rooted. But increasing a household's size overnight can be stressful, and expensive.",
      "The Akionas and families like them received support from a first-of-its-kind disaster-relief program. For one year, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement's Host Housing Support Program gave people who took in displaced loved ones stipends of $500 per person, up to $2,000, each month.",
      "Disaster responders and advocates say it\u2019s a powerful example of how to shape support around survivors' cultural values and preferences, while alleviating the demand for temporary housing and keeping families and communities intact.",
      "\u201cEvery single time we see a megafire we see mass displacement, and the most common displacement we see is that people then double and triple up with relatives and friends, sometimes for a few years even,\u201d said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the disaster-advocacy nonprofit After The Fire. \u201cBut what they never get is actual money to do it.\u201d",
      "Right after the fires, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, or CNHA, quickly learned how many displaced were bunking with friends and family \u2014 to avoid the hotels where 8,000 people were temporarily sheltered, because they couldn\u2019t find an affordable rental, or because they simply preferred it.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s very normal in Hawaii where you lean on your friends and family,\u201d said Kuhio Lewis, CEO of the 23-year-old Oahu nonprofit. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the fabric of Hawaii, it\u2019s this aloha spirit that\u2019s unique to us.\u201d",
      "CNHA recognized that these informal living arrangements would be essential to keeping families housed and decided to make them part of its overall disaster response. It launched a small pilot program in October 2023 that paid households $375 per person for six months. Both host and guest went through a vetting process, including interviews and an in-person home inspection.",
      "With donations from the Hawaii Community Foundation and the American Red Cross, CNHA increased the payment to $500 per person and extended the program to 12 months. The $2.5 million effort supported 672 displaced people staying in 253 households.",
      "The money helped the Akionas pay the new condo HOA fee and gas to commute back to Lahaina. It provided a cushion when Tamara\u2019s work managing a vacation rental slowed and Kawehi, 50, took on a second job valeting cars at a hotel only to fall and break his knee.",
      "Having their own stability made it possible for the Akionas to help Tamara's uncle Ron Sambrano, too.",
      "Sambrano, 60, watched the neighborhood burn that August night. For months after, he would pull his hat over his eyes whenever he had to ride through Lahaina.",
      "\u201cIt was a special place, in less than 24 hours, all that\u2019s wiped out,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s pretty traumatic.\u201d",
      "Living with his niece and nephew has been a comfort. \u201cThey\u2019re doing their best to help me out and just make things work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing. I could be on the street without them.\"",
      "While it\u2019s common for disaster survivors to get financial assistance to stay in hotel rooms or temporary rentals, paying hosts to take in loved ones hadn't been tried in the United States. Doing so can help the entire recovery, said Gray Thompson of After The Fire.",
      "\u201cIt has a lot of benefits people might not understand at first glance,\u201d she said. Placing people in already occupied homes can take pressure off a tight housing market as hundreds or thousands of households seek shelter. It can prevent kids from having to change schools, and puts money back into the local economy by helping families afford to shop for groceries and other needs.",
      "Perhaps most important, host programs can help keep families and communities intact. In the year after the fire, estimates say more than 1,500 Lahaina families left Maui due to a lack of housing and job options.",
      "\u201cWe need people to stay home in Hawaii,\u201d said Lewis. All of CNHA's housing initiatives since the fires \u2014 paying hosts, leasing rentals to families, covering rent, and even building temporary houses \u2014 are aimed at preventing further erosion of the community.",
      "Helping people stay with loved ones had unexpected upsides, too. Of the 6,000 households CNHA has helped since the fires, it found the ones in the host program moved through FEMA and Small Business Administration applications months more quickly than the others.",
      "\u201cThe greatest strength of the program was to allow the survivors time and the ability to heal comfortably, while pursuing the more challenging aspects of disaster recovery,\u201d said Skye Kolealani Razon-Olds, director of resiliency for CNHA's Maui programs.",
      "While the first-of-its-kind program ended in November, Maui isn't the only community still struggling with mass displacement. In North Carolina, 10,000 households were placed in hotel rooms after Hurricane Helene, and half are still there.",
      "When asked if the program could be replicated in other communities, an American Red Cross spokesperson said the group \u201cwill apply the successes and lessons learned for potential use in future responses.\u201d",
      "CNHA is entering its next phase, helping people rebuild and return to Lahaina. It partnered with Maui architects to offer free and reduced design plans and is giving almost 200 families grants of up to $15,000 to cover pre-building costs like permit fees, among other initiatives.",
      "The Akionas want to rebuild their home, eventually. They\u2019re waiting on a lot survey. Water hasn\u2019t been restored to their street. With building costs so expensive, they might wait until they can afford to build a house they want to grow old in.",
      "In the meantime, most of their 11-person household has moved to Wailuku or to Kihei, a 20-minute drive away. \u201cFor the most part we feel like we have our family unit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re as close as we can be now.\u201d",

      "Romanian lawmakers have voted narrowly in favor of a new pro-European coalition government led by incumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian lawmakers on Monday voted narrowly in favor of a new pro-European coalition government led by incumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu.",
      "The move could usher in an end to a protracted political crisis in the European Union country following the annulment of a presidential election by a top court. Parliament approved the new administration in a 240-143 vote in Romania's 466-seat legislature.",
      "The new coalition is made up of the leftist Social Democratic Party, or PSD, the center-right National Liberal Party, PNL, the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party and national minorities. It caps a month-long period of turmoil in which far-right nationalists made significant gains in a Dec. 1 parliamentary election, a week after a first-round presidential race saw the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu emerge as the front-runner.",
      "\u201cIt will not be an easy mandate for the future government,\u201d Ciolacu, whose PSD party topped the polls in the parliamentary election, said in a statement Monday.",
      "\u201cWe are aware that we are in the midst of a deep political crisis,\" he said. \"It is also a crisis of trust, and this coalition aims to regain the trust of citizens, the trust of the people.\u201d",
      "Romani's 16 ministerial positions will be shared among the parties, which will hold a slim majority in the legislature. It's widely seen as a tactical partnership to shut out far-right nationalists whose voices found fertile ground amid high living costs and a sluggish economy.",
      "Ciolacu, who came third in the first-round presidential ballot despite polls indicating he would win the most votes, has served as prime minister since June 2023.",
      "After parliament\u2019s approval, President Klaus Iohannis swore in the new government and warned the new Cabinet that it's entering a \u201cdifficult new period\u201d in which \u201cfor many Romanians, there are major concerns.\u201d",
      "Romania was plunged into turmoil after Georgescu\u2019s surprise success in the presidential race, after allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference emerged. Days before the Dec. 8 runoff, the Constitutional Court made the unprecedented move to annul the presidential race.",
      "\u201cWe go through complicated times, but I think we all learned from mistakes of the past,\u201d Ciolacu said. \u201cI hope that together with my colleagues in the coalition, we\u2019ll find the best solutions to get past the challenges we have in front of us.\u201d",
      "Ciolacu said that the new government would aim to quickly organize the rerun of the presidential election in which the new coalition has agreed to put forward an agreed common pro-European candidate.",
      "Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, said that the new government made up of the same political parties will likely embrace \u201csoft populist\u201d rhetoric such as economic patriotism, anti-austerity, and a peace solution in neighboring Ukraine to counter the rise of far-right populism.",
      "\u201cThis will be a way to answer the concerns of many Romanians who voted for populists \u2026 but will not solve the fundamental problem of trust,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only decisive factor now will be who and how convincing the pro-European candidates will be against this popular revolt.\u201d",
      "George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, which came second in the parliamentary election, said that all lawmakers from his party on Monday would vote against the Ciolacu government.",

      "Japanese automakers Nissan and Honda have announced plans to work toward a merger that would catapult them to a top position in an industry in the midst of tectonic shifts as it transitions away from its reliance on fossil fuels",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan have announced plans to work toward a merger that would form the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales, as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses.",
      "Automakers in Japan have lagged behind their big rivals in electric vehicles and are trying to cut costs and make up for lost time as newcomers like China's BYD and EV market leader Tesla devour market share.",
      "Honda's president, Toshihiro Mibe, said Honda and Nissan will attempt to unify their operations under a joint holding company. Honda will lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company. They aim to have a formal merger agreement by June and to complete the deal and list the holding company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by August 2026, he said.",
      "No dollar value was given and the formal talks are just starting, Mibe said.",
      "There are \u201cpoints that need to be studied and discussed,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly speaking, the possibility of this not being implemented is not zero.\u201d",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan\u2019s Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn was seeking to tie up with Nissan by buying shares from the Japan's company's other alliance partner, Renault SA of France.",
      "Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida said Foxconn had not directly approach his company. He also acknowledged that Nissan's situation was \u201csevere.\u201d",
      "Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker. If they join, the three smaller companies would make about 8 million vehicles. In 2023, Honda made 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.",
      "\u201cWe have come to the realization that in order for both parties to be leaders in this mobility transformation, it is necessary to make a more bold change than a collaboration in specific areas,\u201d Mibe said.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi earlier agreed to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and to jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to electrification.",
      "Nissan has struggled following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Speaking Monday to reporters in Tokyo via a video link, Ghosn derided the planned merger as a \u201cdesperate move.\u201d",
      "From Nissan, Honda could get truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn\u2019t have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybrid powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "But the company said in November that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing its global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "It recently reshuffled its management and Uchida, its chief executive, took a 50% pay cut while acknowledging responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate that if this integration comes to fruition, we will be able to deliver even greater value to a wider customer base,\u201d Uchida said.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan\u2019s credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan\u2019s share price also had fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. On Monday, its Tokyo-traded shares gained 1.6%. They jumped more than 20% after news of the possible merger broke last week.",
      "Honda's shares surged 3.8%. Honda's net profit slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as its sales suffered in China.",
      "The merger reflects an industry-wide trend toward consolidation.",
      "At a routine briefing Monday, Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said he would not comment on details of the automakers' plans, but said Japanese companies need to stay competitive in the fast changing market.",
      "\u201cAs the business environment surrounding the automobile industry largely changes, with competitiveness in storage batteries and software is increasingly important, we expect measures needed to survive international competition will be taken,\" Hayashi said.",

      "The economic and technological rivalry between the U.S. and China has come to the drone market, where Chinese-made flying devices are a dominant player in America",
      "WASHINGTON -- Russell Hedrick, a North Carolina farmer, flies drones to spray fertilizers on his corn, soybean and wheat fields at a fraction of what it would cost him to use a conventional ground spreader.",
      "As a volunteer rescuer, Hedrick uses thermal drones to search for people trapped by mudslides and cargo drones to send water and baby formula to those who are stranded \u2014 something he did after Hurricane Helene.",
      "Now he is fretting that one day he will have to ground his drone fleet. Most commercial drones sold in the United States, including those used by Hedrick, are made in China. They have become a target of U.S. lawmakers, who see the dominance of Chinese drones not only as an espionage threat but as a commercial threat because they make it nearly impossible for American manufacturers to compete.",
      "It\u2019s another front in the U.S.-China economic and technological competition that\u2019s likely to intensify with the return to the White House in January of Republican Donald Trump, who has promised to get tough on China.",
      "Washington has already placed restrictions on Chinese telecommunications companies and imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles as the U.S. competes with China in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and other areas.",
      "A defense bill that Congress passed on Dec. 18 includes a clause to stop two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review finds they pose \u201can unacceptable risk\u201d to American national security. Congress has banned federal agencies from acquiring Chinese drones, with some exceptions, and several states have barred publicly funded programs from using or procuring Chinese drones.",
      "A broader ban is worrisome for Americans for whom drones have become a part of their lives and work. It could disrupt wide-ranging operations, from law enforcement to mapping and filmmaking that drone operators say are viable because of the low cost and high performance of the Chinese drones. American-made drones just aren\u2019t comparable, they say.",
      "In Hickory, North Carolina, Hedrick began flying Chinese-made drones in 2019 to fertilize crops and monitor crop health. A drone spreader costs $35,000, while a conventional ground sprayer would set him back $250,000, he said.",
      "\u201cWith the drone efficiency, we are able to do things we were never able to do before: to apply fertilizer but use less, which is good for American consumers,\u201d Hedrick said.",
      "But it\u2019s precisely that reliance on Chinese drones that worries U.S. lawmakers.",
      "\u201cIt is strategically irresponsible to allow Communist China to be our drone factory,\u201d argued Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has been tapped by Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She led earlier House efforts to ban new Chinese drones.",
      "It was the role of drones in everyday life that drove Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to get Congress to restrict the purchase of Chinese drones by federal agencies. Those restrictions were included in a defense bill that Democratic President Joe Biden signed last year.",
      "Scott has compared Chinese drones to spy balloons that could \u201cgather data or carry harmful payloads\u201d across America, posing risks to military bases, critical infrastructure and natural resources.",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, an advocacy group for unmanned vehicles such as drones, opposes an immediate ban. Instead, his group has urged the government to support the U.S. drone-making industry through investment so it can catch up with its Chinese competitors in both capability and cost.",
      "He applauds Congress for addressing some of the issues in the 2025 defense budget, including promoting investment in autonomous technology and working to develop a secure supply chain for U.S. drone manufacturing.",
      "That vulnerability was clear earlier this year when Beijing sanctioned the U.S. drone maker Skydio, forcing it to ration its batteries sourced from China.",
      "\u201cThis is an attempt to eliminate the leading American drone company and deepen the world\u2019s dependence on Chinese drone suppliers,\u201d wrote Adam Bry, chief executive officer of Skydio.",
      "Citing security interests, China has restricted exports to the U.S. of drone parts, including motors, flight controllers and imaging equipment.",
      "John Goodson, CEO of Darkhive, a San Antonio-based drone maker, said a ban would not stop Chinese drone makers from selling their products elsewhere in the world but could hurt U.S. drone companies that rely on China for parts.",
      "For now, it remains unrealistic to ban Chinese drones when there are few comparable products, said Faine Greenwood, a drone enthusiast who writes extensively about drones. \u201cIf we ban the Chinese drones, we knock out many amazing things we do.\u201d",
      "The best-known Chinese drones are those by DJI Technology Co., a company founded in 2006 and based in the southern city of Shenzhen. It's named in the defense spending bill, along with another Chinese company, Autel Robotics.",
      "DJI has the lion's share of the global drone market and is the dominant player in the U.S. market. Its devices are known for their affordability and high performance. They are even used on the battlefield in Ukraine by both sides, even though DJI does not make military drones.",
      "DJI's drones have been used by first responders to locate disaster victims, mappers to survey roads and utility lines, mosquito control officers to reach swarms of larvae, and filmmakers to capture aerial footage. Police use them to help prevent crime and find missing people.",
      "Hedrick, the North Carolina farmer, mobilized drone search efforts as a volunteer after Helene hit. On the first night, he and his teammates located 150 stranded people. When they could not be immediately rescued, Hedrick said his team used DJI cargo drones to send in supplies.",
      "\u201cI am not going to say I won\u2019t love to have U.S. drones, but I don\u2019t see the American drones as anywhere close to the DJI drones in terms of reliability, ease of use, and just the user-friendly software,\u201d Hedrick said. \u201cThe U.S. drones are not as good as the DJI ones but cost twice as much.\u201d",
      "But as U.S.-China relations have soured, DJI drones have come under scrutiny. The U.S. government has put the company on several blacklists, saying it violates human rights by supplying drones to Chinese police to surveil members of the ethnic Uyghur minority, and alleging links to the Chinese military.",
      "DJI has denied wrongdoing and is suing the Pentagon over the designation that it is a Chinese military company. U.S. customs officials also have blocked some DJI shipments over concerns that the products might have been made with forced labor. DJI has called it \u201ca customs-related misunderstanding.\u201d",
      "As for the defense bill, DIJ said it contains no provision that would allow the company to defend itself. \u201cWe call on a relevant technical intelligence agency to undertake an audit of our products, and we ask for a fair right of reply to any findings,\u201d DJI said.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington said China opposes what it calls the politicization of trade.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government firmly supports Chinese companies in carrying out international trade and cooperation in drones for civilian use, and opposes certain countries\u2019 frequent illegal sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals on the grounds of so-called national security,\u201d Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman, said in a statement.",
      "Several states have already restricted the use of Chinese drones. In Tennessee, public agencies, including police and fire departments, are no longer allowed to purchase DJI drones.",
      "That caused a headache for Capt. Chris Lowe of the Kingsport Fire Department. After his department lost a DJI Mavic Pro drone, he was quoted $5,000 for a replacement from an approved list of drones, when another DJI Mavic Pro would cost $1,000 to $1,500.",
      "\u201cBasically it would be a DJI clone but doesn\u2019t have all the capabilities,\u201d Lowe said of the alternative. Without any state assistance, he said he would either forgo a new drone or tighten the belt in equipment maintenance elsewhere. He said the department has used drones to scope out wildfires, chemical leaks and disaster scenes and to search for missing people. \u201cIt's about life and death,\u201d he said.",
      "In Wimberley, Texas, Gene Robinson has used high-resolution drone images to analyze differences in vegetation to discover buried bodies. He said he helped police find a victim's buried arm, making prosecution possible. Robinson doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a viable alternative to the DJI drone he uses.",
      "He said his project at Texas State University's Forensic Anthropology Center would be \u201cdeader than a doornail\u201d if there's a national ban on Chinese-made drones.",
      "At the Interior Department, the policy against foreign-made drones has hamstrung its drone operations, resulting in the \u201closs of opportunities to collect data on landscape, natural and cultural resources, wildlife and infrastructure,\" according to a September report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",
      "In Florida, law enforcement officers last year complained to the state senate that a ban on state-funded agencies operating Chinese-made drones left them with costlier aircraft that didn't perform as well. That prompted state lawmakers to appropriate $25 million to help government-run drone programs acquire compliant models.",
      "Christopher Todd, executive director of the not-for-profit group Airborne International Response Team, described the ban and the subsequent switch as \u201can absolute mess.\"",
      "\u201cLawmakers failed to understand that this issue is far more complicated than simply changing from one drone to another,\" he said. \u201cYou need to learn a new user interface with new shortcuts and new protocols, and then you need to change all of the software and accessories and re-examine all of your network configurations to accommodate the technology change.\"",
      "But the financial assistance as well as training programs, such as the one provided by his group, made the transition possible, he said.",
      "More than 90% of law enforcement agencies in Florida used DJI drones in 2022, and the share plummeted to about 14% after the ban, according to Todd's group.",
      "In Orange County, where Orlando is located, the sheriff's office said it spent nearly $580,000 to replace 18 noncompliant drones last year and received nearly $400,000 in reimbursements from the state.",
      "\u201cThe transition has gone well and has simultaneously increased our drone fleet with better capabilities and technology,\u201d the sheriff's office said.",

      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump suggested Sunday that his new administration could try to regain control of the Panama Canal that the United States \u201cfoolishly\u201d ceded to its Central American ally, contending that shippers are charged \u201cridiculous\u201d fees to pass through the vital transportation channel linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.",
      "Panama's conservative president Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, who was elected in May on a pro-business platform, roundly rejected that notion as an affront to his country's sovereignty.",
      "The Republican president-elect's comment came during his first major rally since winning the White House on Nov. 5. He also basked in his return to power as a large audience of conservatives cheered along. It was a display of party unity at odds with a just-concluded budget fight on Capitol Hill, where some GOP lawmakers openly defied their leader's demands.",
      "Addressing supporters at Turning Point USA\u2019s AmericaFest in Arizona, Trump pledged that his \u201cdream team Cabinet\u201d would deliver a booming economy, seal U.S. borders and quickly settle wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI can proudly proclaim that the Golden Age of America is upon us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a spirit that we have now that we didn\u2019t have just a short while ago.\u201d",
      "His appearance capped a four-day pep rally that drew more than 20,000 activists and projected an image of Republican cohesion despite the past week's turbulence in Washington with Trump pulling strings from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as Congress worked to avoid a government shutdown heading into the holidays.",
      "House Republicans spiked a bipartisan deal after Trump and Elon Musk, his billionaire ally, expressed their opposition on social media. Budget hawks flouted Trump's demand that they raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, which would have spared some new rounds of the same fight after he takes office on Jan. 20, with Republicans holding narrow control of the House and Senate. The final agreement did not address the issue and there was no shutdown.",
      "Trump, in his remarks in Phoenix, did not mention the congressional drama, though he did reference Musk's growing power. To suggestions that \"President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon,\u201d Trump made clear, \u201cNo, no. That\u2019s not happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not gonna be president,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The president-elect opened the speech by saying that \"we want to try to bring everybody together. We\u2019re going to try. We\u2019re going to really give it a shot.\" Then he suggested Democrats have \u201clost their confidence\u201d and are \u201cbefuddled\u201d after the election but eventually will \u201dcome over to our side because we want to have them.\u201d",
      "Atop a list of grievances \u2014 some old, some new \u2014 was the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re being ripped off at the Panama Canal,\u201d he said, bemoaning that his country \u201dfoolishly gave it away.\u201d",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter.",
      "The canal depends on reservoirs to operate its locks and was heavily affected by 2023 Central American droughts that forced it to substantially reduce the number of daily slots for crossing ships. With fewer ships using the canal each day, administrators also increased the fees that are charged all shippers for reserving a slot.",
      "With weather returning to normal in the later months of this year, transit on the canal has normalized. But price increases are still expected for next year.",
      "Mulino, Panama's president, has been described as a conservative populist who aligns with Trump on many issues. Panama is a strong U.S. ally and the canal is crucial for its economy, generating about one-fifth of that government\u2019s annual revenue.",
      "Still, Trump said, that, once his second term is underway, \"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stand for it,\" Trump said. \"So to the officials of Panama, please be guided accordingly.\u201d",
      "He did not explain how that would be possible.",
      "Shortly after Trump's speech, Mulino released a video declaring that \u201cevery square meter of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to belong\u201d to his country.",
      "Without mentioning Trump by name, Mulino addressed Trump's complaints over rising fees for ships crossing the canal, saying they are set by experts who take into account operational costs, and supply and demand factors.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are not set on a whim\u201d Mulino said. He noted that Panama has expanded the canal over the years to increase ship traffic \u201con its own initiative,\u201d and added that shipping fee increases help pay for improvements.",
      "\u201cPanamanians may have different views on many issues\u201d Mulino said. \u201cBut when it comes to our canal, and our sovereignty, we will all unite under our Panamanian flag.\u201d",
      "Trump then took to his social media site to offer in response, \u201cWe'll see about that!\" He also posted a picture of a U.S. flag planted in the canal zone under the phrase, \u201cWelcome to the United States Canal!\u201d",
      "The canal aside, Trump\u2019s appearance at Turning Point\u2019s annual gathering affirmed the growing influence the group and its founder, Charlie Kirk, have had in the conservative movement. Kirk\u2019s group hired thousands of field organizers across presidential battlegrounds, helping Trump make key gains among infrequent voters and other groups of people that have trended more Democratic in recent decades, including younger voters, Black men and Latino men.",
      "\u201dYou had Turning Point\u2019s grassroots armies,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my victory, it\u2019s your victory.\u201d",
      "Trump on Sunday also announced several new members of his incoming administration, most notably:",
      "-Stephen Miran, who worked at the Treasury Department in Trump's first term, to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, an executive branch agency charged with providing objective economic advice to the president.",
      "\u2014Callista Gingrich to be the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland. Gingrich was U.S. ambassador to the Holy See in Trump's first term. She is married to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",
      "Separately, Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt announced he was donating $1.1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund to complement the $14 million that he said he already had given to the Make America Great Again Inc. super political action committee \u2014 making him one of the president-elect\u2019s top donors.",

      "The New Jersey-based retailer said it will keep more than 95% of its 12,000 employees to help with the process of shutting down.",
      "Party City has faced growing competition from Walmart and Target and increasingly from occasion-based pop-up stores such as Spirit Halloween, which announced in October that it would also open 10 Spirit Christmas stores. That pressure has intensified in an era of rising prices, including for helium used in party balloons, and slowing consumer demand.",
      "The competition has also hit other retailers: Last week, discount chain Big Lots said it would start going-out-of-business sales at its remaining locations after a sale of the company didn\u2019t materialize. Party City's website similarly shows going-out-of-business discounts of up to 50% on the shop's entire assortment goods."

      "Huston, the architect, achieved his goal. The Capitol is a showpiece that draws thousands of visitors every year to where 253 state lawmakers convene to debate and pass legislation.",
      "While the buildings and the clocks are his lasting legacy, Huston was convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the state during the Capitol construction project and spent several months in another Pennsylvania landmark, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.",

He has embraced his role as an ambassador of Judaism in football.",
      "In the NFL, Bates\u2019 story is perhaps one of the most unique in league history.",
      "He grew up about 30 miles northwest of Houston in Tomball, Texas, and played soccer at Central Arkansas before switching sports and transferring twice.",
      "Bates was a kickoff specialist for two seasons at Texas State and for one year at Arkansas, earning All-SEC honors in 2022.",
      "His hometown Texans signed him on Aug. 1, 2023, and waived him 11 days later to send him searching for a new career in the brick business.",
      "\u201cI was still in training, so I hadn\u2019t even sold new bricks yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what I was getting ready to do.\u201d",
      "Bates, though, wasn\u2019t ready to hang up his cleats for good and went to an XFL \u202fshowcase in fall of 2023.",
      "\u201cMy last shot,\u201d he said.",
      "Bates did enough to get signed by the Michigan Panthers and made three field goals from at least 60 yards while playing for them in the United Football League, a team that shares the same home field with the Lions.",
      "Bates believes it was divine intervention.",
      "He has made the most of the opportunity, making game-winning kicks against NFC North rivals\u202f Minnesota \u202fand\u202f Green Bay \u202fas well as Houston. He earned the NFC special teams player of the month honors in November.",
      "While playing football is his job, it is not Bates\u2019 calling.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not here to make kicks or miss kicks,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m here to spread the love of Jesus. So, however long he gives me this stage, that\u2019s what I plan to do.\u201d",

      "The one week of the year where golf tours around the world go silent is always a good time to reflect on some of the tales from the tours",
      "Scottie Scheffler won a lot of tournaments and had to do a lot of talking this year. One theme stood out even as Scheffler was dominating his competition by winning nine times.",
      "The answer could be found on a white board in Paris.",
      "Golfers at the Olympics were asked to write their nicknames, countries, favorite Olympic sports and their goal in Paris. Most of the players said their goal was gold, or at least to win a medal.",
      "Scheffler wrote: Have fun.",
      "He shot 62 in the final round and won the gold medal. That was fun. In fact, from Kapalua in January to being voted PGA Tour player of the year in December, Scheffler used some form of the word \u201cfun\u201d 183 times in news conferences.",
      "It was like that for a lot of people in the world of golf, who created memories that make this year's edition of \u201cTales from the Tour.\u201d",
      "Tommy Fleetwood came to The Sentry on Maui for the first time and brought his father from England. Peter Fleetwood sat in a cart watching his son on the practice range and soaking up the weather in paradise, his first trip to Hawaii.",
      "Being a popular vacation spot, it led to a question about where they used to go to relax.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t take holidays,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford them. We went around to junior golf tournaments in the summer. That was our holidays. And that was good.\u201d",
      "There was a quiet contentment about him as he watched his son, now one of the top players and characters in the sport. The father resumed his thoughts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a great life. I have nothing to complain about,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost my wife a few years ago and I complain about that. But nothing else. I had everything I ever needed.\u201d",
      "The season opener can be a good tone-setter, and it's not always measure by a scorecard.",
      "All the attention on money includes the caddies.",
      "Xander Schauffele and Austin Kaiser were teammates at San Diego State and close friends ever since. Kaiser was working in a warehouse when Schauffele asked if he would caddie for him. They got their PGA Tour card in 2017, the first win, and before long Schauffele was a mainstay among the top 10 in the world ranking.",
      "Kaiser wasn\u2019t doing too bad, either.",
      "The standard fee for many caddies is 10% for a win. With $20 million purses, it adds up. Schauffele was discussing this at Bay Hill when he looked over at Kaiser and told him, \u201cYou get paid too much.\u201d",
      "Kaiser didn't blink.",
      "\u201cYeah, but you're the (expletive) paying me,\u201d he replied.",
      "Both broke out laughing. Some four months later, they had two major championships. Money well spent.",
      "The U.S. Open was approaching and Jack Nicklaus was asked what he thought about the toughest test in golf giving up a pair of 62s the previous year at Los Angeles Country Club. His thoughts instead turned to the course, which he had not seen in some time.",
      "\u201cI played it in 1954, the U.S. Junior. I was 14 years old,\u201d Nicklaus. \u201cI got beat in the second round. I think Hugh Royer Jr. beat me.\u201d",
      "Think about it. This is an 84-year-old who has competed at more than 1,000 tournaments since he was a boy. How can he remember losing 70 years ago to someone named Hugh Royer?",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you,\" Nicklaus added with a smile, \"but I think it was 5-and-3.\u201d",
      "That afternoon came a phone call on another matter to Michael Trostel, the great USGA resource on history. He had a U.S. Junior Amateur record book near him and was asked to look up 1954 at LA Country Club. How did Nicklaus fare?",
      "\u201cLooks like he lost in the second round ... to Hugh Royer Jr.,\u201d Trostel replied.",
      "The score?",
      "\u201cHold on ... 4 and 3,\" he said.",
      "Nicklaus rarely misses, and when he does, it's not by much.",
      "Nelly Korda had high hopes for the U.S. Women\u2019s Open and so did everyone else. She had tied an LPGA record with five straight wins, one of them was a major. She was a big favorite at the biggest tournament in women's golf.",
      "For two holes, anyway.",
      "On her third hole, the par-3 12th at Lancaster, Korda after a long wait hit her 6-iron long into a bunker. She blasted out to a severely sloped green and watched it roll off the front and into a stream. Her next chip from the other side of the stream wasn\u2019t strong enough and went in the water. So did the one after that.",
      "It was a horror show unfolding before her eyes \u2014 and the eyes of her swing coach. Because of the long wait, Jamie Mulligan and had gone up to the grandstands.",
      "After the third ball found the water, Mulligan quietly said, \u201cThis is kind of tough to watch.\u201d",
      "She made 10.",
      "Mulligan, however, didn\u2019t lose his sense of humor, one of the reasons they mesh so well. An acquaintance sitting next to Mulligan found a reason to head back toward the clubhouse.",
      "\u201cI need to find her manager to get more golf balls,\u201d he said.",
      "Steve Stricker accepted the award. His daughter called the shots.",
      "Stricker easily won the Golf Writers Association of America award as the senior player of the year after a blockbuster 2023 season of six wins, three of them majors. It was a festive night at the awards dinner. The only question was whether Stricker would get emotional.",
      "It started when he approached the podium, partly because Gary Woodland got everyone emotional with heartfelt gratitude returning from brain surgery.",
      "Stricker rallied, his voice still a little unsteady, but the message was back on track.",
      "\u201cIf he looks at my mom he\u2019s going to lose it,\u201d his oldest daughter, Bobbi, whispered from her seat in the auditorium.",
      "Stricker spoke of his special year and said he wanted to thank his family. That\u2019s when he turned to look at them and it was over. He went seven full seconds before he could get out another word. Amid the tears, he laughed at himself.",
      "It\u2019s what makes him so endearing to so many.",
      "Justin Thomas made a solid recovery this year, but he couldn\u2019t afford a bad week at the BMW Championship. And he was having a rough week with his putting at Castle Pines.",
      "Thomas was 49th in the key putting statistic going into the third round. He was on the practice green with his father when he mentioned where he ranked and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe there\u2019s someone putting worse than me this week.\u201d",
      "Mike Thomas had to deliver the bad news \u2014 Hideki Matsuyama had withdrawn, and there were only 49 players left in the field.",
      "The good news for Thomas? He made just enough over the weekend to finish 30th place in the FedEx Cup and get back to the Tour Championship.",
      "Scheffler won the gold medal at the Paris Olympics. His caddie, Ted Scott, also received a medal and was never prouder.",
      "Since 2008, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has given American medalists the \u201cOrder of Ikkos\u201d medallion to present to a key member of their team, usually a coach.",
      "For Scheffler, it was an easy choice.",
      "He spoke after the second round about struggling with his attitude and how his caddie helped him. Scott later filled in the details.",
      "It was on the eighth hole, after Scheffler made double bogey from a bad lie in the fairway.",
      "\u201cI called him off the side of the green and I had a stern talking to him,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI just said, 'I want you to look into my eyes, listen to my words and don\u2019t talk back.\u2019\u201d",
      "The message that followed was for Scheffler not to overcomplicate his game or overreact. The mission going forward was to commit to the shot and accept the outcome.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2019You might make everything at the end of the tournament. You don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s see what happens,'\u201d Scott said.",
      "He made everything at the end, a 29 on the back nine won the gold medal. He showered Scott was more praise than usual when it was over.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never had a pro look me in the eyes and say he couldn\u2019t do it without me,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt was special.\u201d",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Gary Player is a big believer that one can't go through life without love. Even at age 89, he's never too old to find it. Player happily shared his big news at the PNC Championship.",
      "He has a new girlfriend.",
      "\u201cI said I wanted to live until 100. Now if I live to 91, I'll be happy,\u201d Player said with a laugh. \u201cIsn't that amazing that at 89 you can find a girlfriend? She loves everything I love \u2014 golf, fishing, gym work, reading, opera, everything.\u201d",
      "Her name is Susan Waterfall, she lives in New York and she's 83. Player's wife, Vivienne, died in 2021. They had been married for 64 years.",
      "Player said he wasn't searching. Friends approached him during a fundraiser at Leopard Creek in South Africa about a woman he should meet. It never happened. He was in New York for a golf course design when someone else brought up her name. Again, they never connected. Then he was invited to be an honorary member for a new golf course in Miami, where memberships go for about $1.3 million.",
      "\u201cI'm on the putting green and this lady comes up and says, \u2018I\u2019m Susan Waterfall. Everyone has been trying to introduce us,'\u201d Player said. \u201cI put my arm around her \u2014 she's gorgeous \u2014 and I said, \u2018I love this country, America, so much. I\u2019ve got to have an American girlfriend.' She blushes, doesn't say anything. So I said, \u2018Will you come to dinner with me?\u2019\u201d",

      "Nelly Korda is celebrating part of Christmas a little early because younger brother Sebastian is headed Down Under for the Australian Open tennis tournament. And then she\u2019s off to the mountains for a little ... dog sledding?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for that, something I\u2019ve never done,\u201d Korda said. \u201cI love the mountains, I love snow and so I\u2019m super excited for that to recharge my batteries. I skied as a kid, but I do not ski now. I\u2019m already fragile enough.\u201d",

      "The made-for-TV match at Shadow Creek brought PGA Tour stars Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy against LIV Golf stars Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka. It was under the lights at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. It was billed as the PGA Tour vs. LIV, just what golf fans wanted.",
      "But according to Sports Business Journal, the 16-hole match (Scheffler and McIlroy won handily) drew only 625,000 viewers across two networks on TNT and TBS on a Tuesday night.",
      "Sports Business Journal said that put it as the second-lowest viewership for \u201cThe Match\u201d series.",
      "One of those viewers was Fred Couples, but not until the fifth hole.",
      "\u201cI did not know it was on,\u201d Couples said. He only realized it when his longtime caddie, Joe LaCava, sent him a text and \u201cI don't even need to say what the text about.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was pitch dark and freezing. Now, I don\u2019t know why they would do that, to play a match that big. ... But I thought it was fun,\u201d Couples said. \u201cI just ... we just didn't get the pitch dark. It was just weird.\u201d",

The Epson Tour has announced a 20-tournament schedule for 2025 that includes three new tournaments and total prize money of $5 million. ... Fred Couples says he has been asked to introduce players on the first tee when the Skins Game returns next year on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Couples was known as \u201cMr. Skins\u201d during the event's peak years. Couples made nearly $4.5 million \u2014 back when $4.5 million meant something \u2014 in 11 appearances. ... The TMRW Golf League that starts next month is going worldwide before a shot has been struck into the monstrous screen in SoFi Center. It has agreements for Canal+ to show matches live in France and sub-Saharan Africa, while Disney+ has secured rights to show them exclusively in the five Nordic countries.

      "Oklahoma City leads the Western Conference and has a MVP candidate in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander",
      "Oklahoma City leads the Western Conference and has a MVP candidate in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Milwaukee has the NBA's leading scorer in Giannis Antetokounmpo. They were the teams that made their way to the NBA Cup final.",
      "By any measure, they're both very good teams.",
      "And neither will play on Christmas Day this year. Bah, humbug.",
      "In its defense, the NBA faces the same challenge every summer, figuring out which 10 teams will get the honor \u2014 and it is an honor \u2014 of playing on Christmas Day.",
      "The Knicks and Lakers almost always find their way onto the slate, which makes sense given the size of the New York and Los Angeles media markets. The teams coming off runs to the NBA Finals typically get a Christmas invite, so hello, Boston and Dallas. The rest is a mix of stars, ratings potential, storylines and, hopefully, good teams.",
      "Victor Wembanyama \u2014 the French star who already is a massive draw both in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 makes his Christmas debut when San Antonio goes to New York. Minnesota plays Dallas in a West finals rematch. Boston plays Philadelphia, a forever rivalry. The Lakers play Golden State, LeBron James vs. Stephen Curry. And Denver plays Phoenix in the nightcap. Nobody could have said those games were Christmas mistakes when the schedule came out.",
      "It's also a sign of the parity in the NBA right now \u2014 there are clearly more than 10 teams worthy of Christmas consideration. That said, the Thunder and Bucks certainly have the right to feel snubbed.",
      "\u201cWe should\u2019ve had a Christmas day game, I believe, but the NBA felt different,\u201d Bucks guard Khris Middleton said on media day, back in September. \u201cThat\u2019s how they feel. I said my opinion on it. And sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "The Thunder not getting picked is puzzling, especially after being the No. 1 seed in the West last season.",
      "This is the 17th consecutive season of the NBA having five games on Christmas Day. More often than not \u2014 75% of the time \u2014 the No. 1 seeds for the East and West playoffs have been picked for a Christmas game the following season. And entering this year, each of the previous 11 No. 1 seeds in the West playoffs wound up having a game on Dec. 25 that same year.",
      "But not the Thunder.",
      "\u201cDisappointed, for sure,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cI'd love to play on Christmas Day. And I think we're that caliber of team. The NBA makes their decisions. Can't slight them for it. Ball's in our court to prove to them why we deserve to be in that game.\u201d",
      "There have been reasons for some of the eight No. 1 seeds who got snubbed in that span to get snubbed. Some examples:",
      "\u2014 Cleveland was the East's No. 1 seed in 2010. LeBron James left Cleveland that summer and went to Miami, and the Cavaliers became a far-less-marketable team overnight so putting them on the Christmas schedule wouldn't have made much sense.",
      "\u2014 Indiana was the East's No. 1 seed in 2014. Paul George got hurt badly while playing for USA Basketball that summer and the Pacers weren't the same the following the season, which the schedule-makers probably realized could happen.",
      "\u2014 Toronto was the East's No. 1 seed in 2018. Toronto didn't make the Christmas list a few months later for the simple reason that the Raptors are from Canada, and Canadian viewers don't count in American television ratings. (The then-reigning NBA champion Raptors made the Christmas lineup in 2019.)",
      "None of those situations would apply to the Thunder.",
      "Oklahoma City is a small market, sure. Only Memphis and New Orleans are smaller among NBA cities in the U.S., according to Nielsen. It's easy to deduce that national ratings play a part in the decision of who plays on Christmas and who doesn't, but it's also clear that those who just want to see good ball on Dec. 25 probably would have tuned in for a Thunder game.",
      "\u201cThey make the schedule. We play it,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cOur players, I know, would have liked to play on Christmas because that's such a staple day in the NBA season. But we can't control that. All we can control is playing the schedule we're given, playing the hand we're dealt.\u201d",

      "Lindsey Vonn thinks her new titanium knee could be the start of a trend in ski racing",
      "ST. MORITZ, Switzerland -- When Lindsey Vonn last raced on the World Cup circuit nearly six years ago, the constant pain in her knee left her in tears and led to retirement.",
      "Flash forward to Vonn\u2019s comeback race on a titanium knee at age 40 last weekend, and the American skiing standout couldn\u2019t have felt more different.",
      "No more pain. No more swelling. No more tears.",
      "\u201cThe last few years of my career were so much different than they are right now. I\u2019m skiing without thinking about my knee, which I really haven\u2019t done since I first tore my ACL in 2013. So it\u2019s been a long time that I felt this good,\u201d Vonn said Saturday after placing 14th in a super-G in St. Moritz. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit older, but honestly I\u2019m a hell of a lot stronger than I once was.\u201d",
      "So much stronger that she\u2019s talking up her knee replacement surgery \u2014 the first of its kind in World Cup skiing \u2014 as a new frontier for the sport.",
      "In April, Vonn had a robot-assisted replacement performed by Martin Roche, a South Florida-based orthopedist specializing in complex knee disorders. Part of the bone in her right knee was cut off and replaced by two titanium pieces. A month later, she was planning her comeback.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot better than my non-existent cartilage,\u201d said Vonn, one of the most successful skiers of all time with 82 World Cup wins. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of skiers already about it and I really think that it could be something that should be considered.",
      "\u201cI feel amazing. I mean, obviously not everyone responds the same way to surgeries. For some reason, I bounce back pretty well from surgery. But I think it\u2019s something to seriously consider for athletes that have a lot of knee problems.\u201d",
      "Andrea Panzeri, the Italian Winter Sports Federation\u2019s head physician and an orthopedist who has operated numerous times on Vonn\u2019s good friend and fellow downhiller, Sofia Goggia, said knee replacements are usually performed on patients older than 50.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely the first time in World Cup history that such a young athlete has raced with one,\" Panzeri told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not aware of any other elite-level athletes in other sports competing with one, either.\u201d",
      "Panzeri performs knee replacements. But he had never even thought about doing one on a World Cup skier \u2014 until he saw Vonn competing with one.",
      "\u201cPartial prosthetics, like the half-knee ones, are definitely the ones that offer the best performance and we\u2019re seeing that (with Vonn),\" Panzeri said. \u201cI don\u2019t think her decision is going to change pro sports. But it could provide more motivation for so-called \u2018normal\u2019 people to try a prosthetic.\"",
      "Three-time Grand Slam tennis champion Andy Murray played with an artificial hip at the end of his career. Vonn\u2019s former skiing teammate Julia Mancuso also redid her hip a few months after she retired in 2018 and maintains an active lifestyle.",
      "\u201cI, for sure, would have considered a comeback if I didn\u2019t have kids,\" Mancuso told The AP recently. \"So I can totally relate to Lindsey.\u201d",
      "But Panzeri said that \u201chips have different biomechanics than a knee and many more people are able to play sports with a hip prosthetic than a knee prosthetic.\"",
      "Elan Goldwaser, a sports medicine physician at Columbia University Medical Center who works with the U.S. Ski Team, has seen many athletes come to his clinic for knee replacements but not elite-level competitors.",
      "So, is Vonn\u2019s operation going to be a trend-setter in skiing?",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the go-to like in baseball with Tommy John surgery,\u201d Goldwaser said in St. Moritz. \u201cBut if it\u2019s necessary, it\u2019s a good procedure to do.\u201d",
      "Chris Knight, Vonn\u2019s personal coach, said they had questions over whether her titanium knee would hold up to the forces required to navigate downhill skiing turns at 80 mph (130 kph) as she hurls herself down steep mountains.",
      "\u201cThere was not a lot of research out there with high-level athletes and partial knee replacements,\" Knight said. \u201cIt is a new frontier. But so far everything\u2019s working really well... And I would not be surprised if other people do it because the results that Lindsey\u2019s had, with no pain and no swelling, have been unbelievable.",
      "\u201cGranted, she stayed in great shape the entire time she hasn\u2019t been racing. So, that probably helped. I mean, if you\u2019re sitting around as a non-active skier and not doing anything with your fitness, then maybe it wouldn\u2019t be as effective. But if you\u2019re an athlete who\u2019s got some knee problems, from what I\u2019m seeing, I wouldn\u2019t be saying no to them.\u201d",
      "Vonn\u2019s new knee also left an impression on U.S. Ski Team head coach Paul Kristofic.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely due for one myself,\u201d Kristofic said. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to her.\"",
      "Still, there are doubters.",
      "Four-time overall World Cup champion Pirmin Zurbriggen told Swiss tabloid Blick last week that \u201cthere is a risk that Vonn will tear her artificial knee to pieces.\u201d",
      "But Panzeri said the titanium does not rupture.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a small prosthetic that doesn\u2019t break.\u201d",
      "Vonn will race next in St. Anton, Austria, Jan. 11-12.",

      "The WNBA now has all of its head coaching spots filled after there were a record seven open positions this offseason.",
      "Dallas named Chris Koclanes as its head coach on Monday and then an hour later Washington hired Sydney Johnson as its new head, rounding out the seven hirings.",
      "There's no common thread among the seven hires as three were former college head coaches (Karl Smesko, Lynne Roberts and Johnson), two were WNBA assistants (Koclanes and Tyler Marsh) and one is an international coach (Rachid Meziane).",
      "Stephanie White is the only former WNBA head coach to get one of the positions as she moved from Connecticut to Indiana.",
      "With the addition of Golden State next season, which hired Natalie Nakase as it's coach, the 13 teams will have seven women in charge and six men.",
      "At the end of the 2022 season, half of the 12 head coaches in the league were Black. Three years later that number is down to three with Seattle's Noelle Quinn the only Black female left after Teresa Weatherspoon (Chicago) and Tanisha Wright (Atlanta) were fired. Nakase is the first Asian American to lead a WNBA franchise.",

      "Here's a look at the eight new coaches in the WNBA:",
      "Smesko comes to the WNBA after spending 23 years at Florida Gulf Coast. He had the third highest winning percentage (.829) among active coaches, trailing only UConn's Geno Auriemma and LSU's Kim Mulkey. His teams have constantly been near the top in the country in 3-point shooting and the Dream have talented players in Rhyne Howard and Allisha Gray.",
      "Marsh heads to the Sky after a successful stint as an assistant coach in Las Vegas, helping the Aces win consecutive championships in 2022 and 2023. Marsh inherits a squad led by talented post players Angel Reese and Kamilla Cardoso. The Sky also have the No. 3 pick in next year\u2019s WNBA draft.",
      "Meziane comes to the WNBA after coaching professionally in France for many years as well as leading Belgium's national team. Belgium came in fourth at the Paris Olympics this past summer. He inherits a team in flux with many of its top players unrestricted free agents.",
      "Koclanes worked with new GM Curt Miller in Connecticut on his staff from 2016-22 and helped the Sun reach the WNBA Finals in 2019 and 2022. Miller was hired as the Wings\u2019 general manager last month. The Wings have the No. 1 pick in the draft next April as well as a strong nucleus headlined by Arike Ogunbowale.",
      "Nakase is the first coach in the expansion franchise's history. She had a lot of success as an assistant in Las Vegas and the franchise got its initial set of players through the expansion draft earlier this month. The Valkyries, who have the No. 5 pick in the draft, also are expected to be active in free agency which begins next month.",
      "White came back to the Fever after leading the Connecticut Sun the last two seasons. She has a stellar young core to work with led by the last two WNBA Rookie of the Year winners, Caitlin Clark and Aliyah Boston. White has decided she has some unfinished business to complete in her second stint as Indiana\u2019s head coach.",
      "Roberts is returning to her native California after spending nine seasons in charge of Utah where she went 165-116. She was the Pac-12 Coach of the Year in 2023. She inherits a team that has a strong young nucleus of Rickea Jackson, Cameron Brink and Dearica Hamby. The Sparks have the No. 2 pick in next year\u2019s WNBA draft.",
      "Johnson has worked with USA Basketball over the past five years as well as being an assistant coach with the Chicago Sky last season. Before that the 50-year-old Princeton grad spent eight years as head coach of Fairfield University men\u2019s team (2011-2019), leading the Stags to four postseason appearances. He inherits a team led by Shakira Austin, Brittney Sykes and Ariel Atkins.",

      "SYDNEY -- There have been plenty of \u201cfirsts\u201d in the history of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race which was first held in 1945. An all-Filipino crew of 15 sailors will make it another when the annual ocean classic begins in Sydney on Thursday.",
      "With veteran sailor Ernesto Echauz at the helm, Centennial 7 will embark on the 628-nautical mile (722 miles, 1,160 kilometers) race. One of six international entrants out of the more than 100-strong fleet, Centennial 7\u2019s crew comprises sailors from the Philippines\u2019 national team and the Philippines navy.",
      "The boat itself is no stranger to the race. Previously, the TP52 yacht was known as Celestial and claimed the Sydney to Hobart overall handicap victory in 2022 under Sam Haynes after being runner-up the year before.",
      "When shipping their own boat from the Philippines proved too difficult, Haynes helped keep the dream alive by selling Celestial to Echauz in September. Haynes will still contest the Sydney-Hobart race on board a new Celestial.",
      "\u201cI never knew that it was going to be this boat,\u201d Echauz told Australian Associated Press. \"We acquired Celestial right away because we were told that it\u2019s ready to do the Sydney to Hobart.",
      "\u201cWe went through the paperwork, and the most important thing is to be able to get the whole crew, 15 Filipinos. They got surprised that, hey, we\u2019re going to bring all of the Filipinos. It\u2019s a dream come true for all of us. We never expected that we\u2019ll be able to join.\u201d",
      "The race takes the yachts down the New South Wales state south coast, across the often notorious Bass Strait and to the island state of Tasmania, ending in the state capital Hobart after sailing the last portion of the race on the Derwent River.",
      ":Last year, LawConnect won line honors i n the 78th edition of the Sydney to Hobart, holding off defending champion Andoo Comanche by less than a minute in an exciting finish between the super maxis. The pair of 100-foot yachts had dueled for much of the race and were well ahead of the rest of the fleet of 103 yachts that started last year\u2019s race.",
      "LawConnect, which was runner-up in the last three editions of the race, finished in 1 day, 19 hours, 3 minutes, 58 seconds. Comanche\u2019s time was 1 day, 19 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds \u2014 a margin of just 51 seconds.",
      "It was the second-closest finish in Sydney to Hobart history after Condor of Bermuda beat Apollo by seven seconds in 1982. Comanche holds the race record of 1 day, 9 hours, 15 minutes, 24 seconds, set when it won the race in 2017.",
      "Echauz\u2019s crew in March finished second by five minutes to rivals Happy Go in a close finish to the China Sea Race, after claiming line honors on board Centennial 5 last year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been sailing with each other for years, for decades,\u201d Echauz said. \u201cThey are dinghy sailors. Eventually, when we started sailing big boats, we would sail together. We\u2019ve been sailing in Hong Kong, which is the sailing center for Asia for big boats, but the standard here is a way, way different. It\u2019s a completely different level.\u201d",
      "The crew placed 12th overall in the Cabbage Tree Island Race near Sydney earlier this month, their first race in Australian waters.",
      "\u201cWe just want to finish it. Just finish well, and hopefully nothing breaks and hopefully nobody gets hurt and we don\u2019t make any mistakes,\u201d Echauz said.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid was ejected in the first half of Monday night's game against San Antonio after drawing two technical fouls.",
      "Referee Jenna Schroeder ejected Embiid with 2:59 left in the second quarter. The seven-time All-Star received the first technical for arguing with Schroeder, and received another technical \u2014 and ejection \u2014 from Schroeder before any more game time elapsed. Embiid was close to Schroeder, but it wasn\u2019t clear from replays whether he made contact with the official.",
      "An enraged Embiid charged toward the officials after the ejection and was restrained by teammate Kyle Lowry, coach Nick Nurse and several assistants.",
      "It has been a trying season for Embiid. He was playing in just his eighth game, missing many due to left knee soreness, three after a suspension for an altercation with a reporter in the locker room and another following a sinus fracture sustained on Dec. 10. Monday's game marked just the fifth time Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia\u2019s Big Three, were in the starting lineup together.",
      "Wearing a mask while playing in just his second game since suffering the sinus fracture, Embiid had nine points and three rebounds in 14:22, shooting 2 for 8. This matchup against Spurs center Victor Wembanyama was a far cry from the first matchup between the 7-footers. Last Jan. 22, Embiid set a Sixers franchise record with 70 points in a 133-123 victory over the Spurs in Philadelphia.",
      "In that game, Embiid made 24 of 41 field goals and 21 of 23 free throws, and added 18 rebounds and five assists. Wembanyama scored 33 points in the first matchup.",
      "On Monday, Embiid went right at Wembanyama in the early going, showing the same aggressiveness as in their initial meeting. However, the Sixers' star looked rusty for most of his abbreviated stay. Just before the ejection, Embiid was whistled for an offensive foul, leading to his altercation with Schroeder.",
      "It was the second ejection of the quarter by Schroeder, although the first was rescinded.",
      "With 8:13 left in the period, Schroeder ejected Philadelphia\u2019s Andre Drummond for an apparent foul on Wembanyama. After video review, however, the officials rescinded the ejection. Then, they initially assessed Wembanyama with a technical foul for flopping. Maxey shot and made a free throw and the point went on the scoreboard, only for the officials to rescind the technical, remove the point and restart the game.",
      "Embiid, a two-time NBA scoring champ, entered averaging 22.3 points, 7.3 rebounds and 4.6 assists. Philadelphia was 2-5 in the seven contests in which he played.",

He pleaded guilty and served 21 months in federal prison before resuming his career in 2009. He retired in 2017 and had been working as an NFL analyst for Fox Sports and as an animal rights activist.",

      "\u201cHis journey is one of resilience and redemption and unwavering commitment to growth,\u201d Webb said.",
      "Vick has no coaching experience and is the latest former NFL star who had not coached before to take the helm of an HBCU program, a club that includes Deion Sanders and Eddie George.",
      "Norfolk State has made only one playoff appearance since moving to FCS in 1997. The last five Spartan head coaches have had losing records, including Dawson Odoms, who was fired in November after going 15-30 in four seasons.",
      "School officials hailed Vick\u2019s hiring as transformational, however. Webb said Vick\u2019s name \u201cresonates around the world.\u201d",
      "Added rector Kim Brown: \u201cToday we turn the corner and we embrace a new season for our football program.\u201d",
      "For his part, Vick said he won\u2019t be outworked, and that he will recruit hard in his home region, long a hotbed of talent. He said he attended Norfolk State games while playing youth football in Newport News and has followed the program over the years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pressure being in your hometown,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always thrived off it.\u201d",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued the NCAA to block the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports, arguing that it tricks and misleads fans.",
      "The lawsuit filed in state district court in Lubbock and announced Sunday, argues the NCAA violates the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act by promoting women's sports that may include a transgender athlete. The law is designed to protect consumers from being misled or tricked into buying products or services that are not as advertised, the lawsuit said.",
      "The Texas lawsuit is the latest attempt by conservative politicians to target transgender athletes and push the NCAA into banning them from competition. President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to stop trans athletes from competing.",
      "The lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop the NCAA from allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports in Texas, or in sports that involve Texas programs. Or it wants the court to require the NCAA to stop marketing events as \u201cwomen's\u201d sports if transgender athletes are allowed.",

      "A federal court last month refused to block the school from playing in the Mountain West Conference championship.",
      "\u201cWhen people watch a women\u2019s volleyball game, for example, they expect to see women playing against other women, not biological males pretending to be something they are not,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cRadical \u2018gender theory\u2019 has no place in college sports.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press is withholding the player\u2019s name because she has not publicly commented on her gender identity and through school officials has declined an interview request.",
      "Paxton accused the NCAA of \u201cintentionally and knowingly jeopardizing the safety and wellbeing of women\" and turning women's sports into \u201cco-ed competitions.\u201d",
      "The NCAA does not track data on transgender athletes among the 544,000 currently competing on 19,000 teams at various levels across the country. NCAA President Charlie Baker testified in Congress earlier this month that he was aware of fewer than 10 active NCAA athletes who identified as transgender.",
      "\u201cCollege sports are the premier stage for women\u2019s sports in America, and while the NCAA does not comment on pending litigation, the Association and its members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women\u2019s sports and ensure fair competition in all NCAA championships,\u201d the NCAA said in a statement Monday.",
      "Brooke Slusser, the San Jose State volleyball co-captain who was among the group of players who sued the Mountain West Conference over her teammate's participation, praised the Texas lawsuit on social media.",

      "The athletes are required to meet their chosen sport\u2019s standard for documented testosterone levels at various points during a season.",
      "In 2022, the NCAA revised the policy in what the organization called an attempt to be aligned with national sports governing bodies. If a governing body does not have a trans athlete policy, then it scales up to the international federation that oversees the sport. If there is no international federation policy, previously established Olympic policy criteria would be followed.",

      "He said last fall that he wanted to play as long as \u201cI don\u2019t embarrass myself\" and believes the Pirates have the pieces in place to return to the postseason, much as they did a decade ago when he was one of the biggest stars in the game.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t been in the playoffs in a while here and it would be nice to do it here,\u201d McCutchen said in September. \u201cWe\u2019re a special group of guys. We\u2019re a special team. It\u2019s there.\u201d",

      "Whelan was out with her boyfriend's family Monday in Duluth, Minnesota, when she saw the owl \u201cjust hanging out there, literally\" after car and bird had collided, she told The Associated Press. The car's owner had already called for help, but the animal rescue organization that the bird needed was closed \u2014 so Whelan stepped in, not for the first time that day.",
      "Earlier Monday, Whelan found an injured great gray owl on the ground further north in Two Harbors, Minnesota. Experts at Wildwoods, a Duluth-based wildlife rehabilitation center, told her how to safely catch the bird.",
      "\u201cI definitely thought that I had had my fix of owls with the first one,\" said Whelan, 22, a Lake Superior Zoo guest experience manager who graduated earlier this year with a biology and environmental science degree.",
      "\u201cI could tell he was having a hard time with one of his eyes,\" she said. \u201cI kind of took my time and just sat there with him and talked quietly and was just kind of trying to coax him to trust me a little bit.\u201d",

      "Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan will attempt to merge and create the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan will attempt to merge and create the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses. Honda will initially lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company.",
      "Following is a quick look at what a combined Honda and Nissan would mean for the companies, and for the auto industry.",
      "The ascent of Chinese automakers is rattling the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers.",
      "Joining forces would help the smaller Japanese automakers add scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota itself has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Nissan has truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "\u201cNissan does have some product segments where Honda doesn\u2019t currently play,\u201d that a merger or partnership could help, said Sam Abuelsamid, a Detroit-area automotive industry analsyt.",
      "While Nissan's electric Leaf and Ariya haven't sold well in the U.S., they're solid vehicles, Fiorani said. \u201cThey haven't been resting on their laurels, and they have been developing this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have new products coming that could provide a good platform for Honda for its next generation.\u201d",
      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle. In American, a vital market for companies like Nissan, Honda and Toyota, that's forcing automakers to consider lower pricing, which will eat further into industry profits.",

      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk\u2019s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta\u2019s Threads and its algorithms",
      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms.",
      "The platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory \u2014 with a user base that has more than doubled since October \u2014 could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms.",
      "But with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites.",
      "The skyrocketing user base \u2014 now surpassing 25 million \u2014 is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October.",
      "Besides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil.",
      "\u201cThey got this spike in attention, they\u2019ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,\u201d said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One\u2019s Council for Responsible Social Media. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have the cash flow, they don\u2019t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.\u201d",
      "To manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature.",
      "Compared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a \u201cquite different\u201d value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience.",
      "\u201cThe first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,\u201d Bluesky said on its blog in March. \u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.\u201d",
      "Because of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players.",
      "\u201cPeople had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cBut the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it\u2019s in other people\u2019s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.\u201d",
      "Little data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies.",
      "Lion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident \u2014 a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers.",
      "\u201cI noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper \u2018Die Ziet,\u2019\u201d he said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cI have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk\u2019s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.\u201d",
      "Cassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead.",
      "There are also signs that foreign disinformation narratives have made their way to Bluesky. The disinformation research group Alethea pointed to one low-traction post sharing a false claim about ABC News that had circulated on Russian Telegram channels.",
      "Copycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he\u2019d initially detected \u2014 a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it.",
      "Bluesky posted earlier this month that it had quadrupled its moderation team to keep up with its growing user base. The company also announced it had introduced a new system to detect impersonation and was working to improve its Community Guidelines to provide more detail on what\u2019s allowed. Because of the way the site is built, users also have the option to subscribe to third-party \u201cLabelers\u201d that outsource content moderation by tagging accounts with warnings and context.",
      "The company didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.",

      "The whistleblower helped train artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT.",
      "Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI engineer and whistleblower who helped train the artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT and later said he believed those practices violated copyright law, has died, according to his parents and San Francisco officials. He was 26.",
      "Balaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before quitting in August. He was well-regarded by colleagues at the San Francisco company, where a co-founder this week called him one of OpenAI's strongest contributors who was essential to developing some of its products.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir\u2019s loved ones during this difficult time,\u201d said a statement from OpenAI.",
      "Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26 in what police said \u201cappeared to be a suicide. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.\u201d The city's chief medical examiner's office confirmed the manner of death to be suicide.",
      "His parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy said they are still seeking answers, describing their son as a \u201chappy, smart and brave young man\u201d who loved to hike and recently returned from a trip with friends.",
      "Balaji grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and first arrived at the fledgling AI research lab for a 2018 summer internship while studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned a few years later to work at OpenAI, where one of his first projects, called WebGPT, helped pave the way for ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cSuchir\u2019s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn\u2019t have succeeded without him,\u201d said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a social media post memorializing Balaji. Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors.",
      "\u201cHe had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,\u201d Schulman wrote. \u201cHe\u2019d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.\u201d",
      "Balaji later shifted to organizing the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4, the fourth generation of OpenAI's flagship large language model and a basis for the company's famous chatbot. It was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and others began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement.",
      "He first raised his concerns with The New York Times, which reported them in an October profile of Balaji.",
      "He later told The Associated Press he would \u201ctry to testify\u201d in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the \u201cmost serious.\u201d Times lawyers named him in a Nov. 18 court filing as someone who might have \u201cunique and relevant documents\u201d supporting allegations of OpenAI's willful copyright infringement.",
      "His records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right to be training on people\u2019s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,\u201d Balaji told the AP in late October. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be able to do that. I don\u2019t think you are able to do that legally.\u201d",
      "He told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations.",
      "But of the \u201cbag of issues\u201d he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was \u201cactually possible to do something about.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said \u201cthey will have to change and it\u2019s a matter of time.\u201d",
      "He had not been deposed and it\u2019s unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death. He also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic.",
      "Schulman, who resigned from OpenAI in August, said he and Balaji coincidentally left on the same day and celebrated with fellow colleagues that night with dinner and drinks at a San Francisco bar. Another of Balaji\u2019s mentors, co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, had left OpenAI several months earlier, which Balaji saw as another impetus to leave.",
      "Schulman said Balaji had told him earlier this year of his plans to leave OpenAI and that Balaji didn't think that better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence \u201cwas right around the corner, like the rest of the company seemed to believe.\u201d The younger engineer expressed interest in getting a doctorate and exploring \u201csome more off-the-beaten path ideas about how to build intelligence,\u201d Schulman said.",
      "Balaji's family said a memorial is being planned for later this month at the India Community Center in Milpitas, California, not far from his hometown of Cupertino.",

      "Amazon workers affiliated with the Teamsters union are holding a strike at seven of the company\u2019s delivery hubs less than a week before Christmas",
      "Amazon workers affiliated with the Teamsters union launched a strike at seven of the company's delivery hubs less than a week before Christmas.",
      "The Teamsters said the workers, who voted to authorize strikes in recent days, joined picket lines on Thursday after Amazon ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations.",
      "The company says it doesn't expect the strike to impact holiday shipments.",
      "Amazon has a couple hundred employees at each delivery station. The Teamsters mainly have focused on organizing delivery drivers, who work for contractors that handle package deliveries for the company. But Amazon has rebuffed demands to come to the negotiating table since it doesn't consider the drivers to be its employees.",
      "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters also says the union represents some Amazon warehouse workers.",
      "Here\u2019s what else you need to know:",
      "The strikes are taking place at three delivery hubs in Southern California, and one each in San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta, Georgia, and Skokie, Illinois, according to the union\u2019s announcement.",
      "The union hasn't said how many workers are participating in the strike, nor how long it will go on. Vinnie Perrone, the president of a local Teamsters union in metro New York, said Thursday that the walkout would continue \u201cas long as it takes.\u201d",
      "The union, which claims to represent 10,000 Amazon workers at 10 facilities, said workers in more locations were prepared to join the fight.",
      "Employees at a company air hub in California have authorized a strike. So have workers at an Amazon warehouse in New York, which unionized with the nascent Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and has since affiliated with the Teamsters.",
      "The Teamsters says its local unions are also putting up picket lines at other Amazon warehouses. A company spokesperson said Thursday the strikers were \u201calmost entirely outsiders, not Amazon employees or partners, and the suggestion otherwise is just another lie from the Teamsters.\u201d",
      "The striking workers are fighting for higher wages, better benefits, and safer work conditions.",
      "The Teamsters have tried to get Amazon to come to the negotiating table since last year, when the labor organization first said it had unionized a group of delivery drivers in California who work for a contractor. Amazon -- which denies it employs the workers -- refused, leading the union to file unfair labor charges against the company at the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "In August, prosecutors at the federal labor agency classified Amazon as a \u201cjoint employer\u201d of subcontracted drivers. In September, the company boosted hourly pay for the drivers amid the growing pressure.",
      "Amazon warehouse workers who voted to union in the New York City borough of Staten Island also have tried to get the company to engage in contract negotiations.",
      "The National Labor Relations Board certified the Amazon Labor Union election, but the company objected to the representation vote and refused to bargain. In the process, Amazon also filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the labor board, which it aaccused of tainting the vote.",
      "Some organizers involved with the unionization effort there have long believed Amazon would not come to the negotiating table unless workers went on strike.",
      "Amazon says it doesn't expect the strike to impact its operations, but a walkout \u2014 especially one that lasts many days \u2014 could delay shipments in some metro areas.",
      "An Amazon spokesperson said Thursday that the company intentionally builds its sites close to where customers are, schedules shipping windows and works with other large carriers, such as UPS, to deliver products.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 05:46:20 -0500",
    "summary": "New discoveries from several archaeological sites in North and South America suggest that ancient people first arrived in the New World much earlier than scientists once thought",
    "story": [
      "New discoveries from several archaeological sites in North and South America suggest that ancient people first arrived in the New World much earlier than scientists once thought",
      "SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Sloths weren\u2019t always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge \u2014 up to 4 tons (3.6 metric tons) \u2014 and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier \u2014 perhaps far earlier \u2014 than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\u201cThere was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly \u2014 what\u2019s called \u2018Pleistocene overkill,\u2019\u201d said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \u201chumans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms \u2014 a bit like the plates of modern armadillos \u2014 that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there\u2019s a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\u201cWe believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\u201d she said. Three similar \u201cpendant\u201d fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table \u2014 those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old \u2014 more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco\u2019s research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \u201cfresh bones\u201d shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas \u2014 and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a big debate,\u201d Pacheco said.",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \u201cWhat I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\u201d she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America \u2014 giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time \u2014 with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% \u2014 many researchers surmised that humans\u2019 arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\u201cIt was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\u201d said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Human Origins Program. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really work so well anymore.\u201d",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods \u2014 including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques \u2014 coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\u201cAnything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\u201d said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \u201cBut really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\u201d",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\u201cWe found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\u201d in \u201cfresh bones\u201d \u2014 meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites \u2014 whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn\u2019t clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\u201cMonte Verde was a shock. You\u2019re here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \u201ccut marks\u201d on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it\u2019s hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\u201d said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \u201cWhy would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to find the oldest anything \u2014 we\u2019ve really just followed the evidence where it leads,\u201d he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans\u2019 arrival in the Americas remains contested \u2014 and may never be known \u2014 it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn\u2019t immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \u201ca giant ground sloth going along on four feet\u201d when it encounters the footprints of a small human who\u2019s recently dashed by. The huge animal \u201cstops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

      "The fate of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet is still unclear after Republican senators spent much of December carefully dodging questions",
      "WASHINGTON -- The fate of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet is still unclear after Republican senators spent much of December carefully dodging questions about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s views on vaccines, accusations of sexual misconduct against Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard's 2017 meeting with then-President Bashar Assad of Syria.",
      "While some GOP senators have indicated they are all-in for Trump\u2019s picks, others have withheld support, for now, especially on some of his more controversial nominees. The dynamic is injecting uncertainty into the process as Republicans prepare to take the Senate majority in January with a four-seat margin and as Trump aggressively challenges them to confirm his Cabinet immediately.",
      "It\u2019s not unusual for senators to wait until after confirmation hearings to publicly announce a decision. But Republicans are under more pressure than usual as Trump and his allies make clear that they will confront senators who don\u2019t fall in line.",
      "\u201cYou only have control of the Senate because of Donald Trump,\u201d the president-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., warned during a media appearance this month. \u201cWithout that, you\u2019d be relegated to insignificance.\u201d",
      "There has been one casualty of the process so far \u2014 former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who withdrew from contention as attorney general after senators relayed private concerns. But Trump has enthusiastically stood by the rest, including Kennedy for secretary of Health and Human Services, Hegseth for secretary of Defense and Gabbard for director of national intelligence.",
      "With hearings starting by mid-January, before Trump is even inaugurated, senators will soon have to decide how closely they will scrutinize the nominees and whether they are willing to vote against any of them. Republicans will have a 53-47 majority, so Trump cannot lose more than three votes on any nomination if Democrats are united in opposition.",
      "The outcome of the confirmation process, and the level of dissent in the Senate, will likely set the tone for Trump\u2019s presidency and his relationship with Congress, which was frequently tumultuous during his first term. He often clashed with the Senate, in particular, but has signaled he expects Republican senators to be more compliant this time around.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about putting yeses on the board, it\u2019s about keeping nos off the board,\u201d said Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, one of Trump\u2019s top allies in the Senate, who speaks with him frequently.",
      "While most Senate Republicans have scrambled to display as much loyalty to Trump as possible, a handful have made clear that they are willing to defend the body\u2019s \u201cadvise and consent\u201d role. Among the senators to watch are moderate Republicans Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and incoming freshman Sen. John Curtis of Utah.",
      "\u201cAnybody who wants to give me heat for doing my job, bring it on,\u201d Curtis said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d when asked about vetting Trump\u2019s nominees. \u201cThis is my job. It\u2019s my constitutional responsibility.\u201d",
      "Still, even moderate senators have shied away from directly criticizing Trump\u2019s picks. And not a single Republican has gone on the record against a nominee.",
      "Several of Trump's picks are expected to sail to confirmation, perhaps even with some Democratic votes. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has indicated he will support Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of State and Rep. Elise Stefanik for United Nations ambassador, as have a few other Democrats.",
      "For the more controversial nominees, though, party unity will be key.",
      "One of Trump\u2019s most embattled picks is Hegseth, a Fox News host and veteran who some see as inexperienced and has publicly questioned whether women should serve in combat. He has also faced allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking that he has denied. But it's all given some senators pause, despite Trump's enthusiastic support.",
      "Hegseth has faced particular pressure from Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, herself a combat veteran who has worked to address sexual assault in the military. She has met with Hegseth several times, and has not yet said she will support him. She will have a chance to question him, publicly and face-to-face, in a Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing that is scheduled for Jan. 14.",
      "Though a hearing for Gabbard has not yet been set, senators will also be able to question her publicly and in a classified setting about her trip to Syria after the U.S had severed diplomatic relations. Gabbard has defended the trip, saying it\u2019s important to open dialogue, but critics hear echoes of Russia-fueled talking points in her commentary. Assad fled to Moscow earlier this month after opposition forces overtook Syria in a surprise attack, ending his family\u2019s five decades of rule.",
      "While Republican senators have mostly refrained from publicly expressing concerns about Gabbard\u2019s ties abroad, nearly 100 former senior U.S. diplomats and intelligence and national security officials have urged Senate leaders to schedule closed-door hearings to allow a full review of the government\u2019s files on her.",
      "Senators have been a bit more openly skeptical of Kennedy, who has long questioned the use of some vaccines.",
      "After a report in the New York Times that one of his advisers filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement saying that \u201cefforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d and that \u201canyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "McConnell, who had polio as a child, is leaving leadership next year but will stay in the Senate. His votes will also be closely watched after years of tension with Trump as he assumes a new role free from the responsibilities of leadership.",
      "Like McConnell, many senators have taken an \u201cadvice\u201d approach, telling the nominees what they need to do to be confirmed.",
      "North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis says he\u2019s told all of the nominees he\u2019s met with so far, \u201cgo out and see what the press is saying about you, find your top 10 and disarm the conversation by having a good solution for why that isn\u2019t you.\u201d",
      "In addition, Tillis said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to have a good showing in committee.\"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll \u201cvigorously pursue\u201d capital punishment after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of most people on federal death row partly to stop Trump from pushing forward their executions",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump promised on Tuesday to \u201cvigorously pursue\u201d capital punishment after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of most people on federal death row partly to stop Trump from pushing forward their executions.",
      "Trump criticized Biden\u2019s decision on Monday to change the sentences of 37 of the 40 condemned people to life in prison without parole, arguing that it was senseless and insulted the families of their victims. Biden said converting their punishments to life imprisonment was consistent with the moratorium imposed on federal executions in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.",
      "\u201cJoe Biden just commuted the Death Sentence on 37 of the worst killers in our Country,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cWhen you hear the acts of each, you won\u2019t believe that he did this. Makes no sense. Relatives and friends are further devastated. They can\u2019t believe this is happening!\u201d",
      "Presidents historically have no involvement in dictating or recommending the punishments that federal prosecutors seek for defendants in criminal cases, though Trump has long sought more direct control over the Justice Department's operations. The president-elect wrote that he would direct the department to pursue the death penalty \u201cas soon as I am inaugurated,\u201d but was vague on what specific actions he may take and said they would be in cases of \u201cviolent rapists, murderers, and monsters.\u201d",
      "He highlighted the cases of two men who were on federal death row for slaying a woman and a girl, had admitted to killing more and had their sentences commuted by Biden.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump often called for expanding the federal death penalty \u2014 including for those who kill police officers, those convicted of drug and human trafficking, and migrants who kill U.S. citizens.",
      "\u201cTrump has been fairly consistent in wanting to sort of say that he thinks the death penalty is an important tool and he wants to use it,\u201d said Douglas Berman, an expert on sentencing at Ohio State University\u2019s law school. \u201cBut whether practically any of that can happen, either under existing law or other laws, is a heavy lift.\u201d",
      "Berman said Trump\u2019s statement at this point seems to be just a response to Biden\u2019s commutation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m inclined to think it\u2019s still in sort of more the rhetoric phase. Just, \u2018don\u2019t worry. The new sheriff is coming. I like the death penalty,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Most Americans have historically supported the death penalty for people convicted of murder, according to decades of annual polling by Gallup, but support has declined over the past few decades. About half of Americans were in favor in an October poll, while roughly 7 in 10 Americans backed capital punishment for murderers in 2007.",
      "Before Biden's commutation, there were 40 federal death row inmates compared with more than 2,000 who have been sentenced to death by states.",
      "\u201cThe reality is all of these crimes are typically handled by the states,\u201d Berman said.",
      "A question is whether the Trump administration would try to take over some state murder cases, such as those related to drug trafficking or smuggling. He could also attempt to take cases from states that have abolished the death penalty.",
      "Berman said Trump's statement, along with some recent actions by states, may present an effort to get the Supreme Court to reconsider a precedent that considers the death penalty disproportionate punishment for rape.",
      "\u201cThat would literally take decades to unfold. It\u2019s not something that is going to happen overnight,\u201d Berman said.",
      "Before one of Trump's rallies on Aug. 20, his prepared remarks released to the media said he would announce he would ask for the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickers. But Trump never delivered the line.",
      "One of the men Trump highlighted on Tuesday was ex-Marine Jorge Avila Torrez, who was sentenced to death for killing a sailor in Virginia and later pleaded guilty to the fatal stabbing of an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old girl in a suburban Chicago park several years before.",
      "The other man, Thomas Steven Sanders, was sentenced to death for the kidnapping and slaying of a 12-year-old girl in Louisiana, days after shooting the girl's mother in a wildlife park in Arizona. Court records show he admitted to both killings.",
      "Some families of victims expressed anger with Biden's decision, but the president had faced pressure from advocacy groups urging him to make it more difficult for Trump to increase the use of capital punishment for federal inmates. The ACLU and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops were some of the groups that applauded the decision.",
      "Biden left three federal inmates to face execution. They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history. _______",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:39:06 -0500",
    "summary": "A House Ethics Committee report found \"substantial evidence\" that former Rep. Matt Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law.",
    "story": [
      "Gaetz had sued the committee to stop the release of the report.",
      "The bipartisan House Ethics Committee on Monday released a scathing report concluding its yearslong investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, finding \"substantial evidence\" that he had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law, and engaged in a broader pattern of paying women for sex.",
      "The report also detailed evidence of illegal drug use, acceptance of improper gifts, granting special favors to personal associates, and obstruction, after Gaetz refused to comply with subpoenas and withheld evidence from the committee.",
      "A woman testified to the committee that Gaetz had sex with her in 2017, when she was 17 and had just completed her junior year of high school, and Gaetz was in his first year in Congress. Identified only as \"Victim A\" in the report, the woman told investigators she received $400 in cash from the then-congressman that evening, \"which she understood to be payment for sex,\" according to the report.",
      "\"The Committee received credible testimony from Victim A herself, as well as multiple individuals corroborating the allegation,\" the report says. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "While many of the allegations in the committee's report have been previously reported, this is the first time the woman's direct testimony about Gaetz having sex with her when she was a minor has been made public, along with corroborating testimony from others.",
      "Investigators noted that while the former Florida congressman has \"suggested that the allegations against him have been manufactured\" and had called into question Victim A's credibility, \"the Committee found no reason to doubt the credibility of Victim A.\"",
      "The report details that between 2017-2020, records obtained by the committee show Gaetz paid nearly $100,000 dollars to 12 different women and to Joel Greenberg, his one-time close friend who in 2021 pleaded guilty to numerous crimes, including sex trafficking Victim A.",
      "While all the women who testified to the committee described their sexual encounters with Gaetz as consensual, according to the report, one woman raised concerns that drug use at the parties and events may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\" Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report alleges that Gaetz \"took advantage of the economic vulnerability of young women to lure them into sexual activity for which they received an average of a few hundred dollars after each encounter.\"",
      "\"Such behavior is not 'generosity to ex-girlfriends,' and it does not reflect creditably upon the House,\" the report reads, referencing the former congressman's previous statement dismissing the allegations as someone \"trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.\"",
      "\"Based on the above, the Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the report says.",
      "Following the release of the report, Gaetz shared on X what appears to be a message he received from President-elect Donald Trump, though it is unclear when the message was sent.",
      "\"I got a great note from President Trump!\" Gaetz wrote alongside a photograph showing what appears to be a brief message from Trump, saying, \"Matt very unfair!\"",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The Justice Department declined to charge him last year after a yearslong investigation into similar allegations.",
      "Last month, Trump tapped Gaetz to serve as attorney general in the incoming administration, and Gaetz resigned his congressional seat shortly after. Gaetz subsequently withdrew his name from consideration for AG, saying his confirmation process was \"unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\"",
      "The Ethics Committee was in the final stages of its probe into Gaetz when Trump tapped him for attorney general. The committee generally drops investigations of members if they leave office, but Gaetz's resignation prompted a fiery debate on Capitol Hill over whether the panel should release its report to allow the Senate to perform its role of vetting presidential nominations.",
      "Following indications last week that the committee would release its report, Gaetz took to X in a lengthy post, writing in part that when he was single he \"often sent funds to women\" he dated and that he \"never had sexual contact with someone under 18.\"",
      "\"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now,\" he posted. \"I've never been charged. I've never been sued. Instead, House Ethics will reportedly post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\"",
      "In its report, the committee concluded that it did not find substantial evidence that Gaetz violated federal sex trafficking laws, finding that while Gaetz \"did cause the transportation of women across state lines for purposes of commercial sex,\" investigators did not find evidence \"that any of those women were under 18 at the time of travel, nor did the Committee find sufficient evidence to conclude that the commercial sex acts were induced by force, fraud, or coercion.\"",
      "According to the report, the committee conducted over two dozen interviews, issued 29 subpoenas, reviewed nearly 14,000 documents, and requested information from multiple government agencies as part of its extensive investigation into the allegations.",
      "The committee received written testimony from Greenberg but, due to credibility concerns, investigators said they would \"not rely exclusively on information provided by Mr. Greenberg,\" according to the report.",
      "The committee also accused Gaetz of obstructing its investigation by ignoring subpoenas, withholding documents, and declining to answer questions about the allegations.",
      "\"Representative Gaetz continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed,\" the report reads. \"His actions undermine not only his claims that he had exculpatory information to provide, but also his claims that he intended to cooperate with the Committee in good faith. It is apparent that Representative Gaetz's assertions were nothing more than attempts to delay the Committee's investigation.\"",
      "The committee had been investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift, according to sources.",
      "Earlier this year, the committee released a statement that it would continue its probe but would no longer pursue allegations that Gaetz \"may have shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe or improper gratuity.\"",
      "According to the report, while several committee members did not support its release, a majority of its members voted in favor of its release on Dec. 10. In a statement at the conclusion of the report, House Ethics Chairman Michael Guest reiterated his stance against the release of the report on behalf of the dissenting members while acknowledging that he and other members do not dispute the report's findings.",
      "\"We believe and remain steadfast in the position that the House Committee on Ethics lost jurisdiction to release to the public any substantive work product regarding Mr. Gaetz after his resignation from the House on November 14, 2024,\" Guest wrote.",
      "Earlier Monday Gaetz filed a lawsuit against the Ethics Committee in an effort to stop the committee from releasing its report.",
      "\"This action challenges the Committee's unconstitutional and ultra vires attempt to exercise jurisdiction over a private citizen through the threatened release of an investigative report containing potentially defamatory allegations,\" the filing from Gaetz said.",
      "Gaetz in the filing asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to block the release of the report or any findings, which he says would cause \"damage to his reputation and professional standing\" that would be \"immediate and severe.\"",
      "\"The threatened release of information believed to be defamatory by a Congressional committee concerning matters of sexual propriety and other acts of alleged moral turpitude constitutes irreparable harm that cannot be adequately remedied through monetary damages,\" the filing stated.",
      "\"After Plaintiff's resignation from Congress, Defendants improperly continued to act on its investigation, and apparently voted to publicly release reports and/or investigative materials related to Plaintiff without proper notice or disclosure to Plaintiff,\" the complaint said.",
      "Following the report's release Monday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta gave Gaetz until 5 p.m. ET to show why the suit shouldn't be dismissed with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction, given \"this case appears to be moot in light of the House Ethics Committee's public disclosure of the report.\"",
      "In a subsequent filing, attorneys for Gaetz acknowledged that their lawsuit is now \"mooted\" following the release of the report -- a move they said has caused Gaetz \"irreversible and irreparable harm.\"",
      "The filing said the committee's decision to release the report was \"unprecedented and procedurally defective,\" and reiterated their claim that it was released without notifying him.",

    "summary": "Congress members urged President Joe Biden to exonerate civil rights leader Marcus Garvey.",
    "story": [
      "J. Edgar Hoover allegedly targeted Garvey over a century ago.",
      "A group of 21 House Democrats signed a letter urging the president to exonerate former civil rights leader Marcus Garvey, according to a statement sent by the lawmakers to ABC News on Monday.",
      "Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY) led the panel of lawmakers -- mostly from the Congressional Black Caucus -- to exonerate Garvey on the heels of President Joe Biden's commutation of 37 sentences from federal death row on Monday.",
      "Garvey, one of the earliest internationally-known Black civil rights leaders, was convicted of mail fraud in 1923 and was given a five-year sentence, according to a letter sent to Biden from the Congress members, obtained by ABC News. President Calvin Coolidge pardoned Garvey two years into his sentence. Garvey was immediately deported to his birth country of Jamaica.",
      "\"Exonerating Mr. Garvey would honor his work for the Black community, remove the shadow of an unjust conviction, and further this administration's promise to advance racial justice,\" the lawmakers said in the letter to the president. \"At a time when Black history faces the existential threat of erasure by radical state legislatures, a presidential pardon for Mr. Garvey would correct the historical record and restore the legacy of an American hero.\"",
      "Congress members have been trying for decades to clear Garvey's name, according to the congress members. Congressman John Conyers led hearings in 1987 for the House Judiciary Committee on Garvey's exoneration. Congressman Charles Rangel introduced resolutions, highlighting alleged injustices against the former civil rights leader in 2004.",
      "\"Exactly 101 years ago, Mr. Garvey was convicted of mail fraud in a case that was marred by prosecutorial and governmental misconduct,\" The congress members said in the letter. \"The evidence paints an abundantly clear narrative that the charges against Mr. Garvey were not only fabricated but also targeted to criminalize, discredit, and silence him as a civil rights leader.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately reply to ABC News' request for a response.",
      "Garvey, who was born in Jamaica in 1887, was a notable Pan-Africanist, believing that people of African descent around the world should be unified because of their alleged common interests.",
      "Garvey was the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) which was created to challenge racial inequality, according to the lawmakers. The organization championed self-determination and economic independence for Black people at a time when Jim Crow laws oppressed African Americans and colonization subjugated Africans on their own continent.",
      "Garvey also established the Black Star Line, one of the first Black-owned shipping companies in the Western Hemisphere, connecting Black businesses across the Americas, according to the lawmakers. The civil rights leader eventually wanted to route the vessels to Africa for a redemption program, according to the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. He wanted to establish a nation for those who were born into slavery or were the descendants of enslaved people, according to The Washington Post.",
      "Garvey also created the Negro World Newspaper which, at its peak, reached a circulation of 200,000 readers weekly, according to the congressmembers.",
      "Garvey shared the segregationist views of the Ku Klux Klan as he sought a separate state for those of the African diaspora, according to The Washington Post.",
      "\"I regard the Klan the Anglo Saxon clubs and white American societies as far as the Negro is concerned, as better friends of the race than all other groups of hypocritical whites put together,\" Garvey said according to The New York Times.",
      "Other Black civil rights activists were outraged. W. E. B. Du Bois said Garvey was the most dangerous enemy of the Negro race and was either \"a lunatic or a traitor,\" according to PBS. Du Bois also said Garvey \"suffered from serious defects of temperament and training.\"",
      "The newly formed Bureau of Investigation, later becoming the FBI, and the director of its intelligence division, a-young J. Edgar Hoover, brought mail fraud proceedings against Garvey in connection to the sale of Black Star Line shipping stock, according to The Washington Post. He was sentenced to five years in prison and served two years before his pardon and eventual deportation by Coolidge.",
      "The FBI declined ABC News' request for a comment.",
      "Garvey never returned to the U.S. again, according to the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.",
      "\"As we approach the conclusion of your administration, this moment provides a chance to leave an indelible mark on history,\" the lawmakers told Biden in their letter.",

      "Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede flatly rejected the idea, posting a statement on Facebook, that according to translation says: \"Greenland is ours We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our year-long struggle for freedom. However, we must continue to be open to cooperation and trade with the whole world, especially with our neighbours.\"",
      "Trump similarly expressed an interest in trying to purchase Greenland during his first administration.",
      "Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark, which has sovereignty over the self-governing island, at the time pushed back that the idea was \"absurd.\"",
      "Frederiksen was reelected in 2022. The Danish prime minister's office, in a statement to ABC News, said the \"Danish Government is looking forward to welcoming the new American ambassador. And the Government is looking forward to working with the new administration.\"",
      "\"In a complex security political situation as the one we currently experience, transatlantic cooperation is crucial,\" the office said. \"As far as statements about Greenland, the Prime Minister's Office has no comments other than reference to what was stated by the Premier of Greenland about Greenland not being for sale, but open for cooperation.\"",
      "The first Trump administration gave Greenland $12 million for economic development, part of which was to help develop energy and natural resources. The U.S. also opened a consulate in Greenland for the first time in decades during Trump's previous presidency.",
      "The U.S. also operates Pituffik Space Base, the Defense Department's northernmost base, on Greenland's coast.",
      "Greenland is rich in valuable minerals, including rare earth metals, precious metals, precious stones, coal, graphite, and uranium, but its geography and climate makes commercially viable mining challenging, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Association. Its rare earth resources would rank in the top five worldwide if developed, the ITA reported.",
      "Previous Trump administration officials pointed to Greenland, the world's largest island, as a key interest as China and Russia ramped up activity in the Arctic.",
      "Howery, who previously served as U.S. ambassador to Sweden during the first Trump administration, said he was \"humbled\" by Trump tapping him to be the top U.S. diplomat in Greenland.",
      "\"Representing our great nation abroad is a profound responsibility. I know first-hand the power of diplomacy to advance American interests and strengthen alliances, and I am grateful for the opportunity to return to Europe to promote the President's agenda,\" Howery said in a statement posted to social media.",
      "Howery's statement did not address Trump's suggestion that American ownership of Greenland was an \"absolute necessity.\"",
      "\"I look forward to working with the dedicated teams at U.S. Embassy Copenhagen and U.S. Consulate Nuuk in Greenland to deepen the bonds between our countries,\" Howery said."

      "Trump celebrates election results and looks ahead to delivering on promises.",
      "In his first rally-style speech since winning the 2024 election, President-elect Donald Trump raved about his election victory for nearly 10 minutes before transitioning to confidence that he would deliver on his administration's promises, as well as touting his Cabinet selections.",
      "Trump spoke at AmericaFest, a political festival for conservatives put on by Turning Point, the conservative organization run by Charlie Kirk that was instrumental in helping Trump garner support among younger voters through its get out the vote initiatives in battleground states.",
      "Trump's speech was essentially many of the proposals he has already released on his Truth Social social media platform, including his threats on tariffs and taking back the Panama Canal, as well as bragging about the amount of people that have reached out to him since his victory.",
      "He said his remarks were \u201cjust a small preview of the common sense revolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause that's what I call it, a common sense revolution that's coming soon to America, to a theater near you, right? But it's coming to you through your president, Donald J. Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "Throughout his 75-minute remarks, Trump made no mention of the recently passed government funding bill, which did not include his last-minute demand to raise the debt ceiling or eliminate it. After vocally opposing the original bill, Trump has yet to make any comments on the legislation that passed early Saturday.",
      "However, speakers ahead of Trump had something to say on the issue. Trump's allies called for Speaker Mike Johnson to lose his speakership role over working with Democrats, called for the Republican lawmakers who voted against the package to be primaried, along with threats to Republican senators who were on the fence about confirming some of Trump's Cabinet picks.",
      "\"Johnson's not up to the task. He's got to go, right? He's got to go. Should Johnson be speaker of the House?\" Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser who served time in jail for contempt of Congress, asked the crowd, which responded with a resounding \"No.\"",
      "\"We don't need partisanship now. We need hyperpartisanship now. The conversation is over. We have nothing else to discuss. It's only about the execution of President Trump's plan,\" he added.",
      "However, when Trump took the stage, he spent most of his time touting his transition efforts.",
      "\"We have accomplished so much in just 47 days since the election. But that's only the beginning of what we will achieve together as the 47th president of the United States of America,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump said his second administration would \"turn the page\" on what he called four failed years under the Biden administration.",
      "\"I campaigned on an agenda of delivering profound change to Washington, and last month, the American people voted for change like they've never voted before, and in overwhelming numbers, numbers that nobody saw coming. I saw them coming because I think we all saw coming,\" Trump said.",
      "As tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has become more vocal about the future of the country, including a series of tweets criticizing the government funding bill, many lawmakers and pundits have started quipping that Musk is actually running the country. Trump laughed about the idea on Sunday, calling it the new \"hoax\" from the media and saying he likes to have smart people around him.",
      "\"And no, he's not taking the presidency. I love having smart people\u2026No, no, that's that happening. But Elon's done an amazing job. Isn't it nice to have smart people that we could rely on?\" Trump quipped, celebrating Musk's role with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Trump applauded Musk for his campaign contributions in Pennsylvania, helping North Carolinians during hurricane relief by providing Starlink, and his endeavors with SpaceX.",
      "\"No he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,\" Trump repeated. \"I'm safe. You know why? He wasn't born in this country. Ha, Ha.\"",
      "Trump spent time praising several of his embattled Cabinet picks, including his defense secretary selection Pete Hegseth, saying he thinks he will do \"great\" in the role.",
      "\"Over the past few weeks, I've nominated an all star Cabinet of some of the most determined and brilliant individuals ever to step forward for public office, and we're getting great reviews I have to say, they're all doing well, but we're getting fantastic reviews on the people that we chose,\" Trump said.",
      "He again shared misinformation about vaccines being linked to a rise in autism and said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, would be in charge of investigating it.",
      "\"Think of this, 25 years ago, autism, one in 10,000 children today is one in 36 children. Is something wrong? I think so,\" he said. \"And Robert and I and all, we're going to figure it out\u2026\"",
      "Trump provided a one-sentence remark on Tulsi Gabbard, his choice for director of national intelligence, mentioning her nomination without any additional commentary. He added that he thinks Kash Patel, his selection to lead the FBI, \"may be the greatest director of them all.\"",
      "While Trump was going through his Day 1 priorities, he highlighted Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments in which he said he is ready to speak with the president-elect.",
      "\"President Putin said that he wants to meet with me as soon as possible. So we have to wait for this. But we have to end that war. That war is a horrible...\" Trump said, appearing to allude to public comments Putin made on Thursday.",
      "Trump also reiterated his tariff threat against Canada, Mexico, and China if they don't \"step up and stop the illegal aliens and illegal drugs from pouring into our country.\"",
      "\"They can't treat us that way. They're not going to be treating us that way for long that, I can tell you, because we're not going to let them turn the United States into a dumping ground.\"",
      "Trump also doubled down on his threat to take back the Panama Canal, complaining about the fees being charged to the U.S. Navy and American businesses: \"This complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop. It's going to stop,\" he said.",
      "As Trump spent the last couple months of his campaign emphasizing anti-transgender rhetoric, he said he will sign executive orders on Day 1 to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender people out of the military, and keep \"men out of women's sports.\"",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female. Later, Trump railed against the \"woke,\" calling wokeness \"bull----.\"",
      "While emphasizing his tariff threat, Trump also once again talked about migrants by labeling them as violent criminals, going on to assert that he would designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, which he attempted to implement during his first term but halted after Mexico's president at the time urged him not to.",
      "\"Every foreign gang member will be expelled, and I will immediately designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. We're going to do it immediately. And we'll unleash the full power of federal law enforcement.\"",
      "Trump also vowed that his immigration policies would include a robust campaign on the flow of fentanyl into America and its devastating effects.",
      "\u201cWe're going to show what these drugs are doing to you. Nobody's done that before, and we're going to do it.\u201d",
      "One of his Day 1 priorities, he said, will be a \"historic slate of executive orders to close our border to illegal aliens and stop the invasion of our country.\"",
      "\"And on that same day, we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than that of President Dwight Eisenhower,\" he said, calling it \"Operation Aurora,\" after the Colorado city that he referred to often on the campaign trail where he said immigrant gangs had taken over apartment buildings.",
      "While touting his victory, Trump also expressed gratitude to Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA executive director, who led some of the largest pro-Trump ground efforts among younger voters.",
      "\"I want to express my tremendous gratitude to Charlie Kirk. He's really an amazing guy, amazing guy and his whole staff for their relentless efforts to achieve this very historic victory\u2026 It's not my victory, it's your victory. It's a great honor.\"",
      "Trump continued his victory lap, going on to praise the demographic shifts that happened towards Republicans while promising to unite the country. He also went on a tangent about the reach he was able to have through TikTok.",
      "\"Tiktok, and we had a great response with billions of views, billions and billions of views,\" he said. \"They brought me a they brought me a chart, and it was a record, and it was so beautiful to see. And as I looked at it, I said, 'Maybe we got to keep this sucker around a little while.'\"",

      "\"I've been warning people, like, 'You got to chill out,' you know? Like the constant, you know, freakout, it's not helpful,\" Fetterman said. \"Pack a lunch, pace yourself, because he hasn't even taken office yet.\"",
      "Asked by Karl what the single biggest factor was behind Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in November, Fetterman pointed to the \"undeniable\" and \"singular political talent\" of Trump.",
      "\"He had the energy and almost a sense of fearlessness to just say all those kinds of things,\" Fetterman said. \"You literally were shot in your head and had the presence of mind to respond, you know, 'Fight, fight, fight!' I mean, that's a political talent.\"",

Harris said in an October town hall that she believed Trump was a fascist after Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly said that his old boss fit the definition of one. Fetterman said that was not a word he would use.",
      "\"Fascism, that's not a word that regular people, you know, use, you know?\" Fetterman said. \"I think people are going to decide who is the candidate that's going to protect and project, you know, my version of the American way of life, and that's what happened.\"",
      "Fetterman also pointed to Elon Musk's endorsement of Trump as another key factor in the election.",
      "\"It's rare to have a surrogate that has a lot of fanboys and is very compelling to a lot of the demographic that we are losing in my party and in Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman said about the billionaire businessman.",
      "Fetterman said Musk's endorsement \"really mattered\" and he believed it did \"move the needle.\"",
      "Fetterman was the first Democrat in the Senate to meet with Pete Hegseth, the controversial former Fox News anchor who Trump selected for defense secretary. Fetterman has not ruled out supporting him -- or any of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"My commitment, and I think I'm doing the job, is I'm going to sit down and have a conversation,\" Fetterman said. \"To me, it would be distressing if, if he is confirmed, if the Democrats are going to turn our back collectively to the leader of the defense. I mean, that's astonishing and that's dangerous.\"",
      "Along with Hegseth, Fetterman has met with Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, and Kash Patel, Trump's selection for FBI director.",
      "Patel's vow to take on Trump's political enemies has drawn scrutiny. Asked by Karl whether he thinks Patel will use the FBI to do so, Fetterman said while he wasn't able to go into detail due to the off-the-record nature of the meeting, \"That's never going to happen.\"",
      "\"So you see yourself inclined to be open to supporting these controversial nominees?\" Karl asked.",
      "\"Potentially,\" Fetterman replied. \"But nobody can accuse me of just saying I had a closed mind, or I just said no because Trump picked this person, or whatever.\"",
      "Fetterman has said he will vote to confirm Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He said he will also back Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio, for me, it's like, he's in the other party, obviously, but you know, there's a lot of, the Venn [diagram] is closer, there's a lot of overlap,\" Fetterman said. \"If I was, as a Democrat, looking to assemble a bipartisan cabinet, he'd be a solid choice.\"",
      "Asked what his message to Trump would be if the president-elect called him, Fetterman said he'd like to talk about opportunities where \"we could work together.\"",
      "\"I'd like to avoid the, you know, the cheap heat and some of the other stuff, but it's going to be a kooky ride, I'm sure,\" he said. \"And you know, I try to be a committed, steady voice for Pennsylvania and to remember that we have to find as many wins in the middle of incredibly divisive times.\"",

      "On Jan. 20, 2025 \u2014 28 days from today \u2014 President Joe Biden will leave office after just one term. That got us thinking ... What have been the biggest news stories of the last four years? What will Biden's presidency be remembered for, and will those memories be good or bad ones? So for the final 538 Slack chat of 2024, I've assembled an all-star panel of reporters and political scientists to discuss what Biden's legacy will be.",
      "Now, I want to acknowledge up front that this is a premature exercise: Ideally, you need distance \u2014 and a knowledge of how things played out after they left office \u2014 to properly assess a presidency, and historians are constantly reevaluating their perceptions of even long-dead presidents based on evolving sensibilities.",

So, based on what we know today, if you guys had to pick one moment/episode/trend/accomplishment/failure from Biden's presidency that will go down in history, what would it be? Let's start with you, Geoffrey.",

And because Trump went on to win this election, Biden's choice to seek reelection will undoubtedly be a chief focus of his presidency, even though we'll have to wait to see how other aspects of his presidency will be remembered.",
      "Biden decided to run again despite concerns about his age, and then his debate showing substantially reinforced the doubts many voters already had. Biden stepped aside for Vice President Kamala Harris in late July, becoming the first presumptive presidential nominee in the modern primary era to drop a reelection bid. This left his vice president about three months to campaign for the office, a race she narrowly lost.",

It's difficult to say how things might've played out differently, of course \u2014 counterfactuals always are. But had Biden decided to bow out way back in late 2022, perhaps a different candidate who won a contested Democratic presidential primary would have defeated Trump.",
      "Monica Potts (Monica Potts, senior politics reporter): I agree, Geoffrey, and I thought you'd choose the debate. I do think it will be remembered as a turning point, and for causing an extremely rare event in the modern era: a nominee leaving the presidential race so late in the cycle and essentially anointing his vice president without a primary.",

      "julia_azari (Julia Azari, professor of political science at Marquette University and 538 contributor): Sorry, got distracted by the end-of-year recipes.",
      "This definitely makes sense to me, but I also think that as we get further from the 2024 election, this may fade from memory. People don't exactly remember former President Lyndon B. Johnson's decision to drop out of the 1968 election as his main legacy, for example, but they do remember the broader circumstances: domestic unrest and the Vietnam War. It's hard to think of an example of an election that became a president's main legacy.",
      "nrakich: That's an interesting point, Julia. I feel like Johnson's withdrawal from the 1968 campaign is something that history will never forget ... but, to your point, I'm not sure it's really legacy-defining.",
      "What would be the equivalent of those broader circumstances for Biden? His age? I could see a big part of his legacy being a cautionary tale for Americans to elect anyone older than, say, 75.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Unless he's running against someone about the same age, of course.",
      "julia_azari: Right \u2014 Trump is only a few years younger than Biden.",
      "nrakich: Well, but it could give primary voters pause about supporting someone that old in the future.",
      "Monica Potts: I do think it really solidified for voters and people active in the parties to shift to younger politicians.",
      "In addition to the debate, I was also going to choose Biden's decision to run again. I don't know if there was an exact moment when that happened. He'd been hinting at a reelection campaign for months before officially announcing his bid in April 2023. At the time, he pitched his candidacy as an attempt to hold democracy together and argued that Trump was an existential threat to the country. But many voters had buried the chaos of Trump's first term, the COVID-19 pandemic and the events of Jan. 6 deep in their memory vaults. They were much more concerned with what had happened during Biden's term: record-breaking inflation and the fact that he was rapidly aging in front of them.",
      "It really makes one wonder about all of the Democratic leaders who had epiphanies about Biden's age after the debate and put pressure on him to leave the race. Why didn't they have those earlier in the cycle? He'd been running for reelection for more than a year at that point. There had been plenty of grumbling about his aging, although in fairness much of it came from anonymous sources griping to the press, and some complaints had an ableist ring to them. But as you've written, Nathaniel, some Democrats reportedly had doubts about whether he should run again at an earlier stage, and those people could have intervened in time for a primary. Almost everything else Biden accomplished will be overshadowed by that, because of course his executive and legislative legacies can be undone by Trump.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: To me, the question is, how much was Biden's legacy tied up in defeating Trump in 2020, and how much of that is undone by what happened in 2024 to bring Trump back to power?",
      "Monica has nicely linked how the campaign situation could help erode any chance for Biden to have a positive legacy. His opponent is reentering office and will attempt to undo many of Biden's accomplishments, potentially reducing the chances that anyone says in a few years, \"Wow, that thing Biden did had a long-lasting impact.\"",
      "julia_azari: I definitely think that Biden's inability to hold off Trumpism in the long term will be a big part of his legacy, but I wonder how much the particulars of the 2024 election will become a lasting part of that story.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: I guess, to me, the debate and its aftermath are a microcosm of that, Julia. An easy thing to point to.",
      "nrakich: Yeah, but also, this is something we'll be able to assess a lot better in 2029, when we know how Trump's second term went. Will he do lasting damage to our democracy, as Biden and other Democrats believe he will? Or will he actually make America great again?",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Or which of those two extremes do we end up closer to \u2026",
      "nrakich: I guess neither outcome would reflect super well on Biden.",
      "Monica Potts: Right. I think the events of the 2024 campaign will be an easy thing to point to, but I also think that Julia's correct in that, down the road, there might be a broader view of what was going on this year, and it might be wrapped into a larger story about \"The COVID-19 Era,\" or something we haven't quite named yet.",
      "nrakich: Speaking of which ...",
      "Monica, I was going to go to you next, but you already said that you agree that Biden's decision to drop out was the headline of his presidency. But do you have a runner-up?",
      "Monica Potts: I think that some of Biden's accomplishments, like the Inflation Reduction Act or his efforts to forgive a record number of student loans, may very well leave a lasting impact. It's hard to tell exactly: Trump has already promised to reverse some of the components of the Inflation Reduction Act and pull back unspent money, and we may see that first with some of the tax credits that would have gone out to homeowners and car buyers for making environmentally conscious choices.",
      "But the Inflation Reduction Act also made efforts to boost manufacturing and infrastructure in the U.S., and some things, like lithium mining in Arkansas, can probably be traced to that policy. Likewise, individuals who had their loans forgiven will have a different memory of Biden's presidency, surely, and it may impact how they're able to retire or invest as they age. So we will see.",
      "julia_azari: I think this is a good point. Something I've thought about a lot since Biden's popularity dipped in 2021 is that, with the benefit of hindsight, he might start to look like Harry Truman or Dwight Eisenhower \u2014 presidents who weren't considered terribly flashy in their own time (Eisenhower was popular but considered a lightweight by Serious Government Types) but came to be regarded as much stronger on policy and decision-making decades after they left office.",
      "(Presidential legacy-making is fascinating and someone should write a book about it.)",
      "nrakich: I agree that the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 a truly robust anti-climate-change bill \u2014 was probably Biden's biggest legislative achievement. But without tipping my hand too much, I'm skeptical that specific legislation, rather than general vibes/conditions, will be what Biden is most remembered for.",
      "I take your point about past presidents, Julia, and I think it's possible that, like Truman, people will be more impressed by Biden's policy achievements (which he accomplished with very narrow majorities in both the Senate and House) once they forget that he spent most of his presidency with pretty low approval ratings.",
      "And call me pessimistic, but I also am not sure that the Inflation Reduction Act will do enough to counter climate change to be remembered as truly transformative. We're already seeing the effects of a warming planet, and without decisive action from countries outside the U.S., the planet seems likely to get more than 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial baseline \u2014 a red line set by many scientists.",
      "Monica Potts: Something that keeps me up at night, Nathaniel.",
      "nrakich: What about you, Julia? What do you think has been the defining event of the Biden presidency?",
      "julia_azari: I am still trying to think of the event that really illustrates this, but in addition to what everyone has already said, I think Biden's presidency will be seen as a turning point in the Democratic Party (though in what direction I'm not exactly sure).",
      "Something we don't talk about a lot is that Biden's 2020 nomination was unusual in a way: If you buy coalition theories of nominations, Biden wasn't so much the \"acceptable to all factions\" nominee as the one considered most \"electable,\" and then, once he clinched the nomination, he had to spend time and effort reaching out to the progressive wing of the party.",
      "I see this fault line less as one on policy and more as a split between a faction that wanted to go back to \"normal\" after Trump, that favors institutions and the status quo, and one that wants to see serious change in the structure of American government and politics. Biden did try, I think, as a party man through and through, to bring these two factions together. But the 2024 election loss puts a lot of strain on that alliance. What's the Democrats' path forward? Will the status quo people win? The progressives? Or will this be a long period of push and pull, with visible intraparty strife? I don't know at this point.",
      "I can think of two events that illustrate this: (1) Biden saying \"fund the police\" in his 2022 State of the Union address and (2) \u2014 this is going to sound weird \u2014 the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not because it was clearly an action associated with either faction, but because it showed how much Biden's presidency was defined by contending with the decisions of his predecessors and how difficult it is to change directions, even as the American public soured on the Afghanistan war in particular and interventions like it in general.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: At a time when there's a major lack of faith in institutions, the perceived failures of an institutionalist like Biden could substantially influence Democrats moving forward. It connects to what I think is one of their larger challenges, which is being perceived as the party of government and status quo while the GOP is viewed as the anti-establishment force.",
      "Granted, let's be careful not to vastly overstate the meaning of a close election.",
      "nrakich: Interesting! Yeah, the future direction of the Democratic Party is definitely a big question going forward, but I think because of that, we won't know if this was a big part of Biden's legacy for a few more years.",
      "julia_azari: The corollary is that I wonder what Biden's legacy and Harris's loss (combined with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's loss in 2016) means for former President Barack Obama's legacy.",
      "nrakich: Now we're getting meta!",
      "I think the difference there is that Clinton's loss can't really be pinned on Obama. He was popular at the time; she wasn't. This year, Harris was more popular than Biden, so I think he is more responsible for Trump's win.",
      "julia_azari: You knew I would be annoying when you invited me. (I should get a T-shirt that says that.)",
      "Monica Potts: I think that's true, Julia, and something I hadn't thought of. What's interesting to me is that some of what Biden did as president was more progressive than the progressive wing of the party was expecting. Like Biden's National Labor Relations Board appointments, and appointing Lina Khan, a big opponent of tech monopolies, as chair of the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "nrakich: Yeah, I would actually argue that Biden was probably the most progressive president in U.S. history? But I'm not sure if he will be seen that way, and thus I'm not sure how that will affect the establishment vs. insurgent fight that's going to play out in the 2028 Democratic presidential primary.",
      "Monica Potts: Yes, agreed.",
      "julia_azari: Yes, I see that too.",
      "And Biden's reputation with the left flank of the party might be different without the Gaza issue, which we haven't talked about. But it is part of the fault line I mentioned.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Internationally, the situation in Gaza will probably be a major part of Biden's legacy. I'm not sure it'll have as much traction in domestic remembrances, but it's worth noting.",
      "Of course, that gets at another aspect of Biden's legacy: the U.S.'s place in the world and its involvement in events elsewhere. Besides Gaza, Biden's defeat might have serious consequences for Ukraine, NATO and America's alliances generally.",
      "Monica Potts: Agreed, Geoffrey, I was thinking of that too. It's hard to know how history will assess it because Trump may change or shift U.S. policy toward Israel in ways that overshadow what Biden did or didn't do, and other countries around the world have played a role as well.",
      "And yes, Trump's win will likely have consequences for how the U.S. interacts with the rest of the world going forward too.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, will we be making Smoot-Hawley comparisons here in a few years regarding protective trade measures?",
      "(OK, I might be the only one doing that.)",
      "Monica Potts: You might not be the only one: an entire generation learned about it from \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\"",
      "nrakich: Yeah, foreign policy was on my short list as well \u2014 namely, Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war and the withdrawal from Afghanistan. But I think the most remembered aspect of Biden's presidency will be something that I'm surprised hasn't come up yet: the rampant inflation of 2021 and 2022.",
      "After inflation basically went decades as a non-issue, it shot up to historic levels as the economy overheated post-pandemic and crested at 9.1 percent in June 2022. It became Republicans' go-to cudgel against Biden in the 2022 and 2024 campaigns, and the cost of living consistently ranked as Americans' number-one issue in polls. The first burst of inflation was probably at least partially responsible for Biden's approval rating going from net positive to net negative in September 2021, and of course it stayed net negative for the rest of his presidency. And according to most post-election analysis, the economy was probably the biggest factor behind Trump's victory in this year's election, keeping with the theme of that being a big part of Biden's legacy.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: I was sort of rolling inflation into the larger defeat story. But yes, undoubtedly Biden's presidency will be remembered for economic dissatisfaction. That might group him with other one-term presidents like Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush: Carter's tenure saw clear economic turmoil \u2014 \"stagflation\" and a significant shrinking of the economy \u2014 while Bush's also featured a recession. However, no one really thinks back positively about Carter's presidency, whereas the elder Bush arguably has fared better in hindsight.",
      "julia_azari: As someone who sort of remembers the H.W. Bush years, it's almost amusing how much his legacy has changed over time.",
      "Monica Potts: I guess part of me wonders whether, in hindsight, inflation will be wrapped up in the pandemic story (since it was partly caused by supply-chain issues related to the pandemic) and not thought of as part of Biden's legacy. I guess I don't know whether history will lay that at Biden's feet, and it's a pet peeve of mine that voters tend to blame presidents for every single thing that happens in this free market economy of ours.",
      "nrakich: Sure, presidents actually have little control over the economy. But I think history has shown that presidents do get assigned a lot of the credit or blame for how the economy fares under their watch. Plus, many economists believe that the American Rescue Plan \u2014 Biden's first major piece of legislation \u2014 actually did contribute somewhat to inflation.",
      "julia_azari: The economic story seems complicated to me. While inflation makes the comparisons between Carter and Biden inevitable, several other economic indicators were actually pretty strong under Biden, which wasn't the case for Carter. So I think that makes 2024 different from other incumbent-party-rejecting elections like 1980 or 2008.",
      "nrakich: You guys are already getting into it, but my next and final question was going to be, where do you think historians will place Biden in the pantheon of presidents? Will he largely be remembered positively or negatively?",
      "julia_azari: I think it sort of depends on (1) who is crafting the legacy, and whether Democrats (or people in Biden's inner circle) decide they want to work on rehabilitating Biden's legacy, and (2) what the impact and legacy of Trump's second term is.",
      "Monica Potts: I think it's hard to say, but I will go back to where we started. I think Biden's most important decision from a legacy perspective will turn out to be his decision to run again, and I think not knowing when to step aside will overshadow everything else. Everything he did while in office now has to survive a Trump presidency or risks being overshadowed by it, and it would be a completely different conversation if a Democrat were taking office next year. Although, to be clear, the anti-incumbency feeling might have extended to any Democrat, and I don't know that any of them would have won.",
      "nrakich: Yeah, one-term presidents are usually not rated very highly in historical rankings, and I suspect there's a reason for that.",
      "For instance, in C-SPAN's 2021 survey of presidential historians, eight of the top 10 presidents served two terms (or quite close to two terms, like Truman and Teddy Roosevelt). The only exceptions were Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy \u2014 two presidents who didn't have the chance to serve two terms because they were assassinated.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: I mean, if we're getting really cynical, in 50 years most people may only remember Trump from this era in history, making Biden something of a footnote analogous to, say, Benjamin Harrison or one of the other one-term presidents of the late 19th century (another period of intense partisanship and polarization).",
      "If I'm still around, I'll spend my dotage talking about it, though."

      "In her order, Cannon said she wanted to err on the side of providing more time given the seriousness of the allegations, but that starting the trial no earlier than December would be an excessive amount. A September trial date didn't amount to an \u201cunreasonable delay,\u201d she said.",

      "The fate of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet is still unclear after Republican senators spent much of December carefully dodging questions",
      "WASHINGTON -- The fate of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet is still unclear after Republican senators spent much of December carefully dodging questions about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s views on vaccines, accusations of sexual misconduct against Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard's 2017 meeting with then-President Bashar Assad of Syria.",
      "While some GOP senators have indicated they are all-in for Trump\u2019s picks, others have withheld support, for now, especially on some of his more controversial nominees. The dynamic is injecting uncertainty into the process as Republicans prepare to take the Senate majority in January with a four-seat margin and as Trump aggressively challenges them to confirm his Cabinet immediately.",
      "It\u2019s not unusual for senators to wait until after confirmation hearings to publicly announce a decision. But Republicans are under more pressure than usual as Trump and his allies make clear that they will confront senators who don\u2019t fall in line.",
      "\u201cYou only have control of the Senate because of Donald Trump,\u201d the president-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., warned during a media appearance this month. \u201cWithout that, you\u2019d be relegated to insignificance.\u201d",
      "There has been one casualty of the process so far \u2014 former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who withdrew from contention as attorney general after senators relayed private concerns. But Trump has enthusiastically stood by the rest, including Kennedy for secretary of Health and Human Services, Hegseth for secretary of Defense and Gabbard for director of national intelligence.",
      "With hearings starting by mid-January, before Trump is even inaugurated, senators will soon have to decide how closely they will scrutinize the nominees and whether they are willing to vote against any of them. Republicans will have a 53-47 majority, so Trump cannot lose more than three votes on any nomination if Democrats are united in opposition.",
      "The outcome of the confirmation process, and the level of dissent in the Senate, will likely set the tone for Trump\u2019s presidency and his relationship with Congress, which was frequently tumultuous during his first term. He often clashed with the Senate, in particular, but has signaled he expects Republican senators to be more compliant this time around.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about putting yeses on the board, it\u2019s about keeping nos off the board,\u201d said Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, one of Trump\u2019s top allies in the Senate, who speaks with him frequently.",
      "While most Senate Republicans have scrambled to display as much loyalty to Trump as possible, a handful have made clear that they are willing to defend the body\u2019s \u201cadvise and consent\u201d role. Among the senators to watch are moderate Republicans Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and incoming freshman Sen. John Curtis of Utah.",
      "\u201cAnybody who wants to give me heat for doing my job, bring it on,\u201d Curtis said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d when asked about vetting Trump\u2019s nominees. \u201cThis is my job. It\u2019s my constitutional responsibility.\u201d",
      "Still, even moderate senators have shied away from directly criticizing Trump\u2019s picks. And not a single Republican has gone on the record against a nominee.",
      "Several of Trump's picks are expected to sail to confirmation, perhaps even with some Democratic votes. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has indicated he will support Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of State and Rep. Elise Stefanik for United Nations ambassador, as have a few other Democrats.",
      "For the more controversial nominees, though, party unity will be key.",
      "One of Trump\u2019s most embattled picks is Hegseth, a Fox News host and veteran who some see as inexperienced and has publicly questioned whether women should serve in combat. He has also faced allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking that he has denied. But it's all given some senators pause, despite Trump's enthusiastic support.",
      "Hegseth has faced particular pressure from Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, herself a combat veteran who has worked to address sexual assault in the military. She has met with Hegseth several times, and has not yet said she will support him. She will have a chance to question him, publicly and face-to-face, in a Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing that is scheduled for Jan. 14.",
      "Though a hearing for Gabbard has not yet been set, senators will also be able to question her publicly and in a classified setting about her trip to Syria after the U.S had severed diplomatic relations. Gabbard has defended the trip, saying it\u2019s important to open dialogue, but critics hear echoes of Russia-fueled talking points in her commentary. Assad fled to Moscow earlier this month after opposition forces overtook Syria in a surprise attack, ending his family\u2019s five decades of rule.",
      "While Republican senators have mostly refrained from publicly expressing concerns about Gabbard\u2019s ties abroad, nearly 100 former senior U.S. diplomats and intelligence and national security officials have urged Senate leaders to schedule closed-door hearings to allow a full review of the government\u2019s files on her.",
      "Senators have been a bit more openly skeptical of Kennedy, who has long questioned the use of some vaccines.",
      "After a report in the New York Times that one of his advisers filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement saying that \u201cefforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d and that \u201canyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Census Bureau currently is getting public feedback about how it should tally responses from people into new race and ethnicity groups",
      "As the U.S. Census Bureau gets public feedback about how it should tally people into new race and ethnicity groups, the agency has released new research reflecting how U.S. residents from different backgrounds regard their racial and ethnic identities.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. government changed how it categorizes people by race and ethnicity to more accurately count residents who identify as Hispanic and of Middle Eastern and North African heritage. Before this year, the categories hadn't been changed in 27 years.",
      "Under the revisions, questions about race and ethnicity that previously were asked separately on forms will be combined into a single question. That will give respondents the option to pick multiple categories at the same time, such as \u201cBlack,\u201d \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d and \u201cHispanic.\u201d Research has shown that large numbers of Hispanic people aren\u2019t sure how to answer the race question when that question is asked separately because they understand race and ethnicity to be similar and they often pick \u201csome other race\u201d or do not answer the question.",
      "A Middle Eastern and North African category also was added to the choices available for questions about race and ethnicity. People descended from places such as Lebanon, Iran, Egypt and Syria had been encouraged to identify as white, but now will have the option of identifying themselves in the new group.",
      "Results from the 2020 census, which asked respondents to write in their backgrounds on the form, suggest that more than 3.1 million U.S. residents identify as Middle Eastern and North African, otherwise known as MENA.",
      "New research released this month by the Census Bureau showed that more than 2.4 million people, or around 80%, who wrote that their background was MENA did so under the white category in the question about their race on the 2020 census questionnaire.",
      "Almost 500,000 people, or more than 16%, who wrote that they were MENA identified themselves as \u201csome other race,\u201d and almost 139,000 MENA people, or 4.5%, identified as Asian. Almost 50,000 MENA write-ins, or 1.6%, did so under the Black race category.",
      "Among MENA subgroups, people of Lebanese and Syrian backgrounds had the highest percentages of people identifying their race as white, and people who identified as North African, Berber and Moroccan had the highest rates of marking their race as Black. People with Omani, Emirati and Saudi backgrounds identified at the highest rates as Asian, the report said.",
      "In a separate report also released this month, the Census Bureau said there was a noticeable variation regarding racial identity among different U.S. Hispanic groups in the 2020 census.",
      "\u201cSome other race\u201d and American Indian and Alaska Native responses were most common among people from Central America. White and \u201csome other race\u201d responses were most prevalent among residents from South America. Black alone responses and \u201cBlack and some other race\u201d answers were most common among people from the Caribbean, the report said.",
      "There also was variation by region and state.",
      "The Northeast and West \u2014 particularly California, Maryland and New York \u2014 had the highest share of Hispanic respondents reporting that they were \u201csome other race\u201d alone. Identifying as white alone or \u201cwhite and some other race\u201d was most common among Hispanic respondents in the South. The Northeast had the highest share of Hispanic residents reporting as Black alone or \u201cBlack and some other race.\" The Midwest had the largest rate of Hispanic residents identifying as American Indian and Alaska Native, particularly in South Dakota, the report said.",
      "The new race and ethnicity categories will be used by the Census Bureau starting in the 2027 American Community Survey \u2014 the most comprehensive survey of U.S. life \u2014 and the 2030 census, which determines how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets.",
      "The Census Bureau is seeking feedback from the public through mid-February. The statistical agency wants to hear from groups who feel that they are misclassified or if any groups should be added to the list of codes used to tally people by race and ethnicity.",

      "Three Oregon lawmakers say they plan to introduce a bill that would bar utilities from raising rates if they have unresolved wildfire lawsuits for three or more years",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Three Oregon lawmakers say they plan to introduce a bill that would bar utilities from raising rates if they have unresolved wildfire lawsuits for three or more years, describing it as an effort to hold PacifiCorp accountable as the utility faces a series of lawsuits stemming from the deadly 2020 wildfires that ravaged the state.",
      "Republican state Reps. Jami Cate, Virgle Osborne and Ed Diehl announced their proposal in a statement Monday, on the heels of an approved rate increase for PacifiCorp customers and a federal lawsuit against the electric power company.",
      "The federal government sued PacifiCorp last week over the Archie Creek Fire, which ignited in Oregon's Douglas County in September 2020 and burned more than 200 square miles (520 square kilometers), about half of which was federal land. The complaint accuses the company of negligence for failing to maintain its power lines to prevent wildfires. In its filing, the government says it brought the suit to recover \u201csubstantial costs and damages.\"",
      "A PacifiCorp spokesperson said in an emailed statement Monday that the company was working with the U.S. government to resolve the claims.",
      "\u201cIt is unfortunate the U.S. government decided to file a lawsuit in federal district court, however PacifiCorp will continue to work with the U.S. government to find reasonable resolution of this matter,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The federal lawsuit was filed on the same day the Oregon Public Utility Commission approved a 9.8% rate increase for PacifiCorp's residential customers next year. In its rate case filings, the company said its request to increase rates was partly due to higher costs stemming from wildfire risk and activity.",
      "When the new rate takes effect in January, PacifiCorp rates will have increased nearly 50% since 2021, according to the Oregon Citizens' Utility Board, which advocates on behalf of utility customers.",
      "The three lawmakers said they will introduce their bill in the upcoming legislative session, which starts in January.",
      "\u201cThe federal government is doing the right thing by filing this lawsuit, and we stand firmly behind it,\u201d Osborne, who is set to be the future bill's co-chief sponsor, said in a statement. \u201cPacifiCorp needs to pay up and take responsibility for the destruction they\u2019ve caused, and putting a stop to rate hikes is the best way to achieve it.\u201d",
      "PacifiCorp is poised to be on the hook for billions in damages in the series of lawsuits over Oregon's 2020 fires.",
      "The company has already reached two settlement agreements over the Archie Creek Fire, including one for $299 million with 463 plaintiffs impacted by the blaze and another for $250 million with 10 companies with commercial timber interests, according to its website.",
      "In other litigation, an Oregon jury in June 2023 found it liable for negligently failing to cut power to its 600,000 customers despite warnings from top fire officials and determined it should have to pay punitive and other damages \u2014 a decision that applied to a class including the owners of up to 2,500 properties. Since then, other Oregon juries have ordered the company to pay tens of millions to other wildfire victims.",
      "The wildfires that erupted across Oregon over Labor Day weekend in 2020 were among the worst natural disasters in state history, killing nine people and destroying thousands of homes."

      "California has been hit hard by extreme weather over the past several weeks",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Record-setting flooding over three days dumped more than a foot of rain on parts of northern California, a fire left thousands under evacuation orders and warnings in Los Angeles County, forecasters issued the first-ever tornado warning in San Francisco and rough seas tore down part of a wharf in Santa Cruz.",
      "All of this extreme weather has hit California in the past several weeks, showcasing the state\u2019s particular vulnerability to major weather disasters.",
      "Strong storms Tuesday produced waves that forecasters said could reach 35 feet (10.7 meters) around Santa Cruz. The National Weather Service issued a high surf warning until early evening, cautioning people to stay out of the ocean and away from piers.",
      "For Chandler Price, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Diego, these extreme weather events are both typical and unusual for a La Ni\u00f1a winter, a natural climate cycle that can cause extreme weather across the planet. In California, it means a wetter than average northern region and a drier south.",
      "\u201cSo far we\u2019ve seen that pattern play out pretty well,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cobviously, you know, the tornado in the Bay Area was atypical. ... We haven\u2019t seen that before, at least not for a very long time.\u201d",
      "A storm and wind gusts of up to 60 mph (96 kph) prompted the San Francisco tornado warning that extended to neighboring San Mateo County, which went out to about 1 million people earlier this month. The tornado overturned cars and toppled trees and utility poles near a mall in Scotts Valley, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco, injuring several people. Tornadoes do occur in California, but they rarely hit populated areas.",
      "In San Francisco, local meteorologists said straight-line winds, not a tornado, felled trees onto cars and streets and damaged roofs.",
      "The storm also dumped significant snow across the northern Sierra Nevada.",
      "F. Martin Ralph, director of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the University of California, San Diego, said climate change means that atmospheric rivers, long stretches of wet air that can produce heavy rains, will be responsible for a greater share of California\u2019s yearly precipitation and the periods in between those big events will be drier. These storms are essential for the water supply but can also be dangerous.",
      "\u201cWhen they are too strong and too many in a row, we end up getting floods,\u201d he said, adding that they drive California\u2019s weather extremes.",
      "During storms this week around Santa Cruz, one man was trapped under debris and died and another person was pulled into the ocean. The surf also splintered off the end of a Santa Cruz municipal wharf that was under construction, plunging three people into the ocean. One swam to shore and the other two were rescued.",
      "A series of atmospheric rivers are expected through the rest of the week. Overall, this pattern is not unusual \u2014 these storms regularly produce high winds, heavy snow in the mountains and torrential rain this time of year.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s a little unique about this setup is how closely spaced they are, so there\u2019s not much of a break between them,\u201d said David Lawrence, a meteorologist and emergency response specialist with the National Weather Service.",
      "Bad storms hit the state ahead of Thanksgiving, too, dumping more than a foot of rain (32 centimeters) on Santa Rosa over three record-setting days, according to federal forecasters.",
      "But these storms haven\u2019t stretched very far south, creating dry weather in Southern California that increases fire risk.",
      "One of the state\u2019s most recent blazes, the Franklin Fire left some 20,000 people under evacuation orders and warnings and forced students at Pepperdine University to shelter in place. The blaze was fueled by the Santa Anas, the notorious seasonal winds that blow dry air from the interior toward the coast, pushing back moist ocean breezes.",
      "Most of the destruction occurred in Malibu, a community on the western corner of Los Angeles known for its beautiful bluffs and the Hollywood-famous Zuma Beach. The fire damaged or destroyed 48 structures and is one of nearly 8,000 wildfires that have scorched more than 1 million acres (more than 404,685 hectares) in the Golden State this year.",
      "The Santa Ana winds, which peak in December, have also contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in parts of the southern state, said Price with the National Weather Service.",
      "\u201cEighty-degree (26.7 Celsius) Christmases are not entirely uncommon around here,\u201d he added, but \u201cthere was a couple of high temperature record breaks in the mountains, which are usually less affected by the Santa Anas, and so those were a little unusual.\u201d",

      "Police were called to the mall about 8:30 p.m. on the city's northeast side on reports of shots fired inside. Officers evacuated shoppers from the mall during a busy shopping period two days before Christmas.",
      "\u201cHow many families were put at risk, and how hard this is for these families, how close it is to the holidays,\" Officer Tommy Thompson told reporters.",
      "While police initially said no injuries were reported, a man who officers believe was wounded in the shooting later arrived at a hospital with injuries consistent with a gunshot wound. He was in stable condition, police said.",
      "Police said the shooting inside one of the mall's entrances followed a \u201cdispute\u201d between individuals. The shooting left behind a bullet hole in a wall and another in an arcade machine.",
      "The mall has been the scene of several shootings in recent years, including a January 2023 shooting outside the mall that killed a teenager and wounded a man. Police later arrested a man in that shooting.",

      "The National Weather Service on Christmas Eve warned of dangerous, large-breaking waves of up to 35 feet (10.7 meters). Its latest high surf warning will be in effect until 6 p.m. Tuesday.",
      "\u201cLarge waves can sweep across the beach without warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties and beaches,\u201d the weather service said in a Christmas Eve bulletin.",
      "Some California cities ordered beachfront homes and hotels to evacuate early Monday afternoon as forecasters warned that storm swells would continue to increase throughout the day.",

The Santa Cruz County Sheriff\u2019s Office believes a large wave pinned him there. The man was pronounced dead at a hospital.",
      "The storm\u2019s high surf also likely pulled another man into the Pacific Ocean around noon Monday at Marina State Beach, nearly 13 miles (21 kilometers) south of Watsonville, authorities said. Strong currents and high waves forced searchers to abandon their efforts roughly two hours later as conditions worsened. The man remained missing Monday evening.",
      "In Santa Cruz, a municipal wharf under construction partially collapsed and fell into the ocean around 12:45 p.m., taking three people with it. Two people were rescued by lifeguards and a third swam to safety. No one was seriously injured.",
      "\u201cWe are anticipating that what is coming toward us is more serious than what was there this morning,\u201d Santa Cruz Mayor Fred Keeley said Monday.",
      "Keeley said that section of the wharf had been damaged over time. The structure was in the middle of a $4 million renovation following destructive storms last winter about 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for those down at the end of the wharf,\u201d said David Johnston, who was allowed onto the pier to check on his business, Venture Quest Kayaking.",

      "The end of the Santa Cruz Wharf that broke off had been shut down during renovations. The portion, which included public restrooms and the closed Dolphin restaurant, floated about half a mile (0.8 kilometers) down the coast and wedged itself at the bottom of the San Lorenzo River.",
      "Those who fell into the water were two engineers and a project manager who were inspecting the end of the wharf, officials said. No members of the public were in the area.",
      "Building inspectors were looking at the rest of the pier\u2019s structural integrity.",
      "In a post on X, the National Weather Service office in Portland, Oregon, said, \u201cIt will likely go down as some of the highest surf this winter.\u201d",

      "Tarell Isaac McMillian, 34, has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Greensboro Police Officer Michael Horan in a Food Lion on Monday, Greensboro Police said in a news release. He was being held without bond.",
      "Police said McMillian also faces multiple charges related to the vehicle pursuit that led to his arrest in Duplin County, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) southeast of Greensboro in the central part of the state. Online court records do not list an attorney who could speak on McMillian's behalf. Police said they were not seeking anyone else in the investigation.",
      "Horan was responding to the report when he was shot shortly before midday at a Food Lion store in Greensboro. Authorities said Monday afternoon that the circumstances of the shooting remain under investigation. The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, the state's lead law enforcement agency, is continuing the investigation.",
      "Horan was hired in 2017 and became a sworn Greensboro Police Department officer in early 2018, Assistant Police Chief Milford J. Harris said. Horan served in the department\u2019s patrol bureau. He also was a U.S. Coast Guard member since 2000, according to his LinkedIn profile.",

      "Sebastian Zapeta, 33, is facing murder and arson charges in the woman\u2019s death.",
      "Federal immigration officials said Zapeta is a Guatemalan citizen who entered the U.S. illegally after he was previously deported in 2018.",
      "The apparently random attack occurred Sunday morning on a stationary F train at the Coney Island station in Brooklyn, police said.",
      "Authorities say Zapeta approached the woman, who was sitting motionless in the train car and may have been sleeping, and used a lighter to set her clothing on fire. The woman quickly became engulfed in flames, while Zapeta then sat at a bench on the subway platform and watched as police officers and a transit worker doused the fire, according to police.",
      "The woman, whose identity has not yet been released, was pronounced dead at the scene.",
      "Zapeta was arrested Sunday afternoon while riding a train on the same subway line after police got a tip from some teenagers who recognized him from images circulated by the police.",
      "It was unclear if Zapeta has an attorney. A Brooklyn address for Zapeta released by police matches a shelter that provides housing and substance abuse support. The shelter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a statement, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called the attack a \u201cgruesome and senseless act of violence against a vulnerable woman\u201d that would be \u201cmet with the most serious consequences.\u201d",
      "The crime \u2014 and a graphic video of it that ricocheted across social media \u2014 deepened a growing sense of unease among New Yorkers about the safety of the subway system.",
      "Violent crimes on trains in the city can put riders on edge, in part because most New Yorkers take the subway multiple times each day and often have their own experiences with uncomfortable interactions in the system.",
      "Policing the subway is also difficult, given the vast network of trains constantly moving between the system's 472 stations, with each stop containing multiple entry points and, in many stations, multiple floors and platforms. On Sunday, police at the station where the woman burned to death were patrolling a different area and responded after seeing and smelling smoke, authorities said.",
      "Overall, according to authorities, crime is down in the transit system this year when compared to last year.",
      "Major felonies declined 6% between January and November of this year and in 2023, data compiled by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority show. But murders are up, with nine killings this year through November compared to five in the same period last year.",
      "At the same time, high-profile incidents on the train \u2014 such as the case of Daniel Penny, a military veteran who choked an agitated New York subway rider and was acquitted of homicide this month \u2014 often attract national attention and further frighten passengers."

Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That\u2019s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper leaves his job next week after eight years",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is leaving his job after eight years in which the southern Democrat picked his moments against a Republican-dominated legislature, winning big on Medicaid expansion and clean energy while falling short in fights over private-school vouchers and abortion rights.",
      "Cooper, who steered the state through the coronavirus pandemic, Hurricanes Helene and Florence and an early flashpoint in the culture wars over access to public restrooms, was barred from seeking a third consecutive term. He is wrapping up 24 consecutive years in statewide office \u2014 the first 16 as attorney general.",
      "In a December interview with The Associated Press at the executive mansion, Cooper reflected on his gubernatorial terms with an emphasis on the positive \u2014 an easier undertaking compared with many Democrats around the country in the aftermath of this year's election.",
      "\"To be able to wake up every morning and get to lead the state that you love has been humbling, challenging and fulfilling. I have really valued every day,\u201d said Cooper, who will be succeeded by state Attorney General Josh Stein, a fellow Democrat, in early January.",
      "Faced with veto-proof majorities for almost half of his time as governor, Cooper was unable to stop many GOP initiatives, including deep income tax cuts, taxpayer-funded vouchers to help public school students attend private schools and new restrictions on abortion.",
      "But Cooper, one of several Democratic governors seen as potential contenders for federal office, managed last year to persuade GOP legislative leaders to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 something he had sought since getting sworn in as governor in 2017. Now 600,000 low-income adults are enrolled in the program a year ahead of expectations.",
      "\u201cThis is a generational investment in people\u2019s health,\u201d Cooper said during a farewell address last week in Nash County, where he grew up and launched his first gubernatorial campaign in 2015. Another bipartisan agreement was reached in 2021 on a milestone energy bill that ordered sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.",
      "Cooper takes credit for conditions that led to big corporate expansions that he says have contributed to hundreds of thousands of new jobs being created during the past eight years, including those in the clean energy sector. But he also gives his rare praise to Republican lawmakers for all working together on offering economic incentives that have lured companies such as Apple, Toyota and Boom Supersonic to build in the state.",
      "Still, Republicans contend Cooper receives too much acclaim for the state\u2019s broad economic success and has pushed for reckless state spending at every turn. Most of his record 100-plus vetoes were overridden.",
      "\u201cThere has not been a governor who has had less of his agenda enacted and North Carolina has succeeded in spite of his leadership failures,\" state GOP spokesperson Matt Mercer said.",
      "Regardless, Cooper\u2019s perceived accomplishments in a swing state raised his national profile during this year\u2019s presidential campaign, making him as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris until he said it \"just wasn\u2019t the right time\" for him and for North Carolina. Now Cooper, 67, will have to decide whether trying to unseat U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, in 2026 is in the cards after holding what he calls the \u201cbest job I have ever had.\u201d",
      "While North Carolina Democrats have won eight of past nine gubernatorial elections, they haven\u2019t won a U.S. Senate race since 2008.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to run for public office again, you must have your heart and soul in it, you must have the fire in the belly,\u201d Cooper told the AP.",
      "With that in mind, he said he planned to take a couple of months to clear his head before deciding what\u2019s next: \u201cI\u2019m going to think about how I can best contribute to the things that I care about.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s little wonder why many North Carolina Democrats want Cooper to remain on the political stage. He has never lost a race for state office, from the legislature in the mid-1980s and including a 10,000-vote win over then-GOP Gov. Pat McCrory in 2016.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s done really from my perspective is he\u2019s kept the progressive flame alive in North Carolina in a difficult time,\u201d said Gary Pearce, a longtime Democratic political consultant who worked with four-term Gov. Jim Hunt. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody else could have done it as well as he did.\u201d",
      "Cooper took on Republicans even before he was sworn in.",
      "As governor-elect he began a series of lawsuits challenging legislation approved weeks before he took office that shifted executive branch powers to the legislature. The legal results were mixed, and even now litigation over his appointment powers remains in court. This month, Republican lawmakers enacted more changes that would weaken Stein's gubernatorial authority. A lawsuit has been filed.",
      "In his first three months in office, Cooper worked with lawmakers to partially repeal the 2016 \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which had required transgender people to use public bathrooms aligned with the gender on their birth certificate. The law had lost the state business, including canceled sporting events and job expansions, and \u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s reputation was in tatters,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Eight years later, \u201cwe built a North Carolina that is healthier, better educated, with more money in people\u2019s pockets, and we stand ready to welcome prosperity with open arms for generations to come,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Republicans cite several shortcomings in Cooper's administration. They include spending overruns at the state Department of Transportation; continued delays to rebuild or renovate homes for eastern North Carolina residents after Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018; and executive orders that helped extend restrictions on businesses and school instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful dealing with the governor fiscally,\u201d Republican state Sen. Warren Daniel said. \u201cI just think he\u2019s not very good at managing government.\u201d",
      "Cooper has defended his actions, particularly his pandemic leadership, saying North Carolina came out better than many other states.",
      "Even in policy defeats, Cooper secured the admiration of supporters. The Democratic governor used lots of political capital in 2023 trying unsuccessfully to block a law that changed the state\u2019s ban on most abortions from after 20 weeks of pregnancy to 12 weeks. Republicans overrode his veto.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s simply no governor who\u2019s ever fought as hard or as publicly as Gov. Cooper has to protect access to abortion,\u201d said Paige Johnson with Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Plenty of North Carolinians see that differently. Cooper\u2019s opposition to the abortion bill reflects an administration that \u201chas been consistently hostile to policies that serve the best interests of North Carolina families,\u201d said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition.",
      "Cooper said he has confidence that Stein, who succeeded him as attorney general, will \u201ccontinue a lot of the progress that we have made.\u201d Cooper hired Stein two decades ago, while attorney general, to be his consumer protection chief.",
      "Otherwise, Cooper knows that he\u2019ll miss \u201chaving the opportunity every single day to do something to make a real difference.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you can do in this job,\u201d he added. \"And whatever I decide to do, that\u2019s going to be hard to replicate.\""

    "summary": "Conservators have uncovered eight angels in a historic Boston church that counted Paul Revere as a bell ringer and played a pivotal role in the Revolutionary War",
    "story": [
      "Conservators have uncovered eight angels in a historic Boston church that counted Paul Revere as a bell ringer and played a pivotal role in the Revolutionary War",
      "BOSTON -- Straddling the scaffolding high up in a historic Boston church, murals conservator Gianfranco Pocobene is working to uncover eight angels that were hidden under layers of paint for more than a century.",
      "The painted angels \u2014 with round childlike faces and wings \u2014 once were among the defining features of Old North Church when they were painted around 1730. But officials at the church, a seminal location of the Revolutionary War, painted over the angels in 1912 with thick coats of white paint, part of an austere renovation that restorationists are trying to reverse.",
      "\u201cWhen we first looked at the project six months ago, we had no idea what was here,\u201d Pocobene said as the church, the oldest church building in Boston, was preparing to remove the scaffolding earlier this month to reveal eight of the 20 painted-over angels.",
      "\u201cIt's really been quite a revelation to find these really interesting and historic works of art on the walls of the church that nobody has seen in our lifetime,\" he continued. \u201dJust to be part of a project where we are revealing something from colonial America is really extraordinary.\"",
      "A popular stop for tourists visiting Boston's North End, the Old North Church is best known for the two lanterns hung from its steeple on the night of Paul Revere\u2019s 1775 ride to warn of the British army\u2019s approach. Revere was also a teenage bell ringer in the congregation. In 1860, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote \u201cPaul Revere\u2019s Ride,\u201d mentioning the church and introducing the phrase, \u201cone if by land, and two if by sea.\u201d",
      "But as the 250th anniversary of Revere's ride approaches in April, church officials also want to draw attention to its beginnings in 1723 and its identity, both as a beacon of liberty but also its connections to the slave trade \u2014 many of its first congregants profited off slavery. The church was built to house Boston's growing colonial Anglican community and its interior was much more colorful and dynamic than what visitors see today.",
      "\u201cFor much of the church\u2019s history, people who were coming here to the church would have seen those angels, would have seen the colorful interior,\u201d said Emily Spence, the associate director of education at Old North Illuminated, which operates the church as a historic site.",
      "\u201cThe color scheme was an important part of the identity of the people who worshiped here as members of the congregation of a Church of England church,\u201d she said, adding the interiors would have set the church apart from Puritans who dominated Boston at the time.",
      "Spence said that exploration started in September with efforts to restore the sandstone and teal-colored angels \u2014 eight completed this month and another eight by the spring. They were made to look like stone sculptures and it remains unclear why they were painted over.",
      "Researchers knew from the historical record that the angels were on the walls and they still have a copy of a contract signed with John Gibbs, a congregation member who painted them. A paint study completed in 2017 confirmed their presence but their condition was unclear.",
      "Corrine Long, a painting conservator who works with Pocobene, said one of the challenges was removing seven layers of paint without damaging the angels. The team first applied a solvent gel to soften the layers of paint and then manually removed it with a plastic scraper. After that, they cleaned the angels with cotton swabs before retouching to remove any signs of damage.",
      "Once Pocobene and Long started removing the paint, they knew they'd uncovered something special.",
      "\"They all have their own character \u2014 they're not copies,\u201d Pocobene, who has his own studio in Lawrence, Massachusetts, said. \u201cThe artist John Gibbs painted them individually and they\u2019re all in different poses, which gives them a really wonderful rhythmic kind of pattern across the surface of the church.\u201d",
      "For Long, one of the most satisfying parts of the project was returning parts of the church to what the founders had intended \u2014 and what tourists should see.",
      "\u201cWhenever I go into a building with history, it amazes me to be surrounded with paintings or the decorations that were there originally,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s been repainted to be white, it takes away some of that majesty and some of that history.\"",
      "On a recent day, the church was mostly empty except for the conservators. But two tourists, Sean Dixon and Sarah Jardine from California, did slip in. They walked the aisles and stared up at the scaffolding. It was hard to see the angels through all the steel but what they did see inspired them.",
      "\u201cI was kind of shocked when I first saw it,\u201d said Dixon, an account manager from San Francisco. \u201cIt looks really cool and I\u2019m really excited to see the full picture once the scaffolding comes down.\u201d"

      "The visit led by Robert Petit, head of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria, was the first since the organization was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 2016. It was created to assist in evidence-gathering and prosecution of individuals responsible for possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide since Syria\u2019s civil war began in 2011.",
      "Petit highlighted the urgency of preserving documents and other evidence before it is lost.",
      "Since the rebel overthrow of Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad and the rebel opening of prisons and detention facilities there have been rising demands from Syrians for the prosecution of those responsible for atrocities and killings while he was in power.",
      "\u201cThe fall of the Assad rule is a significant opportunity for us to fulfill our mandate on the ground,\u201d Petit said. \u201cTime is running out. There is a small window of opportunity to secure these sites and the material they hold.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe representatives from the caretaker authorities were very receptive to our request for cooperation and are aware of the scale of the task ahead,\u201d the spokesperson said, speaking on condition of not being named. \u201cThey emphasized that they will need expertise to help safeguard the newly accessible documentation.\u201d",
      "The IIIM did not disclose which officials in the new government it met with or the site that Petit visited afterward.",
      "\u201cEven at one facility,\u201d Petit said, \u201cthe mountains of government documentation reveal the chilling efficiency of systemizing the regime\u2019s atrocity crimes.\u201d",
      "He said that a collective effort by Syrians, civil society organizations and international partners will be needed, as a priority, \u201c to preserve evidence of the crimes committed, avoid duplication, and ensure that all victims are inclusively represented in the pursuit of justice.\u201d",
      "In June 2023, the 193-member General Assembly also established an Independent Institution of Missing Persons in the Syrian Arab Republic to clarify the fate and whereabouts of more than 130,000 people missing as a result of the conflict."

    "story": [
      "Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Gov.-elect Josh Stein have filed another lawsuit against a GOP-inspired law that strips away powers from several incoming Democratic state leaders",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's current governor and his successor tacked on another lawsuit Monday disputing a key provision within a GOP law that erodes the powers of several incoming Democratic state leaders \u2014 the latest in a longstanding power struggle between North Carolina's executive and legislative branches over who controls the state's elections.",
      "The lawsuit challenges one of the law's core power shifts that move the ability to appoint members of the North Carolina State Board of Elections from the governor's authority to the state auditor's office \u2014 which will be run by Republican Dave Boliek next year. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Gov.-elect Josh Stein, who currently serves as the state attorney general, filed the suit in Wake County Superior Court on Monday, saying in the complaint that the provision is unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers.",
      "The change to state election board appointments will take place next spring if it isn't blocked in court. The state elections board would likely remain under GOP control for the next few years and would trickle down to county boards as well.",
      "\u201cWe have had the same structure for our state board of elections for nearly a century and it has served North Carolina well, with fair and secure elections across our state through every cycle,\u201d Cooper said in a news release Monday. \u201cThese blatantly partisan efforts to give control over elections boards to a newly elected Republican will create distrust in our elections process and serve no legitimate purpose.\u201d",
      "The suit from Cooper and Stein is the second challenge the pair has levied against the GOP-controlled state legislature concerning the law. Cooper and Stein are also contesting another provision that prevents the governor from choosing his State Highway Patrol commander.",
      "Those alterations to the governor's powers were part of a larger swath of changes to several statewide offices that Democrats won in November and will preside over next year \u2014 such as attorney general, state schools superintendent and lieutenant governor.",
      "If the law withstands the court challenges, it would further underscore the GOP-led legislature's tightened grip over the other two branches of government since Republicans took control of the General Assembly more than a decade ago. Last year, GOP supermajorities in both the House and Senate firmed up power even more.",
      "Pending legal disputes in a few outstanding races, Republicans could lose their supermajority if Democratic challenger Bryan Cohn's attempt to oust incumbent Republican Rep. Frank Sossamon proves successful. That would give Stein a slightly more effective veto stamp on future Republican legislation if Democratic lawmakers stay unified.",
      "Republican legislators passed the law in both chambers earlier this month \u2014 not without scathing disapproval from crowds of protesters in the building.",
      "The bill drew the ire of House and Senate Democrats, as well as some community organizers, who denounced it as a \u201cpower grab.\u201d They also criticized Republican lawmakers for tying the power shifts to disaster relief funding for western North Carolina in Hurricane Helene's aftermath. Most of the $252 million in recovery funds included in the law can't be spent until the next time the General Assembly acts.",
      "But GOP legislators defended the bill, with incoming House Speaker Destin Hall saying during the House vote that the changes are within the legislature's constitutional right. Republicans also point to previous Democratic actions, such as weakening the state\u2019s first GOP governor in 1972, as reasons necessitating the legislation.",
      "Spokespeople for Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore \u2014 who are both defendants listed in the lawsuit \u2014 did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday evening. A state elections board spokesperson also did not immediately respond.",
      "Changes to the state elections board aren't a first for GOP lawmakers. Previous attempts have been blocked by courts, including a suit last year that would move board appointment authority from the governor to the General Assembly. Berger and Moore's attorneys moved to dismiss that case last week, and the new lawsuit from Cooper and Stein seeks to replace it."

    "story": [
      "Pascual Andreu points proudly to a black-and-white photograph stuck to the wall of the premises of his chocolate-making business. Staring out from it is his grandfather, who started the company in 1914.",
      "But, as he looks around him and remembers the destruction caused by the flash floods which struck the eastern Spanish region of Valencia on 29 October, tears well up in Andreu's eyes.",
      "\"The water came in and water and mud covered everything,\" he says. \"And when it had gone, it left a terrible sight. All the stock we had was ruined, the machinery was useless.\"",
      "He adds: \"All my life working. And for what?\"",
      "The floodwater left a six-feet-high (1.8m) mark on the wall, and although the water has now gone, mud still clings to the machines. Miraculously, the photo of his grandfather was not washed away.",
      "But, now in his sixties, and still waiting to see how much insurance money he might receive, Andreu is too disheartened to start over.",
      "The flash flood killed more than 220 people in the Valencia region, many of them caught in their cars, or on the ground floors of buildings when the tsunami-like waters hit. But as well as claiming lives, the disaster also devastated livelihoods. Valencia's chamber of commerce estimated that 48,000 companies have been affected.",
      "The towns and industrial belt surrounding the Mediterranean city of Valencia, which itself avoided the impact of the floods, were the worst hit. In total, the province of Valencia represents 5% of Spain's GDP, according to CaixaBank Research, which estimates that the disaster could reduce national economic output by one to two percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
      "Much of the damage has been caused on industrial estates. Diego Rom\u00e1, executive president of the federation of industrial estates in the Valencia region (Feteval), says that \"thousands and thousands of jobs are in the air\" and that a total of 58 industrial estates were affected by the flood water.",
      "\"Most companies are working hard to resume production, but unfortunately there are maybe 10 to 20% of companies which are going to close,\" he said.",
      "The legacy of 29 October is still visible on the industrial estates. Abandoned cars sit on the side of the road covered in mud, debris has been pushed up against walls and the shutters of many businesses remain closed.",
      "Electro Fern\u00e1ndez, an electricity installation company, is one of the few which has reopened, having lost \u20ac40,000 ($42,000; \u00a333,000) worth of tools in the floods.",
      "\"We were immediately affected 100% because we lost our tools and vehicles,\" said Patricia Mu\u00f1oz, who co-owns the company with her husband. She says that they are currently working at 10% of their capacity.",
      "\"We've cleaned the place, we've got all our employees here, and we've taken action to get going again,\" she says. \"But a lot of the companies on this industrial estate, and on others are nowhere near that, they are still cleaning up.",
      "\"This has been an absolute disaster. You only realise the scale of it when you see it for yourself.\"",
      "Not far away is a car storage area, where hundreds of the 120,000 or so vehicles damaged or destroyed by the flooding have been removed from roads and piled one on top of the other. As part of a \u20ac17bn relief plan announced by the government in the first month after the tragedy, it promised to provide up to 10,000 euros to car owners to replace their vehicles.",
      "Businesses and self-employed workers are also due to benefit, with compensation for damage caused to homes and corporate premises. A furlough scheme is also in place.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, told congress in late November that his government was \"making a titanic effort\" to ensure that the promised funds reach those in need as soon as possible. However, not everyone is convinced.",
      "\"I think that official financial aid is badly managed,\" says Toni Milla, president of a local business association in the town of Alfafar, which was heavily affected. He says that a lot of the relief for businesses promised during the Covid pandemic did not reach its destination.",
      "\"I think this time the same thing is going to happen,\" he says.",
      "Valencians' faith in their authorities has already been severely shaken by the immediate response to the disaster. Protesters have been demanding the resignation of regional president Carlos Maz\u00f3n, who, it emerged, was absent from his office for several hours on the day the floods struck because he was having lunch with a journalist. Many believe his administration's delay in issuing an alert to the phones of people in the region cost lives.",
      "Maz\u00f3n has rejected such claims. \"We did the best we could with the information available,\" he says.",
      "Others criticise the central government for failing to deploy the military and other resources more forcefully. S\u00e1nchez, however, has insisted that his administration \"fulfilled its duties and did so from the very beginning\" of the crisis.",
      "Meanwhile, help has been provided by the private sector. Alcem-se, a charity platform set up by local supermarket entrepreneur Juan Roig, says it has distributed \u20ac35m euros in non-refundable aid to 4,600 businesses.",
      "However, for many, including Mr Milla, the relief may not be enough. He owned a local TV channel, an estate agency and a bar and he has only managed to reopen the latter \u2013 partially \u2013 in the wake of the October floods.",
      "He lists several nearby businesses - including a petrol station, a gym, a beautician and an optician \u2013 which he says will not reopen.",
      "But it is not just urban areas which were hit on 29 October. The Valencia region is part of an agricultural heartland in south-eastern Spain, which exports large quantities of fruit and vegetables to the rest of Europe.",
      "Twenty-five miles (40km) south of Valencia city, Jos\u00e9 Espa\u00f1a visits his orange trees. Beneath them, oranges which were washed off their branches by the floodwater lie rotting on the ground.",
      "\"Farmers always say 'next year things will get better', but right now, the mood among farmers is very pessimistic,\" he said. The agricultural association he is a member of, AVA-ASAJA, estimates that well over \u20ac1bn euros worth of damage was caused on 29 October to crops alone.",
      "\"Farmers have had a few years now in which we've been abandoned, and the floods might end up causing a few more farmers than usual to leave the industry,\" he says. \"In order to get things back to how they were before the flooding, it's going to take two or three years.\"",

      "Sega is considering launching its own Netflix-like subscription service for video games, a move which would accelerate gaming's transition towards streaming.",

      "Sega's president Shuji Utsumi told the BBC such subscription products were \"very interesting\", and his firm was \"evaluating some opportunities\".",
      "\"We're thinking something - and discussing something - we cannot disclose right now,\" he said.",

      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",

      "The system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors, and samples from many more patients. More data can improve the algorithm, just as algorithms for self-driving cars can improve with more testing on the street.",

    "summary": "Almost 300 children with special needs in Worcestershire are being home schooled.",
    "story": [
      "Worcestershire has seen a \"shocking\" rise in the number of children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) being home-schooled, often \"by default\", and running the risk of falling \"out of sight\" of the education system.",
      "From fewer than 50 in 2016, the number has risen to almost 300.",
      "A further 88 children with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) were being home-schooled as of September 2024, according to Worcestershire County Council.",
      "One campaigner said parents felt they had no choice but to pursue home schooling, because \"the system is letting them down\" over school places.",
      "The figures were requested by county councillor Lynn Denham, during a full council meeting in November.",
      "She received a written response on the number of \"elected home education (EHE) children with SEND\" from education chief David Chambers, which has been seen by the Local Democracy Reporting Service.",
      "Chambers said any children being removed from the roll of a school were a focus for the authority, to ensure \"the decision had been made appropriately and in an informed way\".",
      "He said the council's elected home education team continued to ensure any students with additional needs were prioritised, and there was \"joint working\" when a parent or carer decided to educate their child at home.",
      "'Falling through the gaps'",
      "Lynn Denham, a county councillor and leader of Worcester City Council, said the statistics showed \"a shocking increase\" in home-school numbers among children with SEND, who previously had SEND support in a school setting.",
      "She said: \"These children have not succeeded in getting an EHCP, mainstream schools are not meeting their needs, and they are being home-schooled by default.",
      "\"This is a huge strain on families and indicates that the county council is failing to meet its duties to provide education for all children in the county.\"",
      "Denham said the data indicated there were children with special needs who were \"falling through the gaps\" and were \"in danger of being out of sight of the education system\".",
      "She said: \"Home schooling is the last act of desperation when parents are unable to obtain a suitable school place for their child from the county council.\"",
      "'System is letting them down'",
      "Tracy Winchester, from the SEND National Crisis Worcestershire campaign group, said the statistics spoke for themselves, highlighting there were not enough SEND places in schools across the county.",
      "She said: \"People often feel they have no real choice.",
      "\"Their child's needs are not being met \u2013 the system is letting them down.\"",
      "Chambers, the cabinet member for education at the county council, said families had the right to electively home educate their children, and the council provided information in order so people could make informed decisions in a positive way.",
      "He said: \"There are a wide range of factors which lead families to choose to electively home educate and for many families the choice is carefully considered to be in the best interests of their child and provides a broad and balanced, rich educational experience.",
      "\"When parents choose elective home education, we fulfill our duties by working collaboratively with families to support their decision, including offering assistance if they decide to return their child to school-based education.\"",

      "Parent Georgia Sutcliffe said: \"I think it's galvanising all the parents. That's what so wonderful about the school is that it's in the middle of Soho, it's got a great pool of people who are helping and encouraging everyone with the funding issue, which I'm sure we'll sort out.\"",

      "1. Katy Perry's comeback",
      "It was supposed to be a triumphant return, but critics and fans complained Katy Perry's latest album 143 sounded dated and showed little artistic growth.",
      "The music video for Woman's World, which saw Perry join a group of dancers wearing tiny outfits on a construction site, was criticised for being regressive, although Perry later said it was supposed to be satirical.",
      "Matters were only made worse when the singer attracted the attention of the Spanish government for shooting the video for follow-up single Lifetimes in ecologically-sensitive sand dunes in the Balearic Islands.",
      "But many fans defended the album, which wasn't as bad as some reviews made out, and Perry's accompanying tour has been a huge success.",
      "2. Joker bombing at the box office",
      "Making a sequel to 2019's Joker, which grossed more than $1bn (\u00a3790m), was something Hollywood found simply irresistible.",
      "Unfortunately, the resulting film, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, was something audiences found entirely resistible.",
      "Making the film a musical was a bold swing, but the tonal handbrake turn alienated the fans and critics who adored the Oscar-winning original.",
      "Folie \u00e0 Deux managed to scrape over the $200m (\u00a3158m) mark, but that was barely enough to cover its production budget, let alone marketing costs.",
      "It wasn't the only movie flop of the year - audiences were also unenthusiastic about Madame Web, The Fall Guy, Kraven the Hunter, Megalopolis, Borderlands, Argylle, Unstoppable and Furiosa: A Mad Max Story.",
      "3. Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing",
      "Ticketmaster attracted a storm of controversy after making use of so-called \"dynamic pricing\" for UK dates on the Oasis reunion tour, which raised the cost of a ticket by \u00a3200 due to the predictable demand.",
      "Charging fans \u00a3350 per ticket was a dubious PR move for a band famous for their working class roots, and the Gallagher brothers wisely distanced themselves from the strategy.",
      "But Ticketmaster argued prices are set by artists and promoters. Dynamic pricing was later ditched for the band's US tour dates.",
      "Meanwhile, 50,000 fans who'd paid inflated prices on secondary platforms in order to secure tickets faced having them cancelled. A total omnishambles for everyone involved.",
      "4. The ruined surprise party",
      "When BBC weather presenter Kawser Quamer was asked in February about her plans for the weekend, she cheerfully explained she was attending her niece's surprise birthday party.",
      "Host Annabel Tiffin said that all sounded very lovely, but presumably the party was no longer a surprise, having just been announced on live TV. \"Oh goodness me,\" replied an alarmed Quamer, \"I've spoiled the surprise!\"",
      "The glorious mishap made its way across the Atlantic, going viral and featuring on Jimmy Kimmel Live.",
      "But Quamer handled it beautifully, and even managed to convince her niece she was talking about a different relative, keeping the surprise element intact.",
      "5. Kaos",
      "Chaos is a term which could be applied to a lot of entries in this list, but one of the biggest casualties of the year was Kaos itself.",
      "Just a month after the first series of Jeff Goldblum's Greek mythology drama was released, Netflix announced it would not return for a second.",
      "Streamers can tell quickly if something is a hit or not by measuring viewing figures and completion rates. Their data even gives them the prospective ratings of the following months based on the first.",
      "But although fans campaigned for its return, ultimately Kaos was Kancelled.",
      "6. The Co-op Live Arena",
      "Manchester's hottest new live venue finally opened this year, but only after several attempts. There was a string of cancellations due to various technical problems, including a ventilation unit falling from the ceiling.",
      "Shows by Peter Kay, Olivia Rodrigo, Take That and others were cancelled or moved, before the venue finally opened with a successful concert from rock band Elbow.",
      "The problems did at least bring one delightful moment: A Radio 4 newsreader announcing the delay of a gig by US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.",
      "7. Joe Biden's debate performance",
      "Flops don't come much bigger than a debate performance which was so poor, it brought down an entire presidential campaign.",
      "Joe Biden seemed distant and frail when he took part in a televised live debate in June, struggling to finish some of his sentences and keep pace with Donald Trump.",
      "Biden tried to stay in the race, but the pressure on him became too high as figures including Democrat fundraiser George Clooney publicly called for him to stand down, leading to Kamala Harris replacing him as the candidate.",
      "8. The Olympics opening ceremony",
      "A barnstorming performance from Celine Dion sadly wasn't enough to rescue this soggy croissant of an opening ceremony, which was badly hampered by rain.",
      "Organisers took the event outside of the traditional stadium setting and had performers spread out across Paris instead, which was both a security nightmare and challenging for spectators.",
      "The spread meant things felt somewhat disjointed and it was hard for the ceremony to build any momentum.",
      "Meanwhile, some viewers were upset by a scene involving drag queens which many interpreted as a reference to the Last Supper, but artistic director Thomas Jolly said was a reference to pagan gods.",
      "9. The unofficial Bridgerton ball",
      "Hot on the heels of the disastrous Willy Wonka experience was an unofficial Bridgerton ball, where fans of the Netflix series were invited to dress up and \"step into the enchanting world of the Regency era\".",
      "Unfortunately, they were greeted with disappointing food and drab decor, with one violinist and a pole dancer for entertainment. Creators blamed \"organisational challenges\" and said they \"sincerely apologised\".",
      "We anticipate the event being eviscerated in Lady Whistledown's next newsletter.",
      "10. Eurovision. The whole thing.",
      "This year's Eurovision Song Contest was, frankly, a disaster from start to finish.",
      "A row about Israel's participation prompted security concerns, put all the entrants in an awkward position and even led to the head of Eurovision being booed during the grand final.",

      "And to top it all off, the UK languished in 18th place.",
      "11. Broadcasting blunders",
      "Laura Kuenssberg withdrew from an interview with Boris Johnson in October after mistakenly sending her briefing notes to the former prime minister himself, resulting in what she called a few \"red faces\".",
      "ITV took over and Johnson later told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley his originally scheduled interview had \"blown up on the launch pad\".",
      "Elsewhere, thousands of viewers complained to Ofcom in August when Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was interviewed on Good Morning Britain by her own husband, Ed Balls, about the violent unrest in parts of the UK.",
      "ITV's chief executive later noted it was a fluid news morning and the team had short notice that Cooper was coming on. She said the interview was impartial and fair but it wouldn't happen again.",
      "Another daytime presenter, Lorraine Kelly, became the subject of a viral X account which monitored her show attendance throughout the year (hovering just below 60%, if you're interested).",
      "Over on Strictly Come Dancing, which had already had a fairly appalling year before this series even started, fans were puzzled by some unusual on-screen encounters between singer Wynne Evans and his partner Katya Jones.",
      "Viewers spotted Jones apparently refusing to high-five Evans, and later moving his hand away from her waist.",
      "The show's welfare team checked in on them after concerns were raised, but the pair apologised for what they said was actually just a \"very silly inside joke\" between them.",
      "12. The Oppenheimer stage invasion",
      "When Oppenheimer was named best film at February's Baftas, the prize was collected by actor Cillian Murphy, director Christopher Nolan, producer Emma Thomas... and a random man standing silently in the background.",

      "In an emotional monologue, she reflected on the fact you don't really know what's going on in each other's lives, as footage switched between different characters being told the news.",

She's now filed an explosive legal case that she claims lifts the lid on \"hostile work environments\" that are created to harm reputations in Hollywood - and which are making people question who and what to believe.",
      "Blake Lively had always been a pretty inoffensive kind of actress.",
      "She had been in successful TV shows and films, like Gossip Girl and The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. She married fellow superstar Ryan Reynolds. She's friends with Taylor Swift.",
      "Then in August, while promoting her latest movie It Ends With Us, she suddenly became controversial, to the verge of being cancelled.",
      "She was criticised for comments appearing to downplay domestic violence, the film's theme; while awkward old interviews were resurfaced and repurposed as evidence of bullying behaviour.",
      "Public opinion - at least among those who knew and cared - seemed to have turned against her.",
      "Then the film came out, the furore died down, and social media moved on.",
      "But Lively has now filed a legal case that claims she suffered sexual harassment by It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni - and that when she complained, he and his studio Wayfarer retaliated by waging a campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation.",
      "She was the subject of \"a sophisticated, co-ordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" designed \"to silence her\", involving a \"weaponised a digital army\" and fake stories being fed to \"unwitting reporters\", her lawyers have alleged - and that's why she became the focus of negative publicity.",
      "Throughout the complaint, which spans some 80 pages, Lively's team repeatedly accuses Badoni and Wayfarer of creating a \"hostile work environment that nearly derailed production of the film\".",
      "Her lawyers have published text messages sent between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and Melissa Nathan, a crisis communications specialist hired by his studio to help manage the harassment complaint. They appear to give a rare glimpse into conversations that are normally kept well out of the spotlight.",
      "Nathan pitched a strategy to \"start threads of theories\" on social media, to \"create, seed, and promote content that appeared to be authentic\", and engage in \"social manipulation\", according to the legal papers.",
      "\"You know we can bury anyone,\" Nathan wrote to Abel in one damning discussion.",
      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni: What you need to know",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Actor Baldoni women's solidarity award rescinded amid allegations",
      "Now, the people hired to do crisis PR for Baldoni are doing crisis PR for themselves.",
      "Abel has said Lively's lawyers \"cherry picked\" messages to include in their case without crucial context, and that there was \"no 'smear' implemented\".",
      "\"No negative press was ever facilitated, no social combat plan, although we were prepared for it as it's our job to be ready for any scenario.",
      "\"But we didn't have to implement anything because the internet was doing the work for us.\"",
      "The backlash against Lively occurred naturally and didn't need their help, Abel said.",
      "Lawyer Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni and his studio as well as Abel and Nathan, echoed that.",
      "He said Baldoni hired a crisis manager due to \"multiple demands and threats\" allegedly made by Lively, including \"threatening to not [show] up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "He said the plan drawn up by Nathan's firm \"proved unnecessary as audiences found Lively's own actions, interviews and marketing during the promotional tour distasteful, and responded organically to that, which the media themselves picked up on\".",
      "Overall, Freedman called Lively's complaint \"shameful\" and full of \"categorically false accusations\".",
      "In recent days, Lively has received support from a string of former co-stars and others in Hollywood.",
      "The name of one of her supporters stands out.",
      "Amber Heard, former wife of Johnny Depp, told NBC: \"Social media is the absolute personification of the classic saying, 'A lie travels halfway around the world before truth can get its boots on.'",
      "\"I saw this firsthand and up close. It's as horrifying as it is destructive.\"",
      "Heard was on the receiving end of social media hostility during two high-profile libel trials involving Depp in the UK and US in 2020 and 2022. Nathan also reportedly worked for Depp.",
      "Freedman responded to Heard by saying the only connection between her and Lively was that \"for decades every move they have made has been out there for everyone to see\" so the public could \"make up their own minds - which they did, organically\".",
      "Tortoise Media head of investigations Alexi Mostrous, who hosted a podcast called Who Trolled Amber? earlier this year examining the abuse she received, said there were parallels.",
      "\"In both the Blake Lively case and the Amber Heard case, you see PR companies working with digital media specialists and other 'contractors' to promote online stories beneficial to their wealthy clients in ways that are opaque and not well understood,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It's an unregulated world where all sorts of tactics can take place behind closed doors.\"",
      "'Common tactic'",
      "Variety said Lively's case \"lays bare a show business process that's meant to operate in the shadows \u2013 the hiring of expensive crisis communications experts to sway opinion and uplift clients\".",
      "Her allegations suggest a \"sinister shadow campaign\" that went \"beyond what most publicity firms in Hollywood see as acceptable\", The Wrap's Sharon Waxman wrote.",
      "According to Rory Lynch, partner and head of reputation management law at Gateley Legal, it is \"quite a common tactic\" in Hollywood and business disputes to \"have PRs on both sides planting negative stories, sometimes false stories, about the opposition\".",
      "\"Even back in the golden era of Hollywood, there were rumours that Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were using PR professionals to negatively brief against each other.\"",
      "However, the PR people who worked for Baldoni and his studio \"dropped the ball a little bit\" by discussing tactics in texts, he told BBC News.",
      "\"It doesn't surprise me, especially in the US and Hollywood, that you've got quite aggressive crisis PR people.",
      "\"But the fact that they put that in writing, I think, was possibly not the wisest thing. Normally they might do something like that over the phone.\"",
      "Lively herself is \"a sophisticated operator\" who will \"have her own PR people working away in the background as well\", Lynch added.",
      "'Our eyes are open'",
      "The New York Times, which broke the story of Lively's complaint at the weekend, said she \"denied that she or any of her representatives planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer\".",
      "The paper also pointed out that \"it is impossible to know how much of the negative publicity\" towards Lively was originally seeded by those working on behalf of Baldoni, \"and how much they noticed and amplified\".",
      "Some fans have stressed that their criticisms were genuine, but many who turned against Lively now see the situation in a different light.",
      "\"We are so able to be manipulated into hating a woman that all it takes is a co-ordinated PR effort for us to switch sides against a domestic abuse victim, or a long-beloved American sweetheart,\" wrote Maddy Mussen in the Standard.",
      "\"Now our eyes are open, will we be harder to fool? Or will we still want any excuse to turn on a famous woman who is suddenly, in our eyes and the eyes of the ones manipulating us, no longer worthy?\"",
      "The Guardian's Laura Snapes wrote that she and her friends had now \"looked back, horrified, on what we had said about her in recent months\".",
      "She added: \"Lively's complaint has left my head spinning. What can you really trust?\""

      "Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos has found fatherhood a familiar experience \u2013 as it reminds him of his band's early days.",
      "Kapranos and wife Clara Luciani welcomed their first child last year, and the 52-year-old told BBC Scotland News departing on tours with his band is now \"really difficult.\"",
      "\"Saying goodbye to him is hard,\" says the singer, speaking as his band prepare to release their sixth album, The Human Fear, in January.",
      "\"I've spent my adult life shirking responsibility, and being as irresponsible as possible, so being presented with responsibility is quite refreshing.",
      "\"A lot of people said to me that sleep deprivation would destroy me, but it was just like 2004 when the band was kicking off and I never went to bed.",
      "\"We'd be playing gigs, going out all night and then be up at 6am to fly somewhere. I slept about two hours a night back then, so this is the same - just without a hangover.\"",
      "Kapranos will be forced to say goodbye on a few occasions as 2025 goes on, with a busy year in store for Franz \u2013 now revamped and reformatted since those early days, but still adept at writing artful indie pop.",
      "Emerging from Glasgow's bustling music scene Kapranos, guitarist Nick McCarthy, bassist Bob Hardy and drummer Paul Thomson enjoyed chart success with inescapable singles like Take Me Out, earned a reputation as one of the country's finest live acts and snagged the Mercury Music Prize in 2004.",
      "That victory came as the band thought \"anyone but us would win,\" recalls the singer.",
      "\"It's quite a Glasgow attitude. You're like 'we're not the sort of people who win prizes'.\"",
      "Success had taken time to arrive.",
      "Kapranos was born in England but moved to to Scotland as a child. As a teenager he became entrenched in the 90s Glasgow music scene, running club nights and playing in the likes of cult indie band the Yummy Fur before forming Franz Ferdinand.",
      "Much has changed since their debut album won the Mercury, with The Human Fear marking the group's first studio offering since the exit of original drummer Thomson in 2021.",
      "Guitarist McCarthy had left in 2016.",
      "A new line-up has formed around original members Kapranos and Hardy, with guitarist Dino Bardot, keyboardist/guitarist Julian Corrie and drummer Audrey Tait joining up.",
      "Kapranos believes the band's identity is intact despite the changes.",
      "\"Whenever we do a cover it always sounds like us, and I like that.  We did Good Luck Babe [by Chappell Roan] on Radio 2, which is an amazing song but when we play it, it just sounds like Franz Ferdinand.",
      "\"Bob and I were talking about this before we made this record, that it's good to be at ease with your identity and your sound.",
      "\"Knowing your voice and who you are is important. You could listen to early Birthday Party records and then those dark sombre ballads Nick Cave has been writing now, and it's still unmistakeably him -it's the same for PJ Harvey or Leonard Cohen.",
      "\"That really informed us making this record.  I wanted people to listen to this and know it's unmistakeably Franz Ferdinand.\"",
      "A greatest hits compilation in 2021 and ensuing tour helped the singer make \"peace with everything that we've done before\".",
      "\"I'm not the kinda person who likes to look back,\" he adds.",
      "\"Once we make a record I never really listen to it again, so for the tour I was being forced to listen to that music again, and I found I felt pretty comfortable with it.\"",
      "Celebrating the past meant the band were also eager to try new things for the future.",
      "The Human Fear is filled with ideas fresh to the group, from orchestral flourishes on recent single Audacious to a bouzouki being used on Black Eyelashes and the Celtic style riff pulsing through Cats.",
      "Exhilaration of fear",
      "However, while the title might suggest a record bubbling with dread, Kapranos says it's about the opposite.",
      "\"The greatest moments in life are when you overcome fear,\" he says, admitting his own childhood terror was the shark in Jaws.",
      "\"Watching horror films or riding rollercoasters gives you a buzz and we should maybe approach some wider existential fears with the same attitude.",
      "\"I remember growing up in the 80s and thinking one diplomatic slip-up would mean we'd all be nuclear toast. There's always something to be afraid of, and you can either submit to it or stand up to it.\"",
      "'Loathe' to write about politics again",
      "Politics is something Franz Ferdinand have visited before. In 2014 they backed Scottish independence and two years later they released Demagogue, aimed at the then incoming American President Donald Trump.",
      "However the second Presidency of Trump is unlikely to spur such a similiar reaction.",
      "\"Trump's not my favourite man and there's so much in worldwide politics that's disheartening,\" says the singer.",
      "\"But it's also disheartening how everyone is going on about politics all the time.  I find it wearying and I'm loathe to do my share of it. It should be obvious Trump is an idiot and self-centred, does it need me to say that?",
      "\"Some of my friends on social media just bang on about it all the time. The arts is a powerful tool of protest and we should continue to do that, but there's a difference between that and low key whinging.\"",
      "They won't remain silent on some issues, though.",
      "In 2024 the group were among Scottish musicians raising concerns over possible arts funding cuts, while a short tour saw them road-test new songs in some of the country's smaller venues.",
      "UK dates for 2025 include the larger likes of the Barrowland in Glasgow, with a summer show at the city's SWG3 also booked in, but supporting grassroots music remains a passionate subject for the singer.",

      "Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC on Saturday that the allegations are \"categorically false\".",

      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni: What you need to know",
      "Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as \"honest, kind, supportive and patient\".",
      "Lawyers for Ms Lively say the legal complaint follows a meeting earlier this year to address \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\" by Baldoni, her co-star and a producer on the movie.",
      "In their statement, Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel said:  \"As Blake's friends and sisters for over 20 years, we stand with her in solidarity as she fights back against the reported campaign waged to destroy her reputation.",
      "\"Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice.\"",
      "They added: \"Most upsetting is the unabashed exploitation of domestic violence survivors' stories to silence a woman who asked for safety. The hypocrisy is astounding.",
      "\"We are struck by the reality that even if a woman is as strong, celebrated, and resourced as our friend Blake, she can face forceful retaliation for daring to ask for a safe working environment,\" the statement added.",
      "\"We are inspired by our sister's courage to stand up for herself and others.\"",

      "\"Thank you for being exactly the human that you are.",
      "\"Never change. Never wilt.\"",
      "She then linked to a New York Times article titled We Can Bury Anyone: Inside A Hollywood Smear Machine.",
      "Hoover also re-posted the statement from Ferrara, Bledel and Tamblyn, adding: \"This statement from these women and Blake's ability to refuse to sit down and 'be buried' has been nothing short of inspiring.\"",
      "The meeting between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni, together with others involved in the movie's production plus Ms Lively's actor husband Ryan Reynolds, took place on 4 January 2024, and it aimed to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set, according to Ms Lively's legal filing.",
      "Mr Baldoni attended the meeting in his capacity as co-chairman and co-founder of the company that produced the film, Wayfarer Studios. He was also the film's director.",
      "In the legal complaint, Ms Lively's lawyers allege that both Mr Baldoni and the Wayfarer chief executive officer, Jamey Heath, engaged in \"inappropriate and unwelcome behaviour towards Ms Lively and others on the set of It Ends With Us\".",
      "In the filing to the California Civil Rights Department, a list of 30 demands relating to the pair's alleged misconduct was made at the meeting to ensure they could continue to produce the film.",
      "Among them, Ms Lively requested that there be no more mention of Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath's previous \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively or to other crew members, no more descriptions of their own genitalia to Ms Lively, and \"no more adding of sex scenes, oral sex, or on camera climaxing by BL [Blake Lively] outside the scope of the script BL approved when signing onto the project\", says the complaint.",
      "Ms Lively also demanded that Mr Baldoni stop saying he could speak to her dead father.",
      "Ms Lively's legal team further accuse Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios of leading a \"multi-tiered plan\" to wreck her reputation.",
      "She alleges this was \"the intended result of a carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others from speaking out about the hostile environment that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath created\".",
      "Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\"",
      "Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "He alleged that Ms Lively's claims were \"intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media\".",
      "In a statement via her attorneys to the BBC, Ms Lively said: \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\"",
      "She also denied that she or any of her representatives had planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer.",
      "The film was a box-office hit, although some critics said it romanticised domestic violence."

      "He pleaded guilty in May to a charge of smuggling cannabis relating to 11 July 2023, and supplying cannabis between 26 October 2022 and 21 February 2024.",
      "However, during a trial of the issue, known as a Newton Hearing, at Lincoln Crown Court, the 24-year-old denied importing up to 60kg (132lbs) of cannabis for commercial sale.",
      "The two-day hearing has been held in front of Judge Simon Hirst, who will decide on the level of Herbert's drug dealing after the prosecution did not accept the basis of his pleas.",
      "Giving evidence via a video link from HMP Wormwood Scrubs, where he is currently on remand, the rapper said he began using cannabis from the age of 12 and used the drug throughout his teenage years to \"help with his frequent migraines\".",
      "The court heard it was \"a benefit\" for Herbert to buy his cannabis in bulk as he could afford it and it proved cheaper.",
      "His defence barrister, James Scobie KC, previously told the court the artist had earnings in excess of \u00a33m at the time of the alleged large-scale drug dealing activity.",
      "On Tuesday, prosecutors suggested a message on Herbert's phone referring to \"40 in the air\" was in relation to the importation of about 18kg (635oz) of cannabis.",
      "Herbert told the court it was a \"fictional chat\" and said he had no knowledge of 18kg coming into the country at that time.",
      "He said he also obtained bags of cannabis to use in the video for his hit song I'm From.",
      "The musician said buying in bulk also reduced the chance of him coming to the attention of the police as he was often stopped both in London and elsewhere in the country.",
      "The trial was previously told the 24-year-old was a heavy user of cannabis and had supplied socially to others in the music industry including his entourage.",
      "He was also supplying to three people who lived with him at his address in Bracebridge Heath, near Lincoln.",
      "However, prosecutors claim he was involved in commercial transactions of up to 60kg.",
      "Mr Scobie said the artist was selling about 5kg (11lbs) of the Class B drug on a \"sporadic\" commercial basis - making a small profit of \u00a3300-\u00a3400 on each deal.",
      "The court heard two sets of weighing scales and a cannabis grinder were recovered from Herbert's London home on Lonsdale Road in Notting Hill, where he lived with his mother.",
      "Mobile phone footage of the star handling a bag of cannabis and allegedly complaining about the poor quality was played to the judge.",
      "A number of photographs also showed Herbert handling large amounts of cash, the prosecution claimed.",

      "The attractions were part of the world's first art funfair - Luna Luna - dreamed up by little-known Austrian creative Andr\u00e9 Heller in the 1970s, featuring a carousel by Keith Haring, a Ferris wheel by Jean-Michel Basquiat and a David Hockney pavilion.",

      "A successful attraction for months, plans for a grand European tour formed - but when they later fell through, an extensive legal battle ensued and the rides were shut down, disassembled and packed away, forgotten.",
      "Until now.",
      "Luna Luna is unwrapped",
      "American entrepreneur Michael Goldberg stumbled across Luna Luna on an art blog. He'd never heard of it, despite some of the art world's biggest names contributing. Neither, to his surprise, had his friends in the industry.",
      "\"Everyone asked me what I was talking about,\" he said. \"Something seemed a little odd.\"",
      "'In love' with the fair, Goldberg wrote to Heller, introducing himself and proposing a new iteration of the Austrian's original dream.",
      "The two slowly built a rapport and Heller revealed that the attractions had been stored in 44 shipping containers in Austin, Texas since their disassembly.",
      "Opening in 1987, Luna Luna was a colourful success for three months. Its run was extended twice due to high demand, but while trying to fund a European tour, Heller fell into debt and sold the fair to an American foundation.",
      "The foundation tried to back out of the deal - \"buyers remorse\", according to Goldberg - but eventually went through with it. For the duration of the years-long battle and the new ownership, however, the rides were kept in storage.",
      "Decades since Luna Luna was packed away, Goldberg rallied a team of investors to buy what might be left of the exhibition from the foundation - sight unseen.",
      "His key investor? Global rap star Drake, via his investment and entertainment business DreamCrew.",
      "\"The idea of restoring something so rich in cultural history outweighed the risks and for us, it wasn't about guarantees,\" Anthony Gonzales, CEO of DreamCrew, told the BBC.",
      "The New York Times estimated they paid $100m (about \u00a380m). The Guardian reported the sum at $1m. Goldberg did not disclose the final price to the BBC.",
      "When he opened the first of the containers, Goldberg started to sweat. Luna Luna's original merchandise had been torn to shreds.",
      "\"Did I just lead a group to spend millions of dollars on a pile of dust artwork that essentially rotted away?\" he wondered.",
      "It was a sleepless night.",
      "But the next day, as more paper was removed from a second container, the light caught a toffee-apple-red handlebar to Haring's carousel, then the white floorboards of  Basquiat's Ferris wheel, which \"could have been painted days ago\". It was a moment of \"instant relief\", said Goldberg.",

      "\"It was like a giant Lego with no instruction kit,\" he said.",
      "A crew of artists, carnival technicians, curators and architects worked together to meticulously rebuild Luna Luna for two years before its grand reopening in LA this March.",
      "Now, Luna Luna: Forgotten Fantasy has come to a Midtown Manhattan art and theatre complex, The Shed. The fair is on display alongside exhibits detailing its surreal curation process.",
      "Alex Poots, creative co-founder of The Shed, described the journey as a \"Raiders of the Lost Ark story\", in reference to the film, praising Heller's ability to commission artists of such high calibre while finding a format appealing to \"art lovers and yet to be art lovers.\"",
      "\"That is a holy grail kind of pursuit,\" he added.",
      "Most of the original rides are now housed in a towering 17,000-square foot space. There, exhibition-goers can \"marry\" one another in Heller's Wedding Chapel - originally a form of protest art against anti-LGBTQ marriage laws of the 80s.",
      "Hockney's Enchanted Tree Pavilion still smells faintly sweet, as if stampeding children once crushed fallen popcorn into its floor.",
      "Goldberg's wish to incorporate \"today's greatest artists\" is fulfilled with a soundtrack by modern musicians Andr\u00e9 3000, Jamie xx and Jockstrap echoing around the space.",
      "Drake isn't involved day-to-day but, \"he is passionate about Luna Luna and has provided his full support since the beginning,\" Gonzales said.",
      "All the fun of the fair?",
      "There's one big difference between 1987's Luna Luna and today's: Children aren't allowed on the rides.",
      "Basquiat's Ferris Wheel and Kenny Scharf's swing ride are display-only. So too (thankfully) is Manfred Deix's Palace of the Winds in which performers originally farted into microphones.",
      "Haring biographer Gooch doesn't think the artist would have approved of children just watching his carousel turn.",
      "\"I can't imagine he would allow it,\" he said. \"He was pretty insistent about interactivity of children with art, and this was art that was specifically made for them.\"",
      "Poots, who played a significant role in coordinating the interdisciplinary side of the exhibition said of the decision: \"They're priceless works of art now.\"",
      "But he champions the possibility of audiences becoming \"part of this moving exhibition\" through the \"carnival-esque environment with performance artists with light, with sound\".",
      "It has been a career-long mission of Poots not \"to create these silos for elites\".",
      "He added that ticket prices, criticised by some as being too high, are \"pretty reasonable\" as the show cost \"millions and millions of dollars to install\".",
      "Among the families wandering around The Shed on Thanksgiving weekend were Raemy Suwatson and her 11-year-old daughter, who learned she wouldn't be able to go on the rides the morning of their visit.",
      "Haring's carousel was her favourite. \"I wanted to ride it\" she said, then added \"but it was also cool to watch\".",
      "The show is running from 20 November to 23 February, and will tour after it leaves The Shed."

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 22:06:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Over the centuries, painters in India have depicted Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.",
    "story": [
      "The birth of Jesus Christ - a seminal biblical event - has been the subject of many paintings by Western artists, who have often applied the ideas of beauty and creativity prevalent there while depicting the event on canvas.",
      "These works are among the most widely available representations of Christian art, shaping how the world views this biblical event and subliminally divesting those outside the West from influencing it.",
      "But over the centuries, artists in India have sought to express their vision of this event by painting Jesus's birth and other Christian themes in their own style.",
      "Some have done so consciously, others unconsciously, but the end result is a body of work that breathes new life and meaning into the event of Christ's birth, and Christianity itself.",
      "Here are some paintings from Indian art history that present Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.",
      "Mughal emperor Muhammad Jalaluddin Akbar is credited with introducing northern India to Christianity by inviting Jesuit missionaries to visit his court.",
      "The missionaries brought with them holy scriptures and European artworks on Christian themes which influenced court painters. Akbar and his successors also commissioned many murals with Christian themes and some court painters began infusing these paintings with elements of Islamic art.",
      "Neha Vermani, a historian of South Asia, talks about a painting made by Mughal court artists which featured emperor Jahangir in the nativity scene, which traditionally feature Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus.",
      "\"Mughal rulers saw themselves as being 'just' rulers, capable of maintaining harmony and balance in their kingdoms; they were 'universal rulers'. Allowing different religions to co-exist was integral to how they saw themselves and wanted themselves to be remembered,\" Ms Vermani says.",
      "The 18th Century painting below features typical stylistic elements of Mughal art, including highly stylised figures, vibrant colours, naturalism and ornamentation.",
      "Born in 1887 in what is now India's West Bengal state, Jamini Roy is celebrated for creating a unique visual language by bringing together elements of Bengali folk art and Kalighat paintings - a distinctive art form that originated in the vicinity of a renowned temple in Kolkata city.",
      "Ashish Anand, CEO and managing director of art firm DAG says that art critic WG Archer once observed that Christ represented a Santhal figure (the Santhals are an Indian tribal group) for Jamini Roy.",
      "\"The simplicity of Christ's life and his sacrifice appealed to Roy, making his paintings on Christian themes at least as important as those on Hindu mythology, all of them rendered in the folk style of modernism that he made distinctively his own,\" he says.",
      "Born in 1902 in the western state of Goa, Angelo de Fonseca is credited with creating unique Christian iconography that married Eastern and Western influences with his Goan sensibilities.",
      "In his paintings, Mary isn't depicted as a fair maiden in a blue gown, but looks very much like an Indian woman with brown skin, dressed in a sari and wearing a mangalsutra (a piece of traditional Indian jewellery worn by married Hindu women).",
      "Biblical scenes unfold in local settings and feature motifs and elements that speak to an Indian audience.",
      "Through his art, he tried to counter the narrative of the West being the cradle of beauty and artistic creativity.",
      "\"Fonseca wanted to situate Christianity - which has largely been viewed as a western religious tradition - within the Indian subcontinent. It was from this angst that his watercolours painted Christianity anew,\" Rinald D'Souza, director of the Xavier Centre of Historical Research, Goa, told the BBC."

      "There are few books in recent years that have become as big a cultural phenomenon    as Colleen Hoover's novel - it has sold 20m copies and became an internet sensation on TikTok with more than one billion tags on the app.",
      "When Blake Lively, who rose to fame in the 2000s playing Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, was cast as the main character, fans became even more excited, describing her as the perfect choice to play Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and winds up in the same position years later.",
      "Lily, a florist in Boston, navigates a complicated love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend Ryle Kincaid - played by Jane the Virgin's Justin Baldoni - and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar).",
      "Released at the beginning of August, the film became a box office success bringing in more than $350m (\u00a3280m) globally.",
      "But despite its financial success, everything wasn't running so smoothly behind the scenes. Rumours of a feud between Baldoni and Lively began swirling before the film was even released.",
      "Last week, Lively filed a legal complaint against her co-star, accusing him of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against her, something Baldoni strongly denies. Here is the story so far:",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Blake Lively accuses co-star Justin Baldoni of smear campaign",
      "It Ends With Us press tour",
      "For a film about domestic abuse, the press tour for It Ends With Us was probably not what you would have expected. There were pink carpets, flowers galore and the promotion of Lively's new haircare brand and her husband's gin company.",
      "Instead of advocacy on the red carpet, Lively highlighted fashion and florals.",
      "At the London premiere, press were told to keep questions \"fun and light-hearted\" with one event organiser telling me to \"steer away from questions on domestic abuse\".",
      "One of her remarks made at the New York premiere - \"you are so much more than just a survivor or just a victim\" - sparked backlash on social media.",
      "Domestic abuse survivor Ashley Paige criticised Ms Lively's language and told the BBC that her own trauma \"shaped my identity\".",
      "Lively was also criticised for her comments in another clumsy promotional tour video where she said: \"Grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see it.\"",
      "Ms Paige accused Lively of promoting the film like it's \"the sequel to Barbie\".",
      "Justin Baldoni's absence",
      "Alongside the press tour being described as \"tone-deaf\", people started asking questions about why the Lively and Baldoni weren't photographed on the red carpet together at the film's New York premiere on 6 August.",
      "The pair also did no interviews together during the press tour and at the London premiere, which Baldoni didn't attend, I was warned by Lively's team to not \"ask any questions about Justin\".",
      "Internet sleuths also spotted that cast members including Lively and author Hoover did not follow Baldoni on social media.",
      "Neither Lively or Baldoni addressed rumours of a feud during the press tour and the only reference to each other was Baldoni telling Today that his co-star was a \"dynamic creative\".",
      "\"She had her hands in every part of this production, and everything she touched made [it] better,\" he said about the 37-year-old.",
      "Mixed critic reviews",
      "While the film was a box office success, it received mixed reviews from critics with some saying it romanticised domestic abuse.",
      "There was a two-star review from The Telegraph's Tim Robey, who called it a \"queasy drama\" that \"repackages domestic violence as slick romance\".",
      "He suggested the film \"splices abuse and glossy courtship in the big city to deeply dubious effects\".",
      "The movie also sparked a debate on TikTok, with some saying that it's not clear from the trailer that this story is about an abusive relationship and rather it appears to be telling a love story.",
      "Based on this misconception, some people said they found the film traumatic as they didn't know it contained scenes of domestic abuse.",
      "'Smear campaign'",
      "During the film's press tour, Baldoni hired a crisis manager, Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake.",
      "Shortly after the press tour, Lively faced a barrage of criticism on social media relating to her comments on that tour as well as from old interviews.",
      "One of the interviews to resurface was one shared by a Norwegian journalist, Kjersti Flaa, who posted a video on YouTube of her interviewing Lively in 2016. It was titled \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\"",
      "Flaa has since said she had \"nothing to do with Justin Baldoni and his smear campaign\".",
      "Actor Brandon Sklenar, who plays Atlas in the film, defended Lively and said in a post on Instagram that people had been \"vilifying\" the women involved in the film online.",
      "He said it was \"disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected\" and that someone close to him who had experienced a relationship similar to Lily's had credited the film with \"saving her life\".",
      "Legal complaint",
      "Four months after the film's launch, Lively filed a legal complaint against Mr Baldoni in which she accused him of sexual harassment.",
      "The complaint also listed Wayfarer Studios, Mr Baldoni's production company which produced It Ends With Us, as a defendant.",
      "The legal filing accuses Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer CEO Jamey Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\". Some other female cast and crew had also spoken up about their conduct, the filing alleges.",
      "It also alleges that Ms Lively, Mr Baldoni and other people involved in the development of the film attended a meeting in January to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set. Her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, attended the meeting alongside her, according to the complaint.",
      "At the meeting, attendees agreed to a list of demands, including Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath making \"no more descriptions of their own genitalia\", requiring an intimacy coordinator on set at all times when Ms Lively was in scenes with Mr Baldoni and no \"friends\" of the producers and directors being on set during scenes when Ms Lively was in a state of nudity.",
      "The list of demands also implied that Mr Baldoni had asked Ms Lively's trainer how much she weighed and alleged that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath had spoken about their \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively.",
      "Plan to 'destroy' reputation",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively also alleges that Mr Baldoni and his team attacked her public image after the meeting.",
      "She accuses him of orchestrating a plan to \"destroy\" her reputation in the press and online, including hiring a crisis manager who led a \"sophisticated, coordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" against her and used a \"digital army\" to post social media content that seemed authentic.",
      "\"To safeguard against the risk of Ms Lively ever revealing the truth about Mr Baldoni, the Baldoni-Wayfarer team created, planted, amplified, and boosted content designed to eviscerate Ms Lively's credibility,\" her team wrote in the filing.",
      "It adds: \"They engaged in the same techniques to bolster Mr Baldoni's credibility and suppress any negative content about him.\"",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively says that this had led to \"substantial harm\" that affected \"all aspects\" of her life.",
      "Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.",
      "Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\"",
      "Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "Support for Lively",
      "Hollywood stars including America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel have publicly backed Blake Lively after she filed her complaint.",
      "Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel, who starred with Lively in 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, issued a joint statement on Instagram, on Sunday saying they \"stand with her in solidarity\".",
      "\"Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice,\" they wrote.",
      "Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as \"honest, kind, supportive and patient\".",
      "Baldoni's award rescinded",
      "Earlier in December, Baldoni was awarded a women's solidarity honour by Vital Voices, a global non-profit organisation that focuses on empowering women.",
      "The organisation has now rescinded the award after the legal complaint filed by Lively alleged \"abhorrent conduct\" by the actor, his studio and a crisis public relations team that it said was \"contrary to the values\" it held.",
      "And since the legal complaint, Baldoni's podcast co-host Liz Plank announced she was leaving The Man Enough show.",
      "The podcast bills itself as creating \"a safe environment\" for exploring issues such as how \"masculinity\" shows up in relationships, as well as \"sex, success\" and \"mental health\".",

    "summary": "After dominating culture this summer, Brat tops a \"poll of polls\" to be named the year's best record.",
    "story": [
      "When Charli XCX recorded her sixth album, Brat, she thought her prickly, abrasive dance anthems were \"not going to appeal to a lot of people\".",
      "In the end, the record topped the charts and became a cultural phenomenon. It was nominated for seven Grammys, referenced in the US presidential election, turned into a paint swatch, and named \"word of the year\" by Collins Dictionary.",
      "Now the album has been named the best new release of 2024 in a \"poll of polls\" compiled by BBC News.",
      "In multiple end of year lists, critics called Brat \"brilliant from start to finish\" and \"pop music for the future\", praising the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's insecurities, anxieties and obsessions.",
      "In the star's own words, the record is \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "\"The louder you play it, the more honest it gets,\" said the Los Angeles Times.",
      "The BBC's poll is a \"super-ranking\" compiled from 30 year-end lists published by the world's most influential music magazines - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Spain's Mondo Sonoro and France's Les Inrockuptibles.",
      "Records were assigned points based on their position in each list - with the number one album getting 20 points, the number two album receiving 19 points, and so on.",
      "Brat was the runaway winner with a score of 486 points, nearly twice as many as the number two album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter.",
      "In total, the critics named 184 records among their favourites, from the The Cure's long-awaited comeback, Songs Of A Lost World, to the kaleidoscopic rap of Doechii's Alligator Bites Never Heal.",
      "Here's the top 25 in full.",
      "1) Charli XCX - Brat",
      "Charli was born Emma Aitchison in Essex, UK, and has been chipping away at the coalface of pop for more than a decade.",
      "At the start of her career, she scored hits with shiny pop anthems such as Fancy, I Love It and Boom Clap - but over the years, her music has become more volatile and aggressive.",
      "Underground anthems like Vroom, Vroom and Track 10 turned her into a cult star but, as she confessed on Brat: \"I've started thinking again about whether I deserve commercial success\".",
      "With that in mind, she entered 2024 with a new sense of purpose.",
      "\"Before we'd even done much writing, she had a masterplan of all the stuff she wanted to write about, and all the things she wanted to say,\" producer AG Cook tells the BBC. \"She had a real vision for the album, right from the start.\"",
      "\"Even the name Brat was in play for about two years,\" adds co-producer Finn Keane.",
      "Released in June, Brat became the soundtrack to the summer; and Charli extended her success with a remix album that rewrote many of the songs and added an array of guest stars, from Billie Eilish and Robyn to The 1975 and Lorde.",
      "The remix project was \"really, off-the-cuff and last minute\", says Cook, \"but that's been part of the fun of Brat\".",
      "\"Charli is just incredibly quick and open to ideas,\" adds Keane. \"You can give her kind of any kind of crazy track, and she'll instantly be able to come up with something super hooky, with a twist that's very memorable and elaborate.",
      "\"She's just incredibly musical.\"",
      "Billboard: \"Charli XCX pulled off one of the most exciting and culturally significant album launches in modern memory... And best of all? It was all on Charli's own terms. Drawing inspiration primarily from club culture and hyperpop, Charli pulled once-niche spaces in music into the mainstream.\"",
      "The Forty Five: \"In making a club record to ignite the underground, she's reached the world's biggest stages. Musically, Charli is at her peak.\"",
      "2) Beyonc\u00e9 - Cowboy Carter",
      "Frequently mis-labelled as a country album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter is so much more. A racial reckoning with the black roots of American folk music, its 27 tracks embrace everything from line-dancing to psychedelic rock, with guest appearances from Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Post Malone.",
      "The Times: \"The pop hoedown single Texas Hold 'Em remains the best piece, but the acoustic guitar-driven sexy ode Bodyguard is another highlight. Will this finally win Beyonc\u00e9 her best album Grammy?\"",
      "NME: \"A masterclass in creativity from an artist who never forgets her roots.\"",
      "3) Fontaines D.C. - Romance",
      "The fourth album by Dublin's Fontaines DC saw the quintet take their scratchy, sinister sound and run it through a technicolor filter. The results include everything from stadium-sized sing-alongs (Favourite) to panic-inducing punk anthems (Starburster).",
      "Allmusic: \"When all is said and done, they remain fantastic songwriters, able to convey a variety of emotions without relying on the trappings of punk. The corners may have been sanded off, but it has only revealed new and interesting textures underneath.\"",
      "Mojo magazine: \"Fontaines D.C. are now, in terms of risk-taking potential, the Arctic Monkeys' closest rivals.\"",
      "4) Billie Eilish - Hit Me Hard And Soft",
      "The title says it all. None of the songs on Billie Eilish's exquisite third album are content to sit still, moving from hushed intimacy to emotional volatility as the singer navigates the murky waters of her early 20s.",
      "The Telegraph: \"Eilish has made something rich, strange, smart, sad and wise enough to stand comparison with Joni Mitchell's Blue. A heartbreak masterpiece for her generation, and for the ages.\"",
      "The Guardian: \"An album that keeps wrongfooting the listener, Hit Me Hard and Soft is clearly intended as something to gradually unpick: A bold move in a pop world where audiences are usually depicted as suffering from an attention deficit that requires instant gratification.\"",
      "5) MJ Lenderman - Manning Fireworks",
      "Billed by one publication as the \"poet laureate of indie rock\", MJ Lenderman's breakthrough album is tender, melancholy and wryly funny, populated by a cast of flawed, disappointed and disappointing characters he observed around his hometown of Asheville, North Carolina.",
      "New York Times: \"An ace guitarist with a keen ear for jangly tones, he lends even his most pathetic characters a bit of warm-blooded humanity.\"",
      "The Line Of Best Fit: \"How he gets you to care about nobodies from nowhere and their very strange plights is in part to do with his knack for universal empathy, but more importantly, the fact that he sings everything like he was just robbed at gunpoint by his 8th grade bully who he later watched win the lottery. You feel bad for things you don't necessarily even understand.\"",
      "6) The Cure - Songs Of A Lost World",
      "Sixteen years in the making, The Cure's 14th studio album didn't disappoint. Written during a period where frontman Robert Smith lost his mother, father and brother, it is simultaneously dark and fragile.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Smith said making the record had been \"hugely cathartic\" in escaping the \"doom and gloom\" he felt.",
      "Time magazine: \"It's no exaggeration that this is an album haunted by death, so it's almost ironic that, musically speaking, there hasn't been this much life in The Cure for decades.\"",
      "Pitchfork: \"It feels like a record whose time is right, delivering a concentrated dose of The Cure and cutting the fat that dogged their later albums.\"",
      "7) Cindy Lee - Diamond Jubilee",
      "A sprawling, two-hour opus of dreamy pop and psychedelia, this is one of the year's most mysterious records. You can't buy the CD or vinyl, and it's not available on Spotify or Apple Music. At the time of writing, it's only available as a continuous, ad-free stream on YouTube, or as a download from Bandcamp.",
      "But the seventh album by Cyndi Lee (the drag alter-ego of rock musician Patrick Flegel) is definitely worth your seeking out - like the lost transmissions of a ghostly 1960s pirate radio station.",
      "Uncut: \"Cindy Lee has managed to buck just about every trend, convention and expectation of what releasing music in the digital age is supposed to look and like. And, even more crucially, it sounds just as refreshing.\"",
      "Stereogum: \"Diamond Jubilee is two hours of unrushed wandering through a lo-fi escape, catchy to the point of sticky, tarnishing in its abrasiveness yet sun-baked to perfection.\"",
      "8) Waxahatchee - Tigers Blood",
      "On her sixth album as Waxahatchee, singer-songwriter Katie Crutchfield tackles everything from anxiety and self-doubt, to her ongoing struggle with sobriety, with piercing insight and a laid-back country-rock feel.",
      "Pitchfork: \"Her mind is alive and humming, and her language leaps out at you with its hunger.\"",
      "Consequence of Sound: \"Crutchfield is still growing, both personally and artistically, and we're just glad she's invited us along for the ride.\"",
      "9) Kendrick Lamar - GNX",
      "After landing the decisive blow in his rap beef with Drake, Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar took a victory lap on his surprise sixth album, GNX. Razor sharp and rhythmically complex, it's both a poison pen letter to his detractors, and a love letter to Los Angeles' hip-hop culture.",
      "LA Times: \"Lamar is worked up about liars, about folks doling out backhanded compliments, about other rappers with \"old-ass flows\" wasting space with empty rhymes. Indeed, what seems to make him angriest is the idea that a person could triumph in hip-hop by taking hip-hop less seriously than he does.\"",
      "Complex: \"Even cooler is how much space Kendrick gives to underground rappers from the LA scene\u2014figures who are talented but raw, and would likely struggle to gain national recognition without a boost.\"",
      "10) Sabrina Carpenter - Short N' Sweet",
      "Six albums into her career, former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter landed on a winning formula - one that puts aside the cookie-cutter pop of her teen years, and zeroes in on her sly humour as a USP.",
      "Fleet of foot and packed with memorable one-liners, it produced three number one singles in the UK, including song of the year contender Espresso.",
      "New York Times: \"A smart, funny, cheerfully merciless catalogue of bad boyfriend behaviour.\"",
      "Esquire: \"The range, humour, and sophistication of these 12 songs were a revelation.\"",
      "The next 15",

    "title": "'It's bragging without the selfie' - The rise of Spotify Wrapped and its copycats",
    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 18:03:28 GMT",
    "summary": "From Monzo and Duolingo to Trainline and Sainsbury's, companies have hopped onto the year in review bandwagon following the success of Spotify Wrapped",
    "story": [
      "Throughout December, Instagram feeds are flooded with pictures of Christmas trees, snaps from festive work parties \u2013 and screenshots of people's most-listened-to songs of the year.",
      "That's because at the end of every year, since 2016, Spotify releases Wrapped. The campaign pulls together what users listened to the most and usually includes their top songs, artists, and genres.",
      "It's now \"plastered across every possible social media platform known to man,\" says Dr Gillian Brooks, a senior lecturer in strategic marketing at King's College London.",
      "She says its Wrapped feature works so well because music is personal and people enjoy the nostalgia of seeing the songs that marked their lives over the past year.",
      "Since Wrapped goes viral annually, other businesses have joined in, from language learning app Duolingo to bank Monzo, all creating their own personalised \"year in review\" summaries - alongside other music streaming apps such as Apple Music and Amazon Music.",
      "Prof Jonathan Wilson, a professor of brand strategy and culture at Regent's University London, thinks there is an ulterior motive for people sharing these end-of-year-reviews - especially on apps that people use to track their virtuous activities, like fitness and education.",
      "\"It's like bragging but without the selfie,\" he explains. \"Lots of people don't want to take selfies for various reasons but one of them is that people feel a bit cringe, that it's a bit narcissistic.\"",
      "People share information on social media if it \"enhances the image we wish to portray publicly of who we are and what we want to align ourselves with\", he says.",
      "Apps like Strava will tot up how far you have run or cycled this year, while Duolingo will tell you how many hours you've spent learning another language.",
      "Goodreads provides you with images you can share on social media displaying the books you have read this year, with details about the average page length and your top genres.",
      "\"Data is a really good way to humblebrag, as opposed to actually taking selfies in all of your best clothes surrounded by all of your best people and belongings,\" Prof Wilson adds.",
      "\"It's less like bragging and a bit more evidence-based,\" agrees Prof Caroline Wiertz, a professor in marketing at City, University of London.",
      "Spotify Wrapped is part of the festive calendar",
      "\"This is a thing now in the calendar,\" Prof Wiertz says. \"We wait for the John Lewis Christmas ad, we also wait to receive our Spotify Wrapped.\"",
      "Other brands jumping on the bandwagon include Tesco and Sainsbury's for your favourite groceries, Trainline and Uber for your most frequent journeys, Monzo and Lloyds for your spending habits, Xbox and Nintendo for your gaming.",
      "Prof Wilson tells the BBC this copycat behaviour was inevitable - the prospect of people promoting a company or product seems like too good an opportunity to miss.",
      "As Dr Brooks says: \"It's free advertising for them.\"",
      "Can you remember these 2024 culture moments?",
      "'Barry Island is on the up but it'll never be posh'",
      "Watch: Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr reunite on stage",
      "Some year in review features are more tongue in cheek, which brands hope can make them more relatable, and shareable, to their customers, these experts say.",
      "People typically don't post information about their financial situation on social media. But Monzo has found a way to make its year in review sharable, by telling people whether they're among the top spenders at Greggs.",
      "Reddit tells users the distance they've scrolled, measured in bananas.",
      "And though Prof Wilson says that people typically don't want to post mundane things on social media, like \"which kind of bread roll they bought,\" Sainsbury's shows shoppers whether they were the top buyers of certain products in their local area.",
      "It has led to people boasting online about being the top consumer of paprika, toilet cleaner or pickled gherkins.",
      "Year in review features can raise questions about just how much data companies collect. It is widely understood that the vast majority of apps and websites someone might use are collecting huge reams of data, which they use for marketing purposes.",
      "Dr Brooks suggests \"people blindly accept privacy preferences online\" because they want to get on with whatever they visited the website to do.",
      "Data privacy is \"not as huge of an issue as it used to be\", she says. \"If we get more targeted adverts as a result, most people I've spoken to are okay with that.\"",
      "And though people like to keep some information about themselves private, they seem to have few qualms about sharing their hobbies and leisure activities online.",
      "\"Paradoxically, when you share a selfie you are sharing far less information about yourself than you do with data showing what you do,\" Prof Wilson says. \"People seem more comfortable with doing that than sharing a picture of themselves.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"Even if he is acquitted, it will not leave him. He'll be cancelled for the rest of time,\" Patrick Gibbs KC, defending Slowthai, told the jury.",
      "As the not guilty verdicts were read out by the foreman, the rapper collapsed in tears in the dock - he had just been acquitted of three counts of rape following a three-week-long trial at Oxford Crown Court.",
      "In that moment, most people in that court room, including the rapper's friends and family, were focussed on the relief and joy of those two words - \"not guilty\".",
      "But over the coming weeks, Slowthai - whose real name is Tyron Frampton - will begin to plot a course to overcome his ''cancellation\", and regain his status as one of UK rap music's most celebrated artists.",
      "The rapper released his first album in 2019.",
      "He has since gone on to release two more critically acclaimed albums, including 2023's UGLY - which received a five-star review from the NME's Thomas Smith, who called it the rapper's \"most exhilarating project to date from front to back\".",
      "But soon after the release of his third album, the Grammy-nominated rapper was charged with rape.",
      "He was quickly removed from the line-up of Glastonbury Festival, as well as Reading and Leeds, soon after.",
      "Fast forward 18 months, and he has been cleared of those charges by a jury of his peers - and is now free to re-start his music career.",
      "Marcus Johnstone, who is a criminal defence solicitor specialising in sexual offences, explains: \"Winning a criminal case [and being found not guilty] is often not the end, but the start of the real problem actually.\"",
      "\"Celebrities in particular experience being 'cancelled' when they find themselves accused of a sex crime.\"",
      "\"They go from hero to zero overnight.\"",
      "In predicting how any Slowthai comeback could be received, it may be useful to look at similar cases.",
      "In 2019, JLS star Oritse Williams stood trial accused of raping a woman in his hotel room after a concert in Wolverhampton.",
      "Williams stressed in court that the encounter had been entirely consensual - and was unanimously acquitted after just two hours of jury deliberations.",
      "Two years later, JLS reformed for a 29-date comeback tour that saw the band perform to a more than 350,000 people.",
      "The musician, who has also released his own solo music since being acquitted, has seen his career climb back to, and even possibly exceed, its previous heights since his trial five years ago.",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the English singer-songwriter Rex Orange County.",
      "The musician was widely regarded as a darling of modern indie music, and had released critically acclaimed albums that reached the top ten in both the UK and US charts, before being charged with six counts of sexual assault in 2022.",
      "All charges against him were dropped later that year, but the singer decided to take a two-year hiatus from music - which ended earlier this year with the release of his fifth studio album, The Alexander Technique.",
      "The album has failed to garner anywhere near as much interest as his previous efforts though, spending just one week in the UK album chart and only reaching 151 in the US.",
      "Despite seeing off the charges, Rex Orange County thus far appears to have failed to shake-off his \"cancelled\" tag and reignite his career.",
      "The stories of Oritse Williams and Rex Orange County may guide what Slowthai does next with his career - but only the general public will determine the outcome of his comeback.",
      "Marcus Johnstone says he feels there \"may be some hope\" for the Northampton-based rapper.",
      "\"His attraction is to a certain demographic who may not see the need to 'cancel' him,\" he says.",
      "He adds that Slowthai's future song writing will be \"inspired by what he has endured\".",
      "In his 2021 song CANCELLED, Slowthai asked: \"How you gonna cancel me?\"",
      "\"Said I won't come back, I must be cancer, ain't got much longer, then I made a comeback,\" he rapped on the song.",
      "Slowthai will now be hoping that comeback he predicted in a song three years ago will come to fruition - otherwise he will be left to find out the answer to \"How you gonna cancel me?\".",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 02:22:49 GMT",
    "summary": "The British actress has reunited with Mike Leigh for a film that could score her an Oscar nomination.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly three decades after being nominated for an Oscar, British actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste is back in the awards race thanks to a tremendous performance in director Mike Leigh's new drama, Hard Truths.",
      "The 57-year-old jokes she feels \"older and wider\" (rather than wiser) this time around - a line she credits to co-star Michele Austin, who plays her on-screen sister.",
      "But waistlines aside, her reunion with Leigh, whom she first worked with on 1996's Secrets & Lies, has prompted some of the most positive reviews of her career.",
      "Hard Truths centres on Pansy, a woman who is constantly grumpy and miserable, and the impact her unspoken depression has on those around her.",
      "It would be unfair to call the film a comeback for Jean-Baptiste, because she has been working tirelessly in the intervening years. But her second collaboration with Leigh has led to renewed attention on the film awards circuit.",
      "\"It's kind of a full circle moment, rather than a comeback,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "\"It's very interesting, because the first time, I was not aware at all that we were even in an Oscar race. You've got to remember, in 1996, there was still a huge independent film presence in the United States.",
      "\"At that time, we weren't that aware of the whole Oscar thing. It was something that happened over there,\" she says, gesturing far away, \"with really big stars. So it really was not on our radar.\"",
      "Having won the top prize at Cannes, it was only when Secrets & Lies played at the New York Film Festival four months later that Jean-Baptiste became more aware of the awards buzz. \"I hadn't even heard of the Golden Globes at that point,\" she recalls.",
      "\"We were just talking about the film, doing loads of interviews, we were just knackered from all the plane rides, so there was a naivety to it the first time.",
      "\"Now we have the internet and it's become more of an aggressive pursuit of those awards. The campaigning process has changed quite a lot. Or maybe it hasn't and we just weren't aware of it back then.\"",
      "Leigh and Jean-Baptiste have \"kept in touch over the years\", she explains - which ultimately led to their second project together.",
      "Hard Truths has been praised for its hard-hitting but nuanced depiction of depression and complex family dynamics.",
      "There is humour in many of the scenes as Pansy starts arguments with pretty much everyone she encounters, from her closest relatives to her dentist. The man in the car park who asks if she's leaving gets it with both barrels.",
      "But there is something deeper going on. Although the word \"depression\" isn't mentioned in the film, it's clear Pansy is struggling.",
      "\"Yeah, it's not spoken,\" Jean-Baptiste says. \"And the interesting thing about that is the whole family, everyone that she comes into contact with, other than her sister, just sort of gets on with it.",
      "\"It's under the surface. 'Oh, it's just Pansy.' And so many people live like that, where you have somebody that's really difficult, and nobody says to them, 'Man, what is it? What's really going on?' You just sort of avoid them.\"",
      "On paper, it might sound like fun for an actor to play such a juicy, bad-tempered character. But Jean-Baptiste's performance reveals something much more complex.",
      "\"People have asked if it was cathartic, the chance to just spew. But no, it wasn't like that,\" she says. \"I felt the very real pain, anxiety and fear. There was not a lot of enjoyment to be had in that.",
      "\"And also, Pansy comes from a generation where you're taught to just get on with things. It's like the pre-Oprah generation, self-help - it's before all that. You just went, 'I feel rubbish, but I've got to do the laundry.' You get up and you get on with it.\"",
      "'Raw and realistic'",
      "In her review of Hard Truths, Carla Hay of Culture Mix said Jean-Baptiste \"gives a fierce and complex performance\", describing it as \"a raw and realistic portrayal of how toxic anger and untreated mental illness can affect a family\".",
      "\"Even at its funniest, Hard Truths finds Marianne Jean-Baptiste channelling an anger that feels excruciatingly real,\" wrote Slant's Cole Kronman.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's Jon Frosch noted that Leigh \"pushes the bounds of our empathy and asks us to look, really look, at someone from whom we'd surely avert our gaze if we had the misfortune of crossing her path in real life\".",
      "Leigh famously spends several months rehearsing, and crafts his script based on improvisation sessions with the actors.",
      "\"Basically, the process is to create a character from scratch,\" Jean-Baptiste explains. \"Their first memory, their education, house they grew up in, family members, neighbours, where the local park was. Minute detail.\"",
      "The actors are then introduced to one another to build their characters' relationships. \"We do all sorts of exercises to establish the family routines and the traditions. We do improvisations based on, 'What's Sunday dinner like?'\"",
      "By the time shooting begins, the script is firmly in place. \"Nothing is ever improvised on camera,\" she explains. \"So we rehearse it and rehearse it.\"",
      "Oscars record",
      "Jean-Baptiste is speaking to BBC News the morning after the British Independent Film Awards, where she won best lead performance, one of several early accolades she has picked up.",
      "If she is ultimately shortlisted by Hollywood's Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on 17 January, Jean-Baptiste could become the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting.",
      "Coincidentally, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo is also a contender for best actress - meaning she could match that record, after also being nominated in 2020.",
      "\"I guess it's a sign of progress, and I think it's all great,\" Jean-Baptiste reflects. \"It's recognition for a job well done, I guess.\"",
      "Four black actresses from the US have previously scored two Academy nominations - Whoopi Goldberg, Angela Bassett, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer.",
      "Jean-Baptiste agrees strides have been made on diversity nearly a decade on from the OscarsSoWhite movement, but notes that the real issue is whether the work is available in the first place.",
      "\"I think [awards bodies] are trying. It's always going to come back down to opportunity, though,\" she says.",
      "\"If the films aren't being made that feature black women [or] Asian women in the lead role, then they don't even stand a chance of being nominated.",
      "\"So we always have to come back to the opportunities in the first place, the work being made, the stories being told.\"",
      "Notably, Jean-Baptiste now lives in Los Angeles - a place many British actors have moved to for the sake of their careers.",
      "\"Well, I was being offered work out there, so it made sense actually, because in the end I left to do a job that would require me to be there for an extended amount of time,\" she explains, referring to her 2000s TV police drama Without A Trace.",
      "\"Because that show went on for seven years. I'd been flying back and forth for the first year or two of the show, and then it was like, you know what, this is a lot. It's a long flight just for a weekend.\"",
      "When she's back in the UK, she relishes the chance to catch up on British theatre and read books on the London Underground (\"You have to drive in LA, so it's books on tape\").",
      "For now, though, her focus is on Hard Truths, which will be released in the UK on 31 January. Jean-Baptiste hopes viewers ultimately leave the film with \"a bit more compassion for people, difficult people\".",
      "\"Not to avoid them, necessarily, but just sort of ask your aunt what's going on, and if there's something you can do to help. Don't assume you're going to be berated for doing it.\"",

      "It's not something that will be offered to routinely yet, although the experts hope it could be rolled out more widely on the NHS. That could take five years or more, says Dr Ng.",
      "The British Heart Foundation, which is funding the work, says detecting people at risk of diabetes could ultimately save lives.",
      "Having uncontrolled type 2 diabetes can lead to heart attacks and strokes, for example.",
      "Maintaing a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet and exercising can help protect against complications.",
      "Professor Bryan Williams, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"This exciting research uses powerful artificial intelligence to analyse ECGs, revealing how AI can spot things that cannot usually be observed in routinely collected health data. This kind of insight could be a gamechanger in predicting future risk of developing type 2 diabetes, years before the condition begins.",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes is a rapidly growing health challenge that increases the risk of developing heart disease, however with the right support it is possible for people to reduce their risk of developing the condition. We look forward to seeing how this technology could be incorporated into clinical practice.\"",
      "Dr Faye Riley from Diabetes UK said: \u201cType 2 diabetes often goes undiagnosed, sometimes for many years. With 1.2 million people in England alone unaware they're living with the condition and millions more at high risk of developing it, identifying those at risk early on is crucial.",
      "\"AI-powered screening methods offer a promising new way to spot those likely to develop type 2 diabetes years in advance, allowing them to access the right support and prevent serious complications, such as heart failure and sight loss.\u201d",
      "What is type 2 diabetes?",
      "Type 2 diabetes is a common condition where the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood becomes too high.",
      "It happens if the body cannot make enough of, or cannot correctly use, a hormone called insulin, which controls blood sugar.",
      "Some cases are linked to being overweight.",
      "That is because fat can build up in and around the pancreas - the organ that makes insulin.",
      "Type 1 diabetes, meanwhile, is an autoimmune disease."

      "\"The United States is one of our most important allies and as we move into a new chapter in our friendship,\" he said.",
      "\"Peter will bring unrivalled experience to the role and take our partnership from strength to strength.\"",
      "Like other senior Labour figures, Lord Mandelson has a record of criticising Donald Trump, once describing him as \"little short of a white nationalist and racist\".",
      "In a recently unearthed interview with an Italian journalist in 2019, Lord Mandelson described Trump as a \"reckless and a danger to the world\".",
      "In a 2018 interview with the Evening Standard, he also called Trump \"a bully\".",
      "Since being touted as a potential candidate for the US-ambassador role, considered the most prestigious diplomatic post in the UK government, Lord Mandelson has softened his language on Trump.",
      "In November he made a pitch on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme to create \"a new relationship rather than a special one\" with the US.",
      "He also told News Agents podcast it is \"absolutely essential that we establish a relationship with President Trump that enables us not only to understand and interpret what he's doing but to influence it\".",
      "He added that the Labour government should try to \"reconnect\" with Trump's ally and tech multi-billionaire Elon Musk, who has been critical of Sir Keir's government and has been appointed head of new advisory team the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "As first reported in The Times, Lord Mandelson will replace Dame Karen Pierce, whose term in Washington DC is due to end as Trump enters the White House in early 2025.",
      "Sir Keir thanked Dame Karen for \"her invaluable service for the last four years, and in particular the wisdom and steadfast support she has given me personally since July\".",
      "UK ambassadors are normally career diplomats or civil servants, but Downing Street said choosing a leading Labour politician \"shows just how importantly we see our relationship with the Trump administration\".",
      "Labour Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said Lord Mandelson would make \"an excellent appointment\" as US ambassador.",
      "Kinnock, whose father Neil Kinnock gave Lord Mandelson his first senior role in Labour in the 1980s, pointed to the former EU Trade Commissioner's \"really strong experience in trade\".",
      "\"He's got very good political contacts in Washington DC and I think his appointment would be a reflection of the importance of the US-UK special relationship and I think Peter Mandelson would be a very good person to take that relationship forward,\" Kinnock added.",
      "But Lord Mandelson has been a divisive figures in British politics over many years.",
      "He resigned twice as a minister - once for failing to declare a home loan from a cabinet colleague, and a second time over accusations of using his position to influence a passport application.",
      "As a staunch critic of Brexit and advocate for global free-trade, he does not appear to be an obvious fit with the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The former cabinet minister and EU trade negotiator also has enormous political experience, and Downing Street may have judged that sending someone so close to the big political figures in the UK may go down well at the White House.",
      "Trump had once called Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage a \"great choice\" for ambassador - but Labour were unlikely to choose a political opponent such as Farage.",
      "Lord Mandelson has suggested making use of Farage's connections in the US as a \"bridgehead, both to President Trump and to Elon Musk and others\".",
      "\"You've got to be pragmatic, practical about this,\" he said.",
      "Farage has meanwhile said that he \"might disagree with Mandelson on his politics, but he's a very intelligent man\" and would be good choice for ambassador.",
      "Lord Mandelson was the Labour MP for Hartlepool from 1992 to 2004, during which time he served as Northern Ireland secretary and business secretary under Blair. He stood down as an MP in 2004 to become a European Commissioner before returning to the UK to become Gordon Brown's most senior minister.",
      "Sir Keir said on Thursday the UK would \"have to make sure that we avoid tariffs\" when asked about Trump's comments, and reiterated that he wanted to improve trade with Washington.",
      "Trump has pledged to impose wide-ranging tariffs on his first day in office, which experts say could cost the UK \u00a322bn.",

    "story": [
      "Unionist parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly will pull the Stormont Brake for the first time in an attempt to stop new EU rules on packaging and labelling of chemicals from applying in Northern Ireland.",
      "The brake is part of Northern Ireland's Brexit deal and gives the Stormont assembly the power to object to changes to EU rules that apply in Northern Ireland.",
      "It needs the support of 30 assembly members from at least two parties.",
      "All eligible unionist assembly members have supported a DUP motion for the pulling of the brake.",
      "'Host of new requirements'",
      "Once that has formally happened at the assembly it will be up to the British government to judge if the brake has been used appropriately.",
      "Meanwhile, the Stormont committee which scrutinises relevant EU legislation has published a report on the rules.",
      "It has been unable to reach a view on whether the rules have 'a significant impact on everyday life of communities in Northern Ireland.'",
      "Its finding may influence the government's view on whether the rule meets the threshold on the use of the brake.",
      "The main condition for it is that it must be shown that the rules would have \"a significant impact specific to every day life of communities in Northern Ireland\" in a way that is liable to persist.",
      "DUP leader Gavin Robinson said:  \"This EU regulation introduces a host of new requirements for labels attached to chemical products, including new minimum font sizes and rules around spacing.",
      "\"This would make current labels unusable for the majority of products.",
      "\"Critically, these changes would not be required for products on the market in Great Britain.",
      "\"The Chemical Industries Association (CIA), which represents chemical and pharmaceutical companies across the United Kingdom, has assessed that the regulation would have a significant, negative and prolonged impact on everyday life in Northern Ireland.\"",
      "'Pulling brake another DUP stunt'",
      "Stormont's Leader of the Opposition Matthew O'Toole has described the use of the brake as \"a stunt from the DUP\".",
      "O'Toole said he acknowledged issues around packaging and labelling of chemicals, but said there were far bigger challenges facing people in Northern Ireland.",
      "\"We warned that the so-called Stormont brake would be used for crude partisan purposes and so it has proven,\" the SDLP assembly member said.",
      "\"Where there are issues with this EU law, we certainly support efforts to smooth and mitigate their implementation and will engage with both the EU and UK on that basis.\"",
      "However, O'Toole added, the idea of this law causing \"persistent harm\" to the people of Northern Ireland \"is unsustainable and wrong-headed\".",
      "\"The consistent focusing on unionist obstruction to the detriment of a debate about how we maximise the opportunities from our position in relation to Europe is immensely frustrating.\"",
      "He said his party has brought proposals to Brussels and London that include \"ideas on increasing our voice and input including on laws such as this\"",
      "\"It would be helpful for our region if the debate could be about more than stunts and standoffs,\" O'Toole added.",
      "What are the government's options?",
      "If the government assesses the brake has been used appropriately it then begins a process with the EU.",
      "The Joint Committee - the UK-EU body responsible for overseeing the Brexit deal - is required to discuss the rule in question.",
      "Once those discussions are concluded the UK government can either send it back to the assembly for a cross-community vote known as an applicability motion or decide the rule should not apply in Northern Ireland.",
      "At that stage the government could still avoid a Stormont vote if it assesses there are \"exceptional circumstances\" including an assessment that the rule would not create a new regulatory border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.",
      "If the UK ultimately decides not to adopt the rule, the EU can take \"appropriate remedial measures\", which could include measures to address the fact that NI goods may no long fully comply with EU law.",
      "In March, Stormont used an applicability motion to block a new EU rule on the protection of geographical indications (GI) for craft and industrial products.",
      "At that time the government said it had noted the assembly vote and in October said it \"continues to evaluate the implications.\"",
      "What is the Stormont Brake?",

    "summary": "From fears of an election wipeout to bouncing back with the budget, John Swinney reflects on a chaotic 2024.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a markedly turbulent year on Scotland's frequently bonkers political scene, and for none more than John Swinney.",
      "As recently as April this year, the SNP veteran was a humble backbencher at Holyrood, beginning to contemplate whether he might stand down in 2026.",
      "But then came Humza Yousaf's self-inflicted downfall, which thrust Mr Swinney back into government.",
      "He was back on the campaign trail as his party suffered one of the worst electoral reverses in its history - a result he says could have easily been a wipeout.",
      "And now he insists the SNP is back on the front foot and striding towards a Holyrood vote - where he says he'll seek a full term, to be first minister until 2031.",
      "The first minister spoke to BBC Scotland's Podlitical podcast to go behind the scenes on the big moments of 2024.",
      "The SNP was not in a happy place at the turn of the year.",
      "Humza Yousaf came into office after a fractious leadership contest, and it felt like events were against him at every turn.",
      "Every time he planned a big announcement, Police Scotland seemed to scoop him with a fresh twist in Operation Branchform, the inquiry into the SNP's funding and finances.",
      "Mr Yousaf was also keen to allow more debate around the direction of the SNP, in a break from the very tight circle run by his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But it led to constant questions and rebellions over policy, with some contentious proposals being dropped, and particular debate about the party's partnership in government with the Greens.",
      "Mr Yousaf ultimately showed them the door in unceremonious fashion, and within days the Greens made clear they could help return the favour via a confidence vote in Holyrood.",
      "The first minister had to go. And with the SNP teetering on the brink, it turned to John Swinney.",
      "He was seen as taking the job - one he had decided not to run for a year earlier - out of loyalty to his party, rather than personal ambition.",
      "He accepts that his \"sense of duty prevailed\" - \"I felt I had to come back in and strengthen and rebuild my party and its reputation with the public\".",
      "The scale of the problem was immediately clear when a general election was called just weeks later.",
      "Mr Swinney described watching the exit poll come in - delivering the news that the SNP was to lose most of its seats - and thinking \"this could actually have been worse\".",
      "\"The conditions that I inherited, we could quite easily have been wiped out,\" he said. \"I don't think it would have taken much for that to have happened, when you look at the vote shares and all that went on.\"",
      "This isn't to escape the gravity of the result - being slashed from 48 seats to nine was \"an absolutely colossal setback\".",
      "But Mr Swinney always felt he could pick up the pieces.",
      "\"That's why my party turned to me,\" he said. \"They knew if there was one person on the planet who could turn things around for the SNP, it was John Swinney.\"",
      "That kind of bullishness might seem more in the vein of Alex Salmond than John Swinney.",
      "Mr Swinney served as his right-hand man before having a similar role under Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But he says his plans for his own leadership were inspired more by conversations with backbenchers - including Lib Dem Willie Rennie.",
      "The two spoke for \"quite a while\" on the fringes of a gender reform debate at Holyrood which went on deep into the night, and Mr Swinney says he had a vivid realisation that he had got out of the habit of even talking to opposition MSPs.",
      "He had more time for such chats during his period on the back benches, and on returning to government was \"determined I wasn't going to lose that important understanding of the need to connect\".",
      "Running a minority administration, Mr Swinney knows he needs to build bridges and find common ground with opponents in order to get anything done.",
      "But that doesn't mean there's no time for politics.",
      "The draft budget was the culmination of a period of furious manoeuvring between the SNP and Labour, two parties fighting for a very similar voter base and which view each other as their key electoral rival.",
      "It marked a major shift in tone from the government, and potentially of momentum in parliament.",
      "In September, Finance Secretary Shona Robison set out huge in-year cuts to balance the books, talking gloomily about austerity.",
      "Two months later she was announcing eye-catching new initiatives, and pitching a message of \"hope\".",
      "An injection of cash from the Treasury was doubtless pivotal, but Mr Swinney says the \"really tough stuff\" that had to be done in September got the government to a position of sustainability from which they could make more policy choices.",
      "The most striking choice was a promise to mitigate the two-child cap on benefit payments, something ministers had long bemoaned while insisting they had neither the power nor the funding to reverse it.",
      "The announcement was added to the budget so late in the day that the Scottish Fiscal Commission didn't have time to cost it; the watchdog termed it a \"fiscal risk\".",
      "Mr Swinney rejected the notion that the plan had been drafted in at the last moment because the original \"rabbit out of the hat\" - a reinstatement of a winter fuel payment for pensioner households - had to be released a week early.",
      "He said the team drawing up the budget, with himself and his deputy Kate Forbes \"very close to the construction\" along with the finance secretary Shona Robison, were looking for steps that would make the \"maximum impact\" on child poverty.",
      "\"We kept on feeling there wasn't enough there,\" he said, and \"we came to the conclusion that we had to add that into the programme\".",
      "The announcement left Labour in a spin.",
      "It ended a period of several years where the SNP seemed to be in the bunker; ditching controversial policies, desperately trying to scrape together the funds to keep expensive existing pledges afloat, and pitching very little that was new or notable.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon's former chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, said there had been a \"clear statement that the SNP has remembered that being in government enables it to drive the political agenda in Scotland\".",
      "Mr Swinney insists that the SNP is \"back on the front foot, and intend to stay there\".",
      "That will not be straightforward, because many of the pressures facing the party have not gone away.",
      "Operation Branchform will wrap up at some point, one way or another.",
      "The SNP is still short on cash, even more so following the general election catastrophe, and is gutting its HQ of staff.",
      "Mr Swinney still heads a minority administration, one short on goodwill in parliament.",
      "Former flagship policies have run aground - it is only a matter of time until the National Care Service is scrapped, once an excuse to blame the opposition presents itself.",
      "The first test of Mr Swinney's outreach programme will be the votes on the budget in February.",
      "He intends to hit the road in January to \"communicate the advantages of the budget to the public, to make sure the public exert pressure on parliament\" and vote for it.",
      "Appealing to the public is of course a handy thing to do in advance of an election campaign.",
      "Mr Swinney accepts that he might have stood down in 2026, had he remained on the back benches.",
      "Humza Yousaf has announced he is doing just that, making way for a \"new generation\" at the age of 39.",
      "His successor meanwhile will now be pitching himself to serve a full term as first minister, until 2031 - the year he will turn 67.",
      "Mr Swinney says he has been re-energised by what he terms a \"sabbatical year\" - saying that \"the best thing that happened to me was standing down and having a year out of the front line\".",
      "It provided time for parkruns in Perth, walks in the hills and standing on the side of pitches watching his son play hockey.",
      "He says this was a chance to \"totally recharge physically and mentally\", and insists that even after 27 years at Westminster and Holyrood he is absolutely up for another seven years in high office.",
      "That will require the support of voters - and it will need to be overwhelming support if Mr Swinney is to achieve his ultimate political goal, of Scottish independence.",
      "The constitutional question, so vital for the past decade, seems becalmed after the general election result.",
      "That defeat followed one in the Supreme Court, which meant the levers which could trigger independence seem largely outwith the first minister's hands.",
      "After years of head-scratching about ways to force the issue, Mr Swinney insists he doesn't want to get \"bogged down in process\".",
      "But some within the movement remain concerned that means there is no plan, no route map to follow through to independence.",
      "After years of talk of \"de facto referendums\" and complex solutions, Mr Swinney says there is a \"hard reality\" - \"independence will not come about unless enough folk in Scotland want it to happen\".",
      "He says he is focused on delivering good government, to make the case that Holyrood is capable of running its own affairs.",
      "And that is a task that Mr Swinney insists he is not just enjoying, but \"loving\" every moment of."

    "story": [
      "A biodiversity hotspot in a remote part of South Africa has become the hub of an illegal trade in protected plant species, with organised crime groups capitalising on overseas demand.",
      "\"They've not just stolen our land or our plants, they've stolen our heritage as well,\" a livestock farmer angrily tells the BBC, as she expresses dismay at the social and ecological crisis that the poaching has caused.",
      "Most of the plants in question are a variety known as succulents, named for their ability to hold water and survive in arid climates.",
      "Many of the world's succulent species are only found in the Succulent Karoo desert, which spans South Africa and Namibia.",
      "Succulent species range in size, shape and colour - some look like small multi-coloured buttons and some look like cacti, sprouting colourful flowers at certain times of the year.",
      "While these varieties can be cultivated in nurseries, global demand is also fuelling the poaching of these plants from the wild which are then smuggled and sold online to buyers in the US, Europe and East Asia.",
      "In Kamieskroon, a small town in the centre of South Africa's Namaqualand region, the rolling hills have become a haven for poachers.",
      "Some of the species are highly localised, and so can be wiped out by just a small amount of poaching.",
      "\"In South Africa, we know already of seven species that has been wiped out completely and there are certainly more species that will go extinct very soon,\" says Pieter van Wyk, a nursery curator at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.",
      "It is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that 1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seized by South Africa's law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.",
      "The South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a  strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.",
      "According to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.",
      "With international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.",
      "Mr Van Wyk says this coincided with an increase in global demand.",
      "\"People had more time to try to find something to keep busy with, and plants were one of the only things that in your house, could connect you to the outside world.\"",
      "This has been seized upon by organised crime syndicates who hire teams of plant poachers and then market the wild plants on social media and e-commerce platforms.",
      "\"The syndicates saw this as an opportunity of making something viral\u2026 telling a wide as possible public: 'We have this super-strange looking thing that comes from the African continent','\" Mr Van Wyk says.",
      "\"Then the public just loses their heads and they say: 'I want to buy one', and [the syndicates] arrange for the species to be poached,\" he adds.",
      "The uptick in organised crime activity in the region is having knock-on effects on local communities.",
      "\"This is a low-income area, people are not rich here, and people will exploit opportunities for income,\" explains Malinda Gardiner from Conservation South Africa.",
      "Expressing a similar view, the livestock farmer whom the BBC spoke to says there is always an influx of money in her community when poaching takes place.",
      "\"When we see young men going up in the mountain areas, we know they're poachers,\" adds the farmer, who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisals.",
      "\"They use screwdrivers to uproot the succulents and they carry backpacks and sacks to keep the stolen plants.\"",
      "A few days after that, there is an outbreak of binge drinking and illegal activity.",
      "\"When they get the money, there's more drugs, more alcohol, children are neglected because mummy is drunk, daddy is drunk, there's no food,\" adds Ms Gardiner.",
      "She worries that the tensions will have longer-term effects.",
      "\"Small communities here really need each other\u2026 but this brings distrust. It brings a split in the communities as well,\" she says.",
      "Mr Van Wyk's assessment is starker: \"People are being abused and enslaved by syndicates and buyers.\"",
      "Attempts are being made to raise awareness among buyers about the importance of understanding where a plant might have come from.",
      "China has become a major source of demand for wild succulents in the last few years, but an internet campaign there to educate people about the illegal succulent trade has seen some results.",
      "The Clean Internet for Conophytum campaign was launched in March 2023 by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.",
      "According to the foundation's deputy secretary-general Linda Wong, they have seen an 80% reduction in online adverts for conophytum - a type of succulent - with an unknown source, and buyers are starting to ask questions about where plants being sold online have come from.",
      "\"The key is awareness. Once people know, they want to take action. They want to take responsibility to consume those plants and enjoy their beauty in a very responsible way,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Conservationists advise customers all over the world to ask about the origin of a plant, and under no circumstances should they buy those advertised as wild.",
      "Traffic and the UK's Kew Gardens recently announced that they were teaming up with eBay to develop new ways of preventing the sale of wild succulents on its platform.",
      "In South Africa, Mr Van Wyk says more should be done to promote the cultivation of succulents that can be grown and harvested legally, to reduce the demand for poaching.",
      "\"We as a country need to say that: 'We have this resource, and there are other countries that are majorly benefiting from this, why aren't we?'\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Van Wyk now runs a nursery at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park which looks after plants that have been confiscated by law enforcement, and he says they have received more than 200,000 so far.",
      "\"It's obviously stressful seeing things disappearing. But if you study these plants, it brings so much joy and pleasure and you just forget about all the nonsense that's happening in the world,\" Mr Van Wyk says.",

      "Parker Solar Probe launched in 2018, heading to the centre of our solar system.",
      "It has already swept past the Sun 21 times, getting ever nearer, but the Christmas Eve visit is record-breaking.",
      "At its closest approach, the probe is 3.8 million miles (6.2 million km) from our star's surface.",
      "This might not sound that close, but Nasa's Nicola Fox puts it into perspective: \"We are 93 million miles away from the Sun, so if I put the Sun and the Earth one metre apart, Parker Solar Probe is four centimetres from the Sun - so that's close.\"",
      "The probe will have to endure temperatures of 1,400C and radiation that could frazzle the onboard electronics.",
      "It is protected by a 11.5cm (4.5 inches) thick carbon-composite shield but the spacecraft's tactic is to get in and out fast.",

      "Parker's speed comes from the immense gravitational pull it feels as it falls towards the Sun.",
      "So why go to all this effort to \"touch\" the Sun?",
      "Scientists hope that as the spacecraft passes through our star's outer atmosphere - its corona - it will solve a long standing mystery.",

      "She admits she is nervous about the audacious attempt, but she has faith in the probe.",
      "\"I will worry about the spacecraft. But we really have designed it to withstand all of these brutal, brutal conditions. It's a tough, tough little spacecraft.\"",

      "But solving the cube may also elicit happiness because it taps into other emotions, according to Dr Julia Christensen, a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Germany. \"Awe, beauty, being moved, all these are aesthetic emotions, and experiencing them gives us an extreme sense of happiness,\" she says.",
      "\"For example, when a pattern is the right pattern, when a move is particularly amazing on the cube, these aesthetic emotions can give transformative experiences.\"",
      "Some speedcubers have described the state of mind that the activity can bring as a sense of \"flow\".",
      "\"This state is achieved when the activity's difficulty matches your skill level, distractions are minimal, the goals are clear, and feedback is immediate \u2014 all of which are characteristics of speedcubing,\" says Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Flow can feel \"almost meditative\", according to Ian Scheffler, author of Cracking the Cube, who has experienced this first-hand. \"You enter this state where you are kind of thinking and not thinking at the same time - you are reacting to what the cube is giving you, but in almost an instinctual way.",
      "\"It's a kind of mindfulness that's deeply rewarding\u2026 a peaceful, calm state where you're completely in tune with every twist of the puzzle.\"",
      "There is good reason to seek a flow state regularly, according to Dr Christensen. \"Science shows that people who regularly experience flow have a better mental health, possibly better physical health, and are more in tune.",
      "\"When we repeat movements they become logged or encoded from explicit, effort-full memory systems, and pass into implicit, less effort-full, and procedural memory systems,\" she continues.",
      "Nicholas Archer, a 17-year-old speedcuber from West Yorkshire, who won the one-handed competition in this year's UK Championship with an average time of 8.69 seconds, says that he has experienced this. \"When I'm solving the cube, I'm certainly not having to think too much about what I'm doing. It's all automatic.\"",
      "Speedcubing social benefits",
      "\"Speedcubing or solving a cube on your own may increase your happiness,\" says Dr Adil Khan, a reader in neuroscience at King's College London (KCL) - but when combined with the social aspect, any benefits may be greater.",
      "\"Since speedcubing is a social phenomenon, perhaps the social aspect combines with the puzzle solving to deliver a deeply satisfying experience.\"",
      "Jan Hammer started speedcubing at the age of 44, after being introduced to it by his 13-year-old daughter. He has since solved the cube around 10,000 times but does not think he would have maintained this level of enthusiasm had he been speedcubing alone.",
      "\"The fact that I can do this with my daughter and that we cheer for each other is wonderful. Additionally, being part of the cube community has become a huge motivation.\"",
      "Competitions tend to have more children and teenagers - it is not uncommon for competitors to be as young as six. The activity is also significantly more popular with males. The World Cube Association reports that 221,117 men have competed at their events, compared with 24,311 women.",
      "Regardless of demographic, \"for those who view speedcubing as a significant part of their life - such as participants in tournaments - it can offer eudemonic happiness, fostering a sense of purpose and meaning through dedication, accomplishment, and community of like-minded people,\" argues Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Psychologists differentiate between two aspects of happiness: \"hedonic wellbeing,\" related to emotional experiences, and \"eudemonic wellbeing,\" which concerns meaning and purpose in life.",
      "\"Both are essential for overall happiness and speedcubing can contribute to both types of wellbeing,\" she says. All of this \"contributes to better mental health\".",
      "Puzzles and the brain: the science",
      "The effects of speedcubing on the brain and cognitive function are, however, less clear.",
      "While solving a cube, the brain is trying out different moves, asking \"what might happen if I move the cube in this way?\" explains Dr Toby Wise, senior research fellow in neuroimaging at King's College London.",
      "\"Your brain stores a memory trace for different configurations of the cube, and it can run through different configurations to predict which will have the best outcome.\"",
      "However it doesn't necessarily create long-term benefits, like improvements to memory function. This is because, as Dr Khan explains, the brain is not like a muscle that needs to be flexed to make it grow.",
      "For many years it has been suggested by some that solving puzzles, whether Sudoku or crosswords, can have a hand in slowing cognitive decline or dementia. However this is not necessarily the case.",
      "A study undertaken by Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the University of Aberdeen, and published in the BMJ in 2018, found that people who regularly do intellectual activities throughout life have higher mental abilities, providing a \"higher cognitive point\" from which to decline, but that they do not decline any slower.",
      "\"Solving puzzles does not improve your brain power in much other than the puzzle itself,\" argues Dr Khan. \"And almost certainly does not prevent age-related decline in brain power.\"",
      "'The school system is broken': Why more parents are home-educating their children",
      "How the internet normalised extreme porn - and shaped male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "One further benefit of speedcubing, according to regular players, is its sense of escapism from frenzied modern life.",
      "\"Having a clear goal, something that you can actually realise, is something that we don't necessarily have in everyday life, and that appeases our brain,\" says Dr Christensen.",
      "This perhaps explains why the cube is so popular in an age with myriad computer games and technological activities to choose from. As Mr Hammer puts it: \"When I pick up the cube, I become more alert and focused.\"",
      "He uses it in the workplace too. \"It can help me enter the next meeting with a more structured perspective,\" he says.",
      "Mr Scheffler agrees: \"The process of taking the cube from this chaotic, disordered state, which is always different because there's so many permutations of the puzzle, to the same ordered state is fundamentally something that humans want to be doing.",
      "\"There's a fundamental human need to make order out of disorder, because the universe is a very chaotic place, and most things are not ordered.\"",

    "story": [
      "This is the third feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Ovarian cancer is \u201crare, underfunded, and deadly\", says Audra Moran, head of the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (Ocra), a global charity based in New York.",
      "Like all cancers, the earlier it is detected the better.",
      "Most ovarian cancer starts in the fallopian tubes, so by the time it gets to the ovaries, it may have already spread elsewhere too.",
      "\"Five years prior to ever having a symptom is when you might have to detect ovarian cancer, to affect mortality,\" says Ms Moran.",
      "But new blood tests are emerging that use the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to spot signs of the cancer in its very early stages.",
      "And it's not just cancer, AI can also speed up other blood tests for potentially deadly infections like pneumonia.",
      "Dr Daniel Heller is a biomedical engineer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.",
      "His team have been developed a testing technology which uses nanotubes -  tiny tubes of carbon which are around 50,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.",
      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",
      "In this case the fingerprint is a pattern of molecules binding to sensors, with different sensitivities and binding strengths.",
      "But the patterns are too subtle for a human to pick out.",
      "\"We can look at the data and we will not make sense of it at all,\" he says. \"We can only see the patterns that are different with AI.\"",
      "Decoding the nanotube data meant loading the data into a machine-learning algorithm, and telling the algorithm which samples came from patients with ovarian cancer, and which from people without it.",
      "These included blood from people with other forms of cancer, or other gynaecological disease that might be confused with ovarian cancer.",
      "More AI and Medicine",
      "More AI and Medicine",
      "A big challenge in using AI to develop blood tests for ovarian cancer research is that it is relatively rare, which limits the data for training algorithms.",
      "And much of even that data is siloed in hospitals that treated them, with minimal data sharing for researchers.",
      "Dr Heller describes training the algorithm on available data from just a few 100 patients as a \"Hail Mary pass\".",
      "But he says the AI was able to get better accuracy than the best cancer biomarkers that are available today - and that was just the first try.",
      "The system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors, and samples from many more patients. More data can improve the algorithm, just as algorithms for self-driving cars can improve with more testing on the street.",
      "Dr Heller has high hopes for the tech.",
      "\"What we'd like to do is triage all gynaecological disease - so when someone comes in with a complaint, can we give doctors a tool that quickly tells them it's more likely to be a cancer or not, or this cancer than that.\"",
      "Dr Heller says this may be \"three to five years\" away.",
      "It's not just early detection that AI is potentially useful for, it is also speeding up other blood tests.",
      "For a cancer patient, catching pneumonia can be deadly and, as there are around 600 different organisms that can cause pneumonia, doctors have to conduct multiple tests to identify the infection.",
      "But new types of blood tests are simplifying and speeding up the process.",
      "Karuis, based in California uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help identify the precise pneumonia pathogen in 24 hours, and select the right antibiotic for it.",
      "\u201cBefore our test, a patient with pneumonia would have 15 to 20 different tests to identify their infection in just in their first week in hospital - that's about $20,000 in testing,\u201d says Karius chief executive Alec Ford.",
      "Karius has a database of microbial DNA which has tens of billions of data points. Test samples from patients can be compared to that database to identify the exact pathogen.",
      "Mr Ford says that would have been impossible without AI.",
      "One challenge is that researchers don\u2019t necessarily currently understand all the connections that an AI might make between the test biomarkers and the diseases.",
      "Over the last two years Dr Slav\u00e9 Petrovski has developed an AI platform called Milton that, using biomarkers in the UK biobank data to identify 120 diseases with a success rate of over 90%.",
      "Finding patterns in such a mass of data is only something that AI can do.",
      "\u201cThese are often complex patterns, where there may not be one biomarker, but you have to take into consideration the whole pattern,\u201d says Dr Petrovski, whose is a researcher at pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca.",
      "Dr Heller uses a similar pattern matching technique in his work on ovarian cancer.",
      "\"We know that the sensor binds and responds to proteins and small molecules in the blood, but we don't know which of the proteins or molecules are specific to cancer,\" he says.",
      "More broadly data, or the lack of it, is still a drawback.",
      "\"People aren't sharing their data, or there's not a mechanism to do it,\" says Ms Moran.",
      "Ocra is funding a large-scale patient registry, with electronic medical records of patients who've allowed researchers to train algorithms on their data.",

    "summary": "A BBC reporter looks back to the day in 2004 when the tsunami hit while she was on the Andaman and Nicobar islands.",
    "story": [
      "Boxing Day, 2004.",
      "When the earthquake struck at 06:30 (01:00 GMT), I was on a ferry, headed towards Havelock \u2013 an island in the Indian archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar.",
      "Known for its silver sand and clear blue waters, the Radhanagar beach there had recently been crowned \"Asia's Best Beach\" by Time magazine.",
      "My best friend from college and her family had lived in Port Blair, the capital of the archipelago, for a decade and a half, but this was my first visit to the islands, where I had arrived on Christmas Eve.",
      "We had planned to spend three days in Havelock and in the morning we packed snacks and sandwiches, gathered excited children and headed out to catch the ferry from Phoenix Bay jetty in Port Blair.",
      "Not wanting to miss out on anything, I was standing on the front deck, looking around, when disaster struck.",
      "Just as we pulled out from the harbour, the boat lurched and suddenly the jetty next to where we had boarded crumpled and fell into the sea. It was followed by the watchtower and an electricity pole.",
      "It was an extraordinary sight. Dozens of people standing alongside me watched open-mouthed.",
      "Thankfully, the jetty was deserted at the time so there were no casualties. A boat was due to leave from there in half an hour but the travellers were yet to arrive.",
      "A member of the boat's crew told me it was an earthquake. At the time I didn't know, but the 9.1 magnitude quake was the third most powerful ever recorded in the world - and remains the biggest and most destructive in Asia.",
      "Occurring off the coast of northwest Sumatra under the Indian Ocean, it unleashed a devastating tsunami that killed an estimated 228,000 people across more than a dozen countries and caused massive damage in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Maldives and Thailand.",
      "The Andaman and Nicobar islands, located just about 100km north of the epicentre, suffered extensive damage when a wall of water, as high as 15 metres (49 ft) in places, hit land just about 15 minutes later.",
      "The official death toll was put at 1,310 \u2013 but with more than 5,600 people missing and presumed dead, it's believed that more than 7,000 islanders perished.",
      "While on the boat, however, we were oblivious to the scale of destruction around us. Our mobile phones didn't work on the water and we only got snippets of information from the crew. We heard about damage in Sri Lanka, Bali, Thailand and Maldives \u2013 and the southern Indian coastal town of Nagapattinam.",
      "But there was no information about Andaman and Nicobar - a collection of hundreds of islands scattered around in the Bay of Bengal, located about 1,500km (915 miles) east of India's mainland.",
      "Only 38 of them were inhabited. They were home to 400,000 people, including six hunter-gatherer groups who had lived isolated from the outside world for thousands of years.",
      "The only way to get to the islands was by ferries but, as we later learnt, an estimated 94% of the jetties in the region were damaged.",
      "That was also the reason why, on 26 December 2004, we never made it to Havelock. The jetty there was damaged and under water, we were told.",
      "So the boat turned around and started on its return journey. For a while, there was speculation that we might not get clearance to dock at Port Blair for safety reasons and might have to spend the night at anchor.",
      "This made the passengers  \u2013 most of them tourists looking forward to sun and sand \u2013 anxious.",
      "After several hours of bobbing along in rough seas, we returned to Port Blair. Because Phoenix Bay had been closed following the morning's damage, we were taken to Chatham, another harbour in Port Blair. The jetty where we were dropped had huge, gaping holes in places.",
      "The signs of devastation were all around us as we headed home \u2013 buildings had turned into rubble, small upturned boats sat in the middle of the streets and roads had great gashes in them. Thousands of people had been turned homeless when the tidal wave flooded their homes in low-lying areas.",
      "I met a traumatised nine-year-old girl whose house was filled with water and she told me she had nearly drowned. A woman told me she had lost her entire life's possessions in the blink of an eye.",
      "Over the next three weeks, I reported extensively on the disaster and its effects on the population.",
      "It was the first time a tsunami had wreaked such havoc in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the scale of the tragedy was overwhelming.",
      "Salt water contaminated many sources of fresh water and destroyed large tracts of arable land. Getting vital supplies into the islands was tough with jetties unserviceable.",
      "The authorities mounted a huge relief and rescue effort. The army, navy and air force were deployed, but it took days before they could get to all the islands.",
      "Every day, navy and coast guard ships brought boatloads of people made homeless by the tsunami from other islands to Port Blair where schools and government buildings were turned into temporary shelters.",
      "They brought stories of devastation in their homelands. Many told me they had escaped with nothing but the clothes on their backs.",
      "One woman from Car Nicobar told me that when the earthquake struck, the ground started to spew foamy water at the same time as the waves came in from the sea.",
      "She and hundreds of others from her village had waited for rescuers without food or water for 48 hours. She said it was a \"miracle\" that she and her 20-day-old baby had survived.",
      "Port Blair was almost daily jolted by aftershocks, some of them strong enough to start rumours of fresh tsunamis, making scared people run to get to higher ground.",
      "A few days later, the Indian military flew journalists to Car Nicobar, a flat fertile island known for its enchanting beaches and also home to a large Indian air force colony.",
      "The killer tsunami had completely flattened the base. The water rose by 12 metres here and as most people slept, the ground was pulled away from under their feet. A hundred people died here. More than half were air force officers and their families.",
      "We visited Malacca and Kaakan villages on the island which also bore the brunt of nature's fury, forcing residents to take shelter in tents along the road. Among them were families torn apart by the tidal wave.",
      "A grief-stricken young couple told me they had managed to save their five-month-old baby, but their other children, aged seven and 12, were washed away.",
      "Surrounded by coconut palms on all sides, every house had turned into rubble. Among the personal belongings strewn about were clothes, textbooks, a child's shoe and a music keyboard.",
      "The only thing that stood - surprisingly intact - was a bust of the father of the Indian nation, Mahatma Gandhi, at a traffic roundabout.",
      "A senior army officer told us his team had recovered seven bodies that day and we watched their mass cremation from a distance.",
      "At the air force base, we watched as rescuers pulled a woman's body from the debris.",
      "An official said that for every body found in Car Nicobar, several had been swept away by the waves without leaving a trace.",
      "After all these years, I still sometimes think about the day I hopped on the ferry to go to Havelock.",
      "I wonder what would have happened if the tremors had come a few minutes earlier.",
      "And what would have happened if the wall of water had hit the shore while I waited on the jetty to board our ferry?",
      "On Boxing Day, 2004, I had a close call. Thousands who perished were not so lucky.",

    "summary": "It used to be considered treason in France - but now, alcohol-free wine is here to stay.",
    "story": [
      "In the vineyards of Bordeaux, the unspeakable has become the drinkable. Wine without alcohol has arrived.",
      "The heresy of yesterday is now \u2013 thanks to science and economic crisis \u2013 the opportunity of today.",
      "Wine estates which would have torched their grapes rather than submit to such ignominy, are now openly contemplating the booze-free bottle.",
      "And developers are moving ahead fast, creating wines that are deliberately designed to get the best from the de-alcoholisation process.",
      "\"When we started a few years ago, what we were making was frankly rubbish,\" says Bordeaux oenologist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brochet, who has helped create the Moderato range of no-alcohol wines.",
      "\"But we have made great progress. And today we are getting nearer and nearer to our goal. I think it is going to be a revolution in the wine world.\"",
      "Bordeaux has just seen the launch of its first ever cave \u2013 wine shop \u2013 dedicated solely to no-alcohol wines, reflecting a shift in perceptions which has taken many in the industry by surprise.",
      "\"We only opened four weeks ago, and already we are getting wine-growers from the area coming in and asking about the non-alcohol market,\" says Alexandre Kettaneh,  who owns Les Belles Grappes with his wife Anne.",
      "\"They don't know anything about how to do it, but they can see it is coming and want to be part of it.\"",
      "Several things have happened to make the moment opportune.",
      "First of all, the French wine world is in deep difficulty. Domestic consumption continues to fall and the Chinese market is not what it was. US President-elect Donald Trump is threatening new levies. Prized ancient vineyards across France are being grubbed up.",
      "Second, consumption habits are shifting, especially among the young. Supermarkets now give more space to beer than they do to wine. Most 20-somethings have never had the habit of wine \u2013 and they are also far more health-conscious than their elders.",
      "The non-alcohol lifestyle is spreading. Currently 10% of the French beer market is alcohol-free. In Spain it is 25%.",
      "And third \u2013 the technology has improved by leaps and bounds.",
      "In the past \u2013 and still today for cheaper brands \u2013 the method has simply been to boil away the alcohol and then add compensatory flavours. The result \u2013 especially for reds \u2013 is at best mediocre. Such drinks cannot even call themselves wine, but \"beverages based on de-alcoholised wine\".",
      "Now though, there are new methods of low-temperature vacuum distillation, and of \"capturing\" aromas for putting back into the de-alcoholised wine. The result is wines that can legally call themselves wines, and are beginning to hold their own among discerning consumers.",
      "\"With reds, you need to be prepared for an experience which will not be the same as a traditional wine with alcohol. We cannot pretend we can replicate, yet, the full mouth-feel,\" says Fabien Marchand-Cassagne of Moderato.",
      "\"But what you will get is a genuine wine moment. Bouquet, tannins, fruits, balance \u2013 it is all there to be enjoyed.\"",
      "At the Clos De Bouard estate near Saint-Emilion, fully a third of sales are now of the chateau's two \u2013 soon to be three \u2013 non-alcoholic brands. Owner Coralie de Bouard first glimpsed the possibilities when she was asked in 2019 to develop a non-alcoholic wine for the Qatari owners of PSG football club.",
      "\"My family wouldn't talk to me for a year, such was my 'treason'. And even today I get hate mail from wine-growers saying I am ruining the market,\" she says.",
      "\"But now my father congratulates me and says I am the locomotive in the wine train. And if we are surviving today in these difficult times, it is because we have shifted towards the no-alcohol market.\"",
      "\"For the purists it's been very difficult to accept,\" says Bernard Rabouy, a wine-grower for the Bordeaux Families cooperative.",
      "\"But we have to evolve. The fact is that the customers aren't where they used to be. So we have to go and get them or they will go somewhere else.\"",
      "Promoters of alcohol-free wine make much of the notion that it allows non-drinkers \u2013 who used to feel excluded \u2013 to join in the wine-banter. And it is true that the rituals of opening, sniffing, describing and comparing are now open to all.",
      "\"What we want to do is try to bring back the France of our youth \u2013 when everyone sat around the dinner table and drank wine, and it was a real moment of sharing,\" says Anne Kattaneh.",
      "\"And these days the only way we are going to be able to do that is if non-alcoholic wines are part of the culture.\"",
      "\"The idea that the wine world was always as it is now, is rubbish,\" says oenologist Brochet.",
      "\"Things evolve. Once upon a time the barrel was an innovation. The cork was an innovation; grape varietals were an innovation. And now this is a new one \u2013 which could help save the industry and the wonderful landscape and culture that goes with it.",
      "\"As [poet] Paul Valery said \u2013 what is tradition, but an innovation that succeeded?\""

    "summary": "Over the centuries, painters in India have depicted Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.",
    "story": [
      "The birth of Jesus Christ - a seminal biblical event - has been the subject of many paintings by Western artists, who have often applied the ideas of beauty and creativity prevalent there while depicting the event on canvas.",
      "These works are among the most widely available representations of Christian art, shaping how the world views this biblical event and subliminally divesting those outside the West from influencing it.",
      "But over the centuries, artists in India have sought to express their vision of this event by painting Jesus's birth and other Christian themes in their own style.",
      "Some have done so consciously, others unconsciously, but the end result is a body of work that breathes new life and meaning into the event of Christ's birth, and Christianity itself.",
      "Here are some paintings from Indian art history that present Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.",
      "Mughal emperor Muhammad Jalaluddin Akbar is credited with introducing northern India to Christianity by inviting Jesuit missionaries to visit his court.",
      "The missionaries brought with them holy scriptures and European artworks on Christian themes which influenced court painters. Akbar and his successors also commissioned many murals with Christian themes and some court painters began infusing these paintings with elements of Islamic art.",
      "Neha Vermani, a historian of South Asia, talks about a painting made by Mughal court artists which featured emperor Jahangir in the nativity scene, which traditionally feature Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus.",
      "\"Mughal rulers saw themselves as being 'just' rulers, capable of maintaining harmony and balance in their kingdoms; they were 'universal rulers'. Allowing different religions to co-exist was integral to how they saw themselves and wanted themselves to be remembered,\" Ms Vermani says.",
      "The 18th Century painting below features typical stylistic elements of Mughal art, including highly stylised figures, vibrant colours, naturalism and ornamentation.",
      "Born in 1887 in what is now India's West Bengal state, Jamini Roy is celebrated for creating a unique visual language by bringing together elements of Bengali folk art and Kalighat paintings - a distinctive art form that originated in the vicinity of a renowned temple in Kolkata city.",
      "Ashish Anand, CEO and managing director of art firm DAG says that art critic WG Archer once observed that Christ represented a Santhal figure (the Santhals are an Indian tribal group) for Jamini Roy.",
      "\"The simplicity of Christ's life and his sacrifice appealed to Roy, making his paintings on Christian themes at least as important as those on Hindu mythology, all of them rendered in the folk style of modernism that he made distinctively his own,\" he says.",
      "Born in 1902 in the western state of Goa, Angelo de Fonseca is credited with creating unique Christian iconography that married Eastern and Western influences with his Goan sensibilities.",
      "In his paintings, Mary isn't depicted as a fair maiden in a blue gown, but looks very much like an Indian woman with brown skin, dressed in a sari and wearing a mangalsutra (a piece of traditional Indian jewellery worn by married Hindu women).",
      "Biblical scenes unfold in local settings and feature motifs and elements that speak to an Indian audience.",
      "Through his art, he tried to counter the narrative of the West being the cradle of beauty and artistic creativity.",
      "\"Fonseca wanted to situate Christianity - which has largely been viewed as a western religious tradition - within the Indian subcontinent. It was from this angst that his watercolours painted Christianity anew,\" Rinald D'Souza, director of the Xavier Centre of Historical Research, Goa, told the BBC."

    "story": [
      "A biodiversity hotspot in a remote part of South Africa has become the hub of an illegal trade in protected plant species, with organised crime groups capitalising on overseas demand.",
      "\"They've not just stolen our land or our plants, they've stolen our heritage as well,\" a livestock farmer angrily tells the BBC, as she expresses dismay at the social and ecological crisis that the poaching has caused.",
      "Most of the plants in question are a variety known as succulents, named for their ability to hold water and survive in arid climates.",
      "Many of the world's succulent species are only found in the Succulent Karoo desert, which spans South Africa and Namibia.",
      "Succulent species range in size, shape and colour - some look like small multi-coloured buttons and some look like cacti, sprouting colourful flowers at certain times of the year.",
      "While these varieties can be cultivated in nurseries, global demand is also fuelling the poaching of these plants from the wild which are then smuggled and sold online to buyers in the US, Europe and East Asia.",
      "In Kamieskroon, a small town in the centre of South Africa's Namaqualand region, the rolling hills have become a haven for poachers.",
      "Some of the species are highly localised, and so can be wiped out by just a small amount of poaching.",
      "\"In South Africa, we know already of seven species that has been wiped out completely and there are certainly more species that will go extinct very soon,\" says Pieter van Wyk, a nursery curator at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.",
      "It is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that 1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seized by South Africa's law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.",
      "The South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a  strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.",
      "According to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.",
      "With international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.",
      "Mr Van Wyk says this coincided with an increase in global demand.",
      "\"People had more time to try to find something to keep busy with, and plants were one of the only things that in your house, could connect you to the outside world.\"",
      "This has been seized upon by organised crime syndicates who hire teams of plant poachers and then market the wild plants on social media and e-commerce platforms.",
      "\"The syndicates saw this as an opportunity of making something viral\u2026 telling a wide as possible public: 'We have this super-strange looking thing that comes from the African continent','\" Mr Van Wyk says.",
      "\"Then the public just loses their heads and they say: 'I want to buy one', and [the syndicates] arrange for the species to be poached,\" he adds.",
      "The uptick in organised crime activity in the region is having knock-on effects on local communities.",
      "\"This is a low-income area, people are not rich here, and people will exploit opportunities for income,\" explains Malinda Gardiner from Conservation South Africa.",
      "Expressing a similar view, the livestock farmer whom the BBC spoke to says there is always an influx of money in her community when poaching takes place.",
      "\"When we see young men going up in the mountain areas, we know they're poachers,\" adds the farmer, who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisals.",
      "\"They use screwdrivers to uproot the succulents and they carry backpacks and sacks to keep the stolen plants.\"",
      "A few days after that, there is an outbreak of binge drinking and illegal activity.",
      "\"When they get the money, there's more drugs, more alcohol, children are neglected because mummy is drunk, daddy is drunk, there's no food,\" adds Ms Gardiner.",
      "She worries that the tensions will have longer-term effects.",
      "\"Small communities here really need each other\u2026 but this brings distrust. It brings a split in the communities as well,\" she says.",
      "Mr Van Wyk's assessment is starker: \"People are being abused and enslaved by syndicates and buyers.\"",
      "Attempts are being made to raise awareness among buyers about the importance of understanding where a plant might have come from.",
      "China has become a major source of demand for wild succulents in the last few years, but an internet campaign there to educate people about the illegal succulent trade has seen some results.",
      "The Clean Internet for Conophytum campaign was launched in March 2023 by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.",
      "According to the foundation's deputy secretary-general Linda Wong, they have seen an 80% reduction in online adverts for conophytum - a type of succulent - with an unknown source, and buyers are starting to ask questions about where plants being sold online have come from.",
      "\"The key is awareness. Once people know, they want to take action. They want to take responsibility to consume those plants and enjoy their beauty in a very responsible way,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Conservationists advise customers all over the world to ask about the origin of a plant, and under no circumstances should they buy those advertised as wild.",
      "Traffic and the UK's Kew Gardens recently announced that they were teaming up with eBay to develop new ways of preventing the sale of wild succulents on its platform.",
      "In South Africa, Mr Van Wyk says more should be done to promote the cultivation of succulents that can be grown and harvested legally, to reduce the demand for poaching.",
      "\"We as a country need to say that: 'We have this resource, and there are other countries that are majorly benefiting from this, why aren't we?'\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Van Wyk now runs a nursery at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park which looks after plants that have been confiscated by law enforcement, and he says they have received more than 200,000 so far.",

      "Most of Pokrovsk's population has already fled. The gas supply's been turned off and many homes are without electricity and water. Those who remain, like 59-year-old Ihor,  only break cover to find the bare essentials. He says it's like living on a powder keg \u2013 you never know when or where the next shell will land.",

      "The city has already prepared for the worst. The statue of its famous composer, Mykola Leontovych, has already been removed. The music school that bore his name now lies boarded up and empty.",
      "Leontovych may not be well known in the West. But the tune he composed is familiar around the world - with its chime-like vocals. It's thought that Leontovych wrote the early scores of the composition, based on a Ukrainian folk chant, while he was living and working in Pokrovsk between 1904 and 1908.",
      "In Ukraine it's known as Shchedryk. To most of the world it became known as the Carol of the Bells, after American composer Peter Wilhousky wrote English lyrics for the song. The tune's use in the Hollywood film Home Alone helped boost its popularity.",

      "For Anna, the tune brings back memories. \"When I played it at home it seemed happy. It reminded me of winter and Christmas,\" she says. \"Now it's more of a sad song to me because it reminds me of home, and I really want to go back.\"",
      "But for one Ukrainian military band, Shchedryk has become a song to inspire resistance. They're even playing it in the trenches \u2013 using weapons as improvised instruments.",
      "They may be musicians, but their commander reminds me that they're soldiers first. All have spent time on the front line. Colonel Bohdan Zadorozhnyy, the head of the band and its conductor, says the song helps lifts soldiers spirits. \"Those beats and rhythms cheer up the guys on the front line and inspire them to fight,\" he says.",
      "22-year-old Roman uses a rocket launcher casing, filled with rice, to shake vigorously in time with the music. Shchedryk, he says, is the \"pride of our country, it's freedom, it's in our souls, I get goosebumps from this song\".",

      "Texas Republican Chip Roy posted on X that the decision was \"unconscionable\" and an abuse of power \"to carry out a miscarriage of justice\".",
      "Another Republican, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, said that \"when given the choice between law-abiding Americans or criminals, Joe Biden and the Democrats choose criminals every time.\"",
      "Some family members also expressed anger.",
      "On Facebook, Heather Turner - whose mother was killed in a 2017 bank robbery - called the commutations a \"gross abuse of power\".",
      "\"At no point did the president consider the victims,\" she wrote. \"He, and his supporters, have blood on their hands.\"",
      "The commutations do not apply to the approximately 2,200 death row inmates convicted by state courts, over which the president holds no authority.",
      "What has Trump said about the death penalty?",
      "Over the course of his election campaign, Trump vowed to resume federal executions and make more people eligible to receive the death penalty, including those convicted of raping children or drug and human-trafficking cases, as well as migrants who kill US citizens or police officers.",
      "\"These are terrible, terrible, horrible people who are responsible for death, carnage and crime all over the country,\" Trump said when he announced his presidential candidacy in 2022.",
      "\"We're going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught, to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts,\" he added.",
      "There are more than 40 federal laws that can, in theory, result in the death penalty, ranging from murders committed during a drug-related shooting to genocide.",
      "Almost all - with the exception of espionage and treason - explicitly involve the death of a victim.",
      "Trump, however, has provided few details on how he plans to accomplish his campaign pledge.",
      "Despite the lack of clarity, Trump's vows to expand the federal death penalty have elicited strong warnings from human rights advocates.",
      "In an 11 December statement, for example, the American Civil Liberties Union said Trump's \"chilling\" plans amount to an expansion of the \"killing spree he initiated in the final six months of his first presidency\".",
      "\"He's already shown us that he will act on these promises,\" the statement said.",
      "The inmates executed during the waning days of Trump's first administration included Lisa Montgomery, the first woman executed by the federal government since 1953, and Lezmond Mitchell, the only Native American on federal death row.",
      "What can Trump actually do?",
      "US media reported that Trump cannot reverse Biden's commutations.",
      "Trump's efforts to expand the death penalty to crimes that do not involve murder are likely to face legal challenges.",
      "In 2008, for example, the Supreme Court ruled that those convicted of raping children cannot be executed, adding that it's unclear if the death penalty could be applied to crimes in which a victim is not killed.",
      "According to the National Registry of Exonerations, cases with child victims are particularly prone to wrongful convictions, can be \"extremely emotional\" and pit family members against one another.",
      "Any further expansion of crimes that are eligible for the federal death penalty would require Congress to act and change the law.",
      "In 2024, two bills - both sponsored by Florida Republican and Trump ally Anna Paulina Luna - sought to expand the use of capital offences to include possession of child pornography, as well as the trafficking, exploitation and abuse of children.",
      "Both failed to pass in the House of Representatives.",
      "Trump is also unlikely to be able to quickly re-populate the pool of federal death row inmates, as most death penalty cases take years and are subject to lengthy appeals processes.",
      "While he does not have any direct authority over state executions, some experts have warned that Trump's pro-death penalty stance may trigger more executions at a state level.",
      "\"His rhetoric can and has spurred draconian measures and attitudes by leaders in states on several issues, including in the context of the criminal legal system,\" Yasmin Cader, a deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union and director of the Trone Center for Justice and Equality told CNN.",
      "In addition to the federal government and US military, 27 US states still have the death penalty on the books.",
      "A Gallup poll conducted in October found that a slim majority of Americans - 53% - support the death penalty for convicted murderers, up from 50% a year before."

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:41:04 GMT",
    "summary": "The report gives fresh details about the former Florida congressman's alleged payments for sex and drugs.",
    "story": [
      "The House Ethics Committee report on Donald Trump ally Matt Gaetz released on Monday revealed fresh details about the former congressman's alleged behaviour, at least one new accusation and insights into the panel's investigation.",
      "From at least 2017 to 2020, the committee concluded that the former Florida congressman regularly paid women for \"engaging in sexual activity\", had sex with a 17-year-old girl, used or possessed illegal drugs, accepted gifts beyond House limits and helped a woman obtain a passport, according to the report.",
      "The 42-year-old was first elected as a Republican member of the US House of Representatives in 2016.",
      "He resigned in November - days before the report was scheduled to be made public and after Trump announced him as his pick for US attorney general. Gaetz withdrew from consideration a week later.",
      "He denied the committee's findings and has accused it of conducting an unfair investigation.",
      "Here are four parts of the much-anticipated report that stand out.",
      "A winding money trail",
      "House investigators said Gaetz paid more than $90,000 (\u00a371,843) to women for sex and drugs, but created a complicated web of transactions that were hard to trace, according to the report.",
      "\"The committee was unable to determine the full extent to which Representative Gaetz's payments to women were compensation for engaging in sexual activity with him,\" the report found.",
      "He allegedly used his friend Joel Greenberg, currently serving 11 years in prison for crimes he said he committed with Gaetz, as a frequent go-between and logged onto Greenberg's account on SeekingArrangement.com, which bills itself as a \"luxury dating site\", to interact with young women.",
      "Gaetz also paid women directly, sometimes through platforms such as Venmo, according to the report. But the committee said he often used another person's PayPal account or an account linked to an email address with a fake name.",
      "He also obscured payments, the panel wrote. In one example, he gave a college student a cheque made out to \"cash\" with \"tuition reimbursement\" in the memo line. The woman said she received it after a group encounter, which \"could potentially be a form of coercion because I really needed the money\".",
      "Gaetz has posted on social media that he gave money to women he was involved with as gifts, not payments. The committee found that two women, aged 27 and 25, did not consider their relationships transactional.",
      "Another woman who was considered his girlfriend invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when asked if she was given money for sex or drugs, or to pay others.",
      "The committee attempted to prove Gaetz frequently paid for sex through evidence such as a text message where he reportedly balked at a woman's request that he send her money after he accused her of \"ditching\" him one night. The woman then asserted she was \"treated differently\" than other women he was paying for sex.",
      "In another message, his then-girlfriend said that he and Greenberg were \"a little limited in their cash flow\" and asked a group of women \"if it can be more of a customer appreciation week\".",
      "A few months later, according to the committee, she wrote: \"Btw Matt also mentioned he is going to be a bit generous cause of the 'customer appreciation' thing last time.\"",
      "As a Congressman, Gaetz earned $174,000 (\u00a3138,843) a year.",
      "His net worth is greater: On his most recent federal financial disclosure filed in August, he reported owning assets worth at least $575,000. His father Don Gaetz, who co-founded hospice provider Vitas Healthcare, has a fortune of about $35m, Forbes reported.",
      "Sex, drugs, and a passport application",
      "The committee also said Gaetz bought illegal drugs or reimbursed people for them.",
      "It gives examples of his alleged cocaine and ecstasy/MDMA use, but focused on what appeared to be a heavy marijuana habit. He allegedly asked women to bring marijuana cartridges to meetings and events, and created the fake-name email account to buy marijuana.",
      "A trip he took to the Bahamas \"was paid for by an associate of Representative Gaetz with connections to the medical marijuana industry, who allegedly also paid for female escorts to accompany them\", according to the report.",
      "One woman felt the use of drugs and alcohol at parties had impaired her ability \"to really know what was going on or fully consent\".",
      "\"Indeed, nearly every woman that the committee spoke with could not remember the details of at least one or more of the events they attended with Representative Gaetz and attributed that to drug or alcohol consumption,\" the report said.",
      "His then-girlfriend, who was 21 when they met and \"was paid tens of thousands of dollars\" during their two-year relationship\", often participated in encounters with women and acted as an intermediary, according to the report.",
      "A woman who told the committee she was 17 at the time she had sex with Gaetz twice at a party in 2017 - at least once in front of other people -  while under the influence of ecstasy. The woman, who had just completed her junior year in high school, then received $400 from him.",
      "She also told the panel she did not tell Gaetz she was a minor and the committee did not find any evidence that the former congressman knew she was underage.",
      "The age of consent in Florida is 18, although a 16 or 17 year-old can legally consent to sexual conduct with a person between the ages of 16 and 23. Gaetz turned 35 in 2017.",
      "The Department of Justice investigated an allegation that he had sex with a minor, but ultimately did not file any criminal charges against him.",
      "In 2021, Greenberg pleaded guilty to sex trafficking the girl. According to his plea agreement, Greenberg paid for sex acts with the minor and introduced her to other adult men who engaged in commercial sex acts with her.",
      "Gaetz also allegedly directed his chief of staff to expedite a passport application for a woman he was sleeping with, whom he said was a voter in his district. He also allegedly gave her $1,000.",
      "Gaetz violated House rules that bar using his position for special favours, according to the committee, which wrote: \"The woman was not his constituent, and the case was not handled in the same manner as similar passport assistance cases\".",
      "Accusations of obstruction",
      "The committee dedicated a great deal of the report to detailing how Gaetz allegedly obstructed its investigation, including failing to produce evidence he said would \"exonerate\" him.",
      "The report concluded he \"continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed\".",
      "Gaetz, who has accused the committee of being \"weaponised\" against him and leaking information to the press, alleged the panel was working on behalf of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, according to the report. Last year he helped lead an effort to oust then-Speaker McCarthy from his role.",
      "While Gaetz claimed he had \"voluntarily produced tens of thousands of records,\" he gave the committee \"only a couple hundred records, more than 90% of which was either irrelevant or publicly available,\" the report found.",
      "One sore point was a trip to the Bahamas, where the committee said he withheld information. Ultimately it concluded he violated rules on gifts because the trip was too high in value.",
      "The committee also cited the Justice Department's probe into the allegations against Gaetz as a reason for delays.",
      "Some witnesses asked the committee to use statements they had given to the department, but it refused to share them because they had not issued charges and because it said it could deter future witnesses in other cases from coming forward.",
      "Committee chairman dissents",
      "The report ends with a single-page statement  from Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Guest \"on behalf of dissenting committee members\" who are not named.",
      "Those members do not challenge the committee's findings, but disagree with releasing the report after Gaetz resigned from the House, which has not happened since 2006, they write.",
      "It \"breaks from the Committee's long-standing practice, opens the Committee to undue criticism, and will be viewed by some as an attempt to weaponise the Committee's process\".",
      "Gaetz paid 'tens of thousands' for sex and drugs, ethics report says"

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:12:51 GMT",
    "summary": "India is fast becoming a major live industry market but poor facilities at concerts have left fans unhappy.",
    "story": [
      "When Amrita Kaur decided to attend Punjabi pop star Diljit Dosanjh's concert in India this month, she was prepared to experience some discomfort.",
      "Having attended several concerts in the past, Ms Kaur was sort of looking forward to the \"exhilarating chaos\" that comes with large crowds at big events in India.",
      "But what awaited her was far worse than she had imagined.",
      "Crowd control was minimal and sanitation non-existent. Overloaded mobile networks stopped working, sparking fears about personal safety. Even using the toilet felt like a gamble, she said, as it meant having to spend the rest of the performance queued up in front of \"unhygienic, smelly cubicles\".",
      "The venue, a massive piece of government-owned land in the northern city of Chandigarh, had no public transport connections or parking space, leaving Ms Kaur with no option but to drive her car to a friend's nearby - and then get stuck in the inevitable, hours-long traffic jam once the concert had ended.",
      "\"You pay so much for a ticket and what do you get in return? A possible urinary infection and a bad headache with some bouts of music,\" she says about her experience.",
      "This year has been big for India's burgeoning concert industry, with major tours by Dua Lipa, Dosanjh and Maroon 5 packing stadiums and grounds already thrilling audiences. Other international acts like Green Day, Coldplay and Ed Sheeran are set to perform in the coming months.",
      "In fact, India's music concerts generated about 8bn rupees ($94.1m; \u00a375.3m) in revenue last year - a figure that is set to increase by 25% by the end of 2025.",
      "Young, well-to-do Indians are not just willing to pay more to see their favourite music stars, but are actively seeking out these events. In 2023, more than 400,000 people in India said they travelled to other Indian cities to attend live events.",
      "But despite the enthusiasm, many concertgoers say their experience has been far from ideal. The issue made headlines earlier this week, when a diabetic patient with incontinence issues said he ended up soiling himself at a Bryan Adams concert due to unavailability of washrooms at the venue.",
      "On the same day, Dosanjh, who has been on a nationwide tour, shocked his fans by announcing that he wouldn't perform in India again until the infrastructure at concert venues got better. The singer later clarified he was referring to only one of the venues.",
      "Since then, social media has been awash with similar complaints from concertgoers. From booking tickets on dodgy scalping websites for astonishingly high prices, to braving hours-long traffic before and after a show, often on a full bladder, fans say they have to pay with more than just money to see their favourite acts.",
      "Those who have the means are now opting to attend shows in other countries for a safer and generally more fun experience. \"At Adele's concert in Munich, the staff continuously cleaned the toilets and it was super clean even after a three-hour concert,\" says Ishika Goon, a Bengaluru-based lawyer. \"If I have to spend so much money, I might as well go for the full experience.\"",
      "Organisers and promoters acknowledge the problems but say they too are hobbled by wider infrastructural challenges.",
      "That's because India does not have enough venues dedicated to live concerts, forcing them to opt for suboptimal spaces or simply avoid certain cities altogether, all of which prevents the industry from scaling up, says Anmol Kukreja, the co-founder of Skillbox, a live entertainment company that has organised more than 300 concerts.",
      "Unlike a lot of western countries where concert venues are plenty, he says that events in India have to be held in places like malls, sports stadiums or on public land - all of which come with their own limitations and many variables.",
      "A mall might have better toilets and designated parking areas, but it won't necessarily be able to accommodate huge crowds the way a large barren ground located in a far-flung corner of the city with bad connectivity might.",
      "Nowadays, a lot of music events are held inside public stadiums to minimise some of the inconveniences - but that comes with its own challenges, such as poor sound quality, crowd management issues and lots of red tape.",
      "Government-owned venues are more suitable for big events, but the process of booking them can often be a complex \"web of permissions and licences, making them less attractive\", Mr Kukreja says.",
      "To address these gaps, organisers end up spending thousands of dollars on building temporary infrastructure at venues - the stage, temporary bathrooms and parking spaces - before each concert which could incur serious losses, adds Tej Brar, founder of Mumbai-based Third Culture and the director of NH7, one of India's biggest music festivals.",
      "And it's not just business that suffers, the live music scene is impacted too, as a whole segment of smaller and independent artists are left out because they are not \"big enough\" to make people want to pay an exorbitant price to watch them.",
      "\"If they can't pull crowds of more than 10,000 people or more, they usually won't get shows because the economics won't work for the organisers.\"",
      "But of late, even major international music festivals with star-studded line-ups and million-dollar budgets have left fans disappointed.",
      "\"Everything is fine but why can't you have clean toilets?\" asks Sreoshi Mukherjee, a Delhi-based journalist.",
      "Ms Mukherjee, who attends music concerts around the country, was particularly aghast by the lack of washrooms at Lollapalooza and Backstreet Boys, tickets for which cost anywhere between 5,000 ($59; \u00a347) and 10,000 ($118; \u00a394) rupees.",
      "\"There was a point when the loos ran out of both toilet paper and water. We had to actually buy water bottles to relieve ourselves,\" she says.",
      "Criticism against inflated ticket prices turning these events into highbrow cultural experiences meant for only a few has been mounting, but there are other accessibility concerns as well.",
      "Most venues have little to no arrangements for people with disabilities - such as wheelchair access and audio description. At Dosanjh's Chandigarh concert, Ms Kaur said they had to carry their wheelchair-using friend into the venue as there was no ramp or accessibility lane.",
      "The BBC has reached out to the organisers of all the events mentioned in the story for comment.",
      "Others in the business say there can't be a one-size-fits all solution for the problems, but they worry about its longer impact on business. Right now, people are still willing to pay. But persistently poor facilities might change their minds.",
      "\"Word-of-mouth plays a crucial role in event attendance, and negative feedback can be damaging to an organiser's reputation,\" Mr Brar says.",
      "But the onus to fix that, he adds, needs to be shared. \"While the company takes charge of choosing the location and setting ticket prices, the venue should provide fundamental amenities. Adequate washroom facilities and dedicated cleaning staff should be a venue standard.\"",
      "As the country gears up to host big names like Sheeran and Green Day, fans are hoping for a better experience.",
      "And for some, huge crowds and the risk of a potential infection still feels like a small price for seeing their favourite star.",
      "\"There's a thrill to the mess and chaos,\" says Mohammad Sami, a student.",

    "story": [
      "On a hill overlooking the city of Palermo, in Sicily, sits a lesser-known gem of Italian art: the cathedral of Monreale.",
      "Built in the 12th century under Norman rule, it boasts Italy's largest Byzantine-style mosaics, second in the world only to those of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.",
      "Now, this Unesco World Heritage site has undergone an extensive restoration to bring it back to its former glory.",
      "The Monreale mosaics were meant to impress, humble and inspire the visitor who walked down the central nave, following the fashion of Constantinople, the capital of the surviving Roman empire in the east.",
      "They span over 6,400 sq m and contain about 2.2kg of solid gold.",
      "The restoration lasted over a year, and in that time the cathedral was turned into a bit of a building site, with a maze of scaffolds set up on the altar and transept.",
      "Local experts from the Italian Ministry of Culture led a series of interventions, starting with the removal of a thick layer of dust that had accumulated on the mosaics over the years.",
      "Then they repaired some of the tiles that had lost their enamel and gold leaf, making them look like black spots from down below.",
      "Finally, they intervened in the areas where the tiles were peeling off the wall and secured them.",
      "Working on the mosaics was a challenge and a big responsibility, says Father Nicola Gaglio.",
      "He has been a priest here for 17 years and has followed the restoration closely, not unlike an apprehensive dad.",
      "\"The team approached this work almost on their tiptoes,\" he tells me.",
      "\"At times, there were some unforeseen issues and they had to pause the operations while they found a solution.",
      "\"For example, when they got to the ceiling, they realised that in the past it had been covered with a layer of varnish that had turned yellowish. They had to peel it off, quite literally, like cling film.\"",
      "The mosaics were last partly restored in 1978 , but this time the intervention had a much wider scope and it included replacing the old lighting system.",
      "\"There was a very old system. The light was low, the energy costs were through the roof and in no way it made justice to the beauty of the mosaics,\" says Matteo Cundari.",
      "He's the Country Manager of Zumtobel, the firm that was tasked with installing the new lights.",
      "\"The main challenge was to make sure we'd highlight the mosaics and we'd create something that answers to the various needs of the cathedral,\" he adds.",
      "\"We also wanted to create a completely reversible system, something that could be replaced in 10 or 15 years without damaging the building.\"",
      "This first tranche of works cost 1.1 million euros. A second one, focussing on the central nave, is being planned next.",
      "I ask Fr Gaglio what it was like to see the scaffolding finally come off and the mosaics shine in their new light. He laughs and shrugs.",
      "\"When you see it, you're overwhelmed with awe and you can't really think of anything. It's pure beauty,\" he says.",

      "There are few books in recent years that have become as big a cultural phenomenon    as Colleen Hoover's novel - it has sold 20m copies and became an internet sensation on TikTok with more than one billion tags on the app.",
      "When Blake Lively, who rose to fame in the 2000s playing Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, was cast as the main character, fans became even more excited, describing her as the perfect choice to play Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and winds up in the same position years later.",
      "Lily, a florist in Boston, navigates a complicated love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend Ryle Kincaid - played by Jane the Virgin's Justin Baldoni - and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar).",
      "Released at the beginning of August, the film became a box office success bringing in more than $350m (\u00a3280m) globally.",
      "But despite its financial success, everything wasn't running so smoothly behind the scenes. Rumours of a feud between Baldoni and Lively began swirling before the film was even released.",
      "Last week, Lively filed a legal complaint against her co-star, accusing him of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against her, something Baldoni strongly denies. Here is the story so far:",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Blake Lively accuses co-star Justin Baldoni of smear campaign",
      "It Ends With Us press tour",
      "For a film about domestic abuse, the press tour for It Ends With Us was probably not what you would have expected. There were pink carpets, flowers galore and the promotion of Lively's new haircare brand and her husband's gin company.",
      "Instead of advocacy on the red carpet, Lively highlighted fashion and florals.",
      "At the London premiere, press were told to keep questions \"fun and light-hearted\" with one event organiser telling me to \"steer away from questions on domestic abuse\".",
      "One of her remarks made at the New York premiere - \"you are so much more than just a survivor or just a victim\" - sparked backlash on social media.",
      "Domestic abuse survivor Ashley Paige criticised Ms Lively's language and told the BBC that her own trauma \"shaped my identity\".",
      "Lively was also criticised for her comments in another clumsy promotional tour video where she said: \"Grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see it.\"",
      "Ms Paige accused Lively of promoting the film like it's \"the sequel to Barbie\".",
      "Justin Baldoni's absence",
      "Alongside the press tour being described as \"tone-deaf\", people started asking questions about why the Lively and Baldoni weren't photographed on the red carpet together at the film's New York premiere on 6 August.",
      "The pair also did no interviews together during the press tour and at the London premiere, which Baldoni didn't attend, I was warned by Lively's team to not \"ask any questions about Justin\".",
      "Internet sleuths also spotted that cast members including Lively and author Hoover did not follow Baldoni on social media.",
      "Neither Lively or Baldoni addressed rumours of a feud during the press tour and the only reference to each other was Baldoni telling Today that his co-star was a \"dynamic creative\".",
      "\"She had her hands in every part of this production, and everything she touched made [it] better,\" he said about the 37-year-old.",
      "Mixed critic reviews",
      "While the film was a box office success, it received mixed reviews from critics with some saying it romanticised domestic abuse.",
      "There was a two-star review from The Telegraph's Tim Robey, who called it a \"queasy drama\" that \"repackages domestic violence as slick romance\".",
      "He suggested the film \"splices abuse and glossy courtship in the big city to deeply dubious effects\".",
      "The movie also sparked a debate on TikTok, with some saying that it's not clear from the trailer that this story is about an abusive relationship and rather it appears to be telling a love story.",
      "Based on this misconception, some people said they found the film traumatic as they didn't know it contained scenes of domestic abuse.",
      "'Smear campaign'",
      "During the film's press tour, Baldoni hired a crisis manager, Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake.",
      "Shortly after the press tour, Lively faced a barrage of criticism on social media relating to her comments on that tour as well as from old interviews.",
      "One of the interviews to resurface was one shared by a Norwegian journalist, Kjersti Flaa, who posted a video on YouTube of her interviewing Lively in 2016. It was titled \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\"",
      "Flaa has since said she had \"nothing to do with Justin Baldoni and his smear campaign\".",
      "Actor Brandon Sklenar, who plays Atlas in the film, defended Lively and said in a post on Instagram that people had been \"vilifying\" the women involved in the film online.",
      "He said it was \"disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected\" and that someone close to him who had experienced a relationship similar to Lily's had credited the film with \"saving her life\".",
      "Legal complaint",
      "Four months after the film's launch, Lively filed a legal complaint against Mr Baldoni in which she accused him of sexual harassment.",
      "The complaint also listed Wayfarer Studios, Mr Baldoni's production company which produced It Ends With Us, as a defendant.",
      "The legal filing accuses Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer CEO Jamey Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\". Some other female cast and crew had also spoken up about their conduct, the filing alleges.",
      "It also alleges that Ms Lively, Mr Baldoni and other people involved in the development of the film attended a meeting in January to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set. Her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, attended the meeting alongside her, according to the complaint.",
      "At the meeting, attendees agreed to a list of demands, including Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath making \"no more descriptions of their own genitalia\", requiring an intimacy coordinator on set at all times when Ms Lively was in scenes with Mr Baldoni and no \"friends\" of the producers and directors being on set during scenes when Ms Lively was in a state of nudity.",
      "The list of demands also implied that Mr Baldoni had asked Ms Lively's trainer how much she weighed and alleged that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath had spoken about their \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively.",
      "Plan to 'destroy' reputation",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively also alleges that Mr Baldoni and his team attacked her public image after the meeting.",
      "She accuses him of orchestrating a plan to \"destroy\" her reputation in the press and online, including hiring a crisis manager who led a \"sophisticated, coordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" against her and used a \"digital army\" to post social media content that seemed authentic.",
      "\"To safeguard against the risk of Ms Lively ever revealing the truth about Mr Baldoni, the Baldoni-Wayfarer team created, planted, amplified, and boosted content designed to eviscerate Ms Lively's credibility,\" her team wrote in the filing.",
      "It adds: \"They engaged in the same techniques to bolster Mr Baldoni's credibility and suppress any negative content about him.\"",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively says that this had led to \"substantial harm\" that affected \"all aspects\" of her life.",
      "Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.",
      "Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\"",
      "Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "Support for Lively",
      "Hollywood stars including America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel have publicly backed Blake Lively after she filed her complaint.",
      "Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel, who starred with Lively in 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, issued a joint statement on Instagram, on Sunday saying they \"stand with her in solidarity\".",
      "\"Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice,\" they wrote.",
      "Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as \"honest, kind, supportive and patient\".",
      "Baldoni's award rescinded",
      "Earlier in December, Baldoni was awarded a women's solidarity honour by Vital Voices, a global non-profit organisation that focuses on empowering women.",
      "The organisation has now rescinded the award after the legal complaint filed by Lively alleged \"abhorrent conduct\" by the actor, his studio and a crisis public relations team that it said was \"contrary to the values\" it held.",
      "And since the legal complaint, Baldoni's podcast co-host Liz Plank announced she was leaving The Man Enough show.",

      "There was his own rape and sexual abuse.",
      "When I first met Ren\u00e9, he had just escaped from Syria. That was 12 years ago. He sat opposite me, shaking and in tears, terrified of showing his face on camera.",
      "The secret police had picked him up because he had gone to a pro-democracy demonstration. They also knew that he was gay.",
      "Three of them gang raped Ren\u00e9. He begged for mercy, but they laughed.",

      "It was Father Van Der Lugt who told Ren\u00e9 - struggling in a deeply conservative environment - that he was a normal human being, that Jesus loved him whatever his sexual orientation was.",
      "Ren\u00e9 takes a glass of water, then asks to continue our conversation.",
      "Why has he agreed to show his face in front of a camera now, I wondered?",
      "\"Because the republic of fear is gone. Because I am I'm not scared of them any more. Because Assad is a refugee in Moscow. Because all the criminals in Syria ran away. Because Syria returned to all Syrian people,\" he replies.",
      "\"I hope we will be able to live as a people in freedom, in equality. I'm so proud of myself as a Syrian, Dutch, as LGBT.\"",
      "That doesn't mean he feels confident about living in Syria as a gay person just yet.",
      "Under the Assad regime, homosexual acts were criminalised.",

      "\"There are many Syrian LGBT who fought,\" Ren\u00e9 says.",
      "\"They were part of the revolution, and they lost their life. [The Syrian regime] killed them just because they were LGBT, and because they were part of the revolution.\"",
      "Ren\u00e9 tells me he is \"realistic\" about the prospect of change. He is also concerned that all religious and ethnic groups - including the Kurds - are given protection.",
      "Ren\u00e9 is among around six million Syrians who fled the country and found safety either in neighbouring countries like Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey - the majority - or further afield in Europe.",
      "Several European countries have already paused asylum applications from Syrians, following the overthrow of the Assad regime. International human rights groups have criticised the move as premature.",
      "There are an estimated one million Syrians in Germany. Among them, a remarkable disabled Kurdish girl I first met in August 2015, when she had joined a vast column of people who had landed on the Greek island of Lesbos.",
      "She travelled on through Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria on her way north.",
      "To reach Europe from northern Syria, Nujeen had crossed mountains, rivers and the sea - her sister, Nisreen, pushing the wheelchair.",
      "\"I want to be an astronaut, and maybe meet an alien. And I want to meet the Queen,\" she said.",
      "I crouched beside her on a dusty road, where thousands of asylum seekers lay exhausted in the midday heat. Her good humour and hopefulness were infectious.",
      "This was a girl who taught herself fluent English by watching American television programmes. Nujeen grew up in Aleppo and then, as the war escalated, she went to her family's hometown of Kobane, a Kurdish stronghold which subsequently came under attack from the Islamic State (IS) group.",
      "I meet her now in the bustling Neumarkt Square in Cologne, surrounded by Christmas market stalls where locals eat sausage and drink mulled wine, and the dramas of Syria seem far away.",
      "But not for Nujeen.",
      "All week she has been up watching television, long after the rest of the family has gone to bed. No matter that she has an exam for her business administration course. She will manage.",
      "Never again, Nujeen understands, will there be a moment quite like the fall of Assad, a moment of such singular hope.",
      "\"Nothing lasts forever. Darkness is followed by dawn,\" she says.",
      "\"I knew that I would never come back to a Syria that had Assad as president, and that we would never have the chance to be a better nation with that man in charge. We knew that we would never find peace unless he's gone. And now with that chapter over, I think the real challenge begins.\"",
      "Like Ren\u00e9, she wants a country that is tolerant of diversity and cares for those with disabilities.",
      "\"I don't want to go back to a place where there is no lift and only stairs up to an apartment on the fourth floor.\"",
      "As a Kurd, she is well versed in her people's experience of suffering in the region.",
      "Now, as the Kurdish forces are forced to pull out of cities in the oil producing north, Nujeen sees the danger posed by a new regime that is backed by Turkey.",
      "\"We know these people that came into power now. We know the countries and the powers that are backing them, and they're not exactly fans of Kurds. They do not exactly love us. That's our biggest worry right now.\"",
      "There is also the fear of a potential regrouping of IS if Syria's new leaders cannot achieve stability in the country.",
      "There are constant calls to family still living in the Kurdish areas.",
      "\"They are anxious and worried about the future as we all are,\" says Nujeen.",
      "\"We never stop calling, and we are always worried if they don't pick up after the first ring. There's a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen next\".",
      "The uncertainty is amplified by the change in asylum policy in Europe.",
      "Still, this is a young woman whose experience of life - the experience of serious disability since birth, witnessing the terrors of war, travelling across the Middle East and Europe to safety - has created a capacity for hope.",
      "In the near decade that I have known her, it is undimmed. The fall of Assad has only deepened her faith in Syria and its people.",
      "\"There are many people who are waiting to see Syria fall into some kind of an abyss,\" she says.",
      "\"We are not people who hate or envy or want to want to eliminate each other. We are people who were raised to be afraid of each other. But our default setting is that we love and accept who we are.\"",
      "\"We can and will be a be a better nation - a nation of love, acceptance and peace, not one of chaos, fear and destruction.\"",

      "New Mexico prosecutors have dropped their appeal, ending an effort to\u00a0reinstate charges against Alec Baldwin in connection with the fatal shooting on the set of his movie \"Rust.\"",
      "Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey withdrew the state's appeal, originally filed in November, on Monday, according to a statement from the First Judicial District Attorney's Office.",
      "\"The appeal would have challenged the Court's dismissal of criminal charges against Producer and Actor, Alec Baldwin which included involuntary manslaughter in the tragic shooting of Cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins on the set of\u00a0Rust\u00a0on October 21, 2021,\" the statement said.",
      "The district attorney's office commended Morrissey for her work prosecuting \"two cases of such magnitude and national attention, including the successful prosecution against Hannah Gutierrez Reed,\" the film's armorer, who convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. The DA's office said it \"supports the Hutchins family and their continued fight for justice in civil court.\"",
      "Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, attorneys representing Baldwin, told CBS News in a statement: \"Today's decision to dismiss the appeal is the final vindication of what Alec Baldwin and his attorneys have said from the beginning \u2014 this was an unspeakable tragedy but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. The rule of law remains intact in New Mexico.\"",
      "The decision to drop the appeal solidifies the decision by Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer halfway through trial to dismiss the case following allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Baldwin's trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammo unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers say investigators \"buried\" the evidence in a separate case file and filed a successful motion to dismiss.",
      "The district attorney's office said that under state law, the New Mexico attorney general would have carried forward the appeal, but \"did not intend to exhaustively pursue the appeal on behalf of the prosecution.\"",
      "\"As a result, the State's efforts to continue to litigate the case in a fair and comprehensive manner have been met with multiple barriers that have compromised its ability to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law,\" the local prosecutors said.",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, attorney Gloria Allred, representing Halyna Hutchins' parents and sister, who live in Ukraine, condemned the decision to drop the appeal.",
      "\"Even though the criminal justice system and case has now concluded, and Halyna's parents were denied justice in the criminal case, we will continue to fight for justice in our civil lawsuit in New Mexico against Alec Baldwin and the Rust Productions and we will vigorously continue to litigate our case in the civil court in New Mexico,\" she said.",
      "\"We have confidence that a New Mexico jury, if allowed to decide our civil case, would do the right thing and we as their lawyers will do anything and everything that is legally possible and appropriate to win justice for Halyna and her family,\" Allred said.",
      "Hutchins' sister, in a statement read by Allred in a news conference Tuesday, said, \"Mr. Baldwin must be held accountable for my sister's death. He has never contacted our family to apologize or accept any responsibility for my sister's death. We will press forward for a civil lawsuit until there is justice for her loss caused by Mr. Baldwin.\"",
      "Allred said the dismissal of the criminal case shouldn't hurt the family in civil court, noting the different burdens of proof required in criminal and civil trials. She also noted the civil case is focused on \"negligence against Baldwin and the executive producers and crew members involved in the death, which was not part of the criminal case.\"",
      "\"Alec Baldwin said recently that he's looking forward to the truth coming out, so they're looking forward to his testimony under oath as to what his truth fully is,\" Allred said. \"He has not done a deposition under oath and now is able to since what he will testify to now will not criminalize him in New Mexico.\"",
      "The shooting occurred during a rehearsal on the set of the Western film \"Rust,\" in which Baldwin stars and also served as a producer. Baldwin was holding a prop gun that had been loaded with a live round when it discharged, killing Hutchens and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has maintained he never pulled the gun's trigger and did not know it was loaded with a live round, which is prohibited by both industry and union guidelines.",
      "Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was accused of loading the gun, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. She appealed her conviction after the charges against Baldwin were dismissed, but it was upheld by a judge in September.",
      "Prosecutors had also accused Gutierrez-Reed of bringing the live rounds onto the set, but defense lawyers argued the film's ammunition supplier was not properly investigated. Guttierez-Reed maintained she did not know how the gun was loaded with live rounds. She was acquitted of evidence tampering in her trial.",
      "David Halls, the film's safety coordinator, pleaded no contest last year to negligent use of a firearm. He completed six months of unsupervised parole."

      "The complaint, which was obtained by CBS News, names Baldoni, the studio behind \"It Ends With Us\" and Baldoni's publicists among the defendants.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0first reported the complaint, which was filed Friday with the California Civil Rights Department.",
      "The complaint lays out the 37-year-old actress' allegations against her co-star, including that after a meeting in which she and her husband Ryan Reynolds addressed \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "In a statement to The New York Times, Lively said she hopes her legal action \"helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory actions to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\" A representative for Lively referred CBS News to the Times report, in which Lively denied planting or spreading negative information about Baldoni or the studio.",
      "According to The New York Times, the lawsuit also included alleged texts from Baldoni's publicist to the studio publicist which says the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "The complaint also says Baldoni \"abruptly pivoted away from\" the movie's marketing plan and \"used domestic violence 'survivor content' to protect his public image.\"",

      "Freedman pushed back against Lively's allegations of a coordinated campaign, saying the studio \"proactively\" hired a crisis manager \"due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production.\" He said Lively threatened to not appear on set and not promote the film \"if her demands were not met.\" Those demands were not specified in the statement.",
      "The film, which was released in August, is based on Colleen Hoover's best-selling novel of the same name. The book has spent 164 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and its devoted fans waited for the movie's release.",
      "However, in the days and weeks leading up to the release, rumors swirled regarding the alleged on-set feud between Lively and Baldoni. During promotion for the film, Baldoni did most of his press solo and did not pose with the cast during the film's New York premiere.",
      "Lively played the movie's main character, Lily, while Baldoni played a neurosurgeon who seems like a nice guy but becomes abusive.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" while promoting the film, Baldoni said he hoped the movie would help to create a safer world through compassion and empathy. He said he wanted men to go see the romance movie and take accountability in their lives after watching it.",
      "\"I want men to go to the theater and in some ways see a version of themselves. You have two very different characters. Both of them in Atlas and Ryle have had past trauma,\" he said. \"One handles it very different than the other and my other hope is the men who have not done the work, who have not done the work to heal, if they see bits of themselves in Ryle, have a chance to step back and say, 'You know what, I don't want to blow up my life. I don't want to hurt the person I love the most.'\"",

      "And the mastermind behind the art is David Hoey, the senior director of visual presentation at Bergdorf Goodman. He has been with the store for more than 20 years and oversees the design of the windows each year.",
      "He noted that there's no school for making window displays, and that it seems no one in the field sets out to do the job \"on purpose.\"",
      "\"We just kind of happened into it,\" he said. \"And we wouldn't wanna do anything else because we're doing a little of everything. We're doing a little theater, a little storytelling, a little advertising, a little fashion.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 12:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The visionary director talks about his recent memoir, \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\"; the epic making of his 1982 classic, \"Fitzcarraldo\"; and why he likes playing villains.",
    "story": [
      "Asked if he'd turned his cellphone off, writer-director Werner Herzog said, \"I do not have a cellphone. I don't have to turn off anything. I just want to live and have a real conversation with a real person.\"",
      "Herzog got his wish: An authentic conversation not long ago at his home in the Hollywood Hills.",
      "He is a legitimate filmmaking visionary, in Hollywood and around the world, having directed more than 20 feature films and better than 30 documentaries \u2013 from a journey to the heart of darkness in the Amazon, to a life among grizzlies in the Arctic.",
      "He's put it all into a memoir with a title that's vintage Werner: \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\" (Penguin Press).",
      "\"A title has to somehow jump at you,\" Herzog said. \"When you walk by some books and you see this, you stop: 'Man, what is this?'\"",
      "What it is, is the story of a filmmaker unlike any other. \"Yes, I have experienced a lot, as if I had lived ten times over already,\" he said. \"And that's the beauty of the memoir, is that it's so condensed. When you read it, you will not be bored.\"",
      "Born in Munich, Germany during World War II, Herzog started making films as a teen. He was drawn to characters with impossible dreams: you see it in his 1982 film \"Fitzcarraldo,\" with a longtime collaborator, Klaus Kinski. The character of Fitzcarraldo wants to build an opera house in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. To do it, he needs to haul a steamship up, then down, a mountain.",
      "Herzog said, \"20th Century Fox was interested to finance and produce a film. But they wanted to produce it with a small, plastic replica of a ship in a jungle, a 'good' jungle. And they thought, 'We should do it in the botanic garden in San Diego.' And I said, 'No, it has to be really shot in a big jungle, and big rivers, and everything.'\"",
      "Without the benefit of CGI, Herzog found his big jungle, his big river. He made the astonishing decision to pull a real 320-ton riverboat over a real mountain to the Amazon River on the other side.",
      "I asked, \"It sounds to me like there were moments in 'Fitzcarraldo' where maybe for the first time, and maybe for the only time, that you at least feared that maybe the crew stopped believing in you. Is that true?\"",
      "\"It is true,\" Herzog replied. \"There were moments where it was very precarious. And only my fire within somehow carried us. The strength of my vision carried everyone along, even though many of them did not believe I could move the ship over the mountain.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Fitzcarraldo\" starring Klaus Kinski, click on the video player below:",
      "The finished film made believers out of the crew, and the critics. Herzog won best director at Cannes, though \"Fitzcarraldo\" was nearly a very different movie. Jason Robards originally led the cast, with Mick Jagger playing his assistant. Then, with nearly half the movie shot, Robards got sick and had to be evacuated back to the U.S. The delay cost them Jagger, too \u2013 The Rolling Stones were going on tour.",
      "So, Herzog hired Kinski.",
      "He said if Kinski had been unable to do the film, he would have played the character himself: \"I would have done it. Because the main task, moving a ship over the mountain, was not cinema anymore. It was the task that I had to deliver. I had to do it. And I was struggling. I wouldn't have been half as good as Kinski, and not half as good as Jason Robards or Mick Jagger. 'Thanks, God, on my knees,' that I didn't have to play it.\"",
      "That's not to say Herzog isn't a good actor; he was born to play bad. He's starred as the villain in \"Jack Reacher,\" and a sinister figure in \"The Mandalorian.\" \"Well, I was dragged into acting,\" he said, \"but I enjoy it tremendously, and I do it well. I know I do it well, but only for very specific parts. and I can deliver. But I swear to God, it's a performance.\"",
      "His greatest performance, though, is a love story: his own. Werner Herzog is a hopeless romantic. He fell for photographer Elena Pisetski in the late '90s. To seal the deal, he sold everything he owned and flew from Germany to the U.S. with nothing but a toothbrush in his pocket and passion in his heart.",
      "\"It's only me; it's me, only me, the man, the person, and that's it,\" he said of his arrival on Pisetski's doorstep. \"So, I have nothing to offer, only me, myself. And I am in America and I'm in Los Angeles because I fell in love very deeply. And I have been very lucky. I'm not here because of Hollywood. I'm here because I'm in love.\"",
      "It's Herzog's third marriage; he and Elena have been together now for 28 years. \"I'm a very lucky bastard,\" he said.",
      "It's been 63 years since his first film, and Herzog is still at it. And, he promises, there is more to come. \"I am working on two feature films,\" he said.",
      "\"You're not saturated?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, who knows?\" Herzog replied. \"Ultimately, you'll have to carry me out from a set feet first. That's what hopefully is gonna happen.\"",

      "\"Well, it certainly is a blessed one,\" Criss laughed. \"I've had some extraordinary years of my life, and I think this has been a certainly exciting time.\"",

      "Criss said, \"I don't necessarily think of my own experience with those people specifically in my life that I have lost. But I do think about the feeling of loss, the sadness and emptiness and loneliness that that yields, because we all feel it. But the things that move me, in life and in [\"Maybe Happy Ending\"], are not the darkness of the loss, but the Herculean grace that it takes to be resilient in the inevitable truth of that.\"",

      "Growing up in the iron-rich mining town of Hibbing, Minnesota, in the 1940s and '50s, Bob Dylan was not exposed to much non-conformity or social upheaval. Except, that is, at the movies.",
      "It was at the local theaters, one of which was owned by his relatives, that he first set eyes on Brigitte Bardot, an early crush and muse for some of his first songs.",
      "\"Well, my telephone rang it would not stop It's President Kennedy callin' me up He said, 'My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?'\u00a0I said, 'My friend, John, Brigitte BardotAnita Ekberg, Sophia Loren ...' \"",

      "Seeing James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" inspired him to stand up against the shackles of Cold War conformity in his music.",

      "Dylan's first major film appearance, however, was a cameo in director Sam Peckinpah's \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\" The film spawned the classic song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" now the Nobel laureate's most-streamed song.",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:13:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Since its premiere in 1742, George Frideric Handel's 3.5-hour oratorio for chorus, soloists and orchestra has become a timeless message of hope, and a Christmas tradition.",
    "story": [
      "It's probably the most-heard piece of classical music on Earth, the most sung, and the most recorded. It's \"Messiah,\" by German-British opera composer George Frideric Handel.",
      "\"It has been in near continuous performance from 1742, when it premiered, all the way up to the present,\" said author Charles King. \"It's absolutely everywhere. And you can't say that about really any other piece of serious music.\"",
      "King's new book, \"Every Valley\" (Doubleday), gives us the backstory of \"Messiah\" and its \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" which comes about two-thirds of the way through Handel's oratorio. \"It's not the finale!\" King said. \"People start getting ready to leave, you know, grabbing their keys and their parking validation, and then it's like, 'Nope, sit down. There's a third more of this thing left to go!'\"",
      "\"Messiah\" wasn't actually Handel's idea. The words came from a friend named Charles Jennens. King suggests it should really be called Handel's and Jennens' \"Messiah.\"",
      "\"Charles Jennens was a wealthy landowner, but he also suffered from this kind of encasing sense of doom and despair \u2013 we might now call it chronic depression or even bipolar disorder,\" King said. \"He starts to pull down books from the shelves, and he starts to copy down bits of scripture. He was also working out, I think, a kind of philosophy of living.\"",
      "Conductor and writer Jane Glover has conducted \"Messiah\" more than 100 times (most recently, this month at Trinity Church in New York City). \"I never fail to doff my hat, actually, at Charles Jennens for putting that together,\" she said. \"'Messiah'\" is in three parts. The first part is the Christmas story, which is why everybody does it at Christmas. The second part is the crucifixion, but then also the resurrection; and then Part III is about redemption. So, there's a tremendous shape to this three-part oratorio.\"",
      "In the 1720s and '30s, Handel's popular Italian-style operas had made him a musical megastar. But in his 50s, his popularity was waning. So, when he was invited to stage a series of concerts in Dublin, King said, Handel thought he could restart his career: \"And so, he sits down with this text that he's received from Charles Jennens and decides to try to make something of it. You can imagine him thinking, 'Hmpf, what am I gonna do with these? I got a bunch of Bible verses in the wrong order that I'm supposed to set to Italian opera music?' But he does it.\"",
      "In his book, King describes the final product as \"weird.\" \"It is weird,\" he laughed. \"It's the strangest thing that Handel ever composed.\"",
      "Handel wrote the three-hour piece (for chorus, soloists, and nine-piece orchestra) in 24 days \u2026 260 pages of music!",
      "At the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, music curator Robin McClellan showed me a replica of Handel's original score. \"It shows the speed that he wrote. It's so messy!\" McClellan laughed. \"He really was concerned with getting his ideas onto paper as fast as possible.\"",
      "For the \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" Handel wrote the word \"Hallelujah\" once \u2026 and then used the standard jazz repeat sign that we still use today! \"He's writing down the musical equivalent of 'et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,'\" said King. \"In that era, there was really no assumption that anything would ever be performed again.\"",
      "\"Messiah\" was a huge hit in Dublin, and, eventually, in London. It seems to offer a sense of hope and light at a time when they were in short supply.",
      "King said, \"'Messiah' was born in the kind of dark shadows of the Enlightenment. Britain was at war. The infant mortality rate in London at the time was 75%. And so, 'Messiah' is a kind of piece of art that is grappling with what basis, what possible basis for hope could there be when you have all of this evidence around you to suggest otherwise?\"",
      "Just about everyone loved it \u2013 except Charles Jennens! \"He was worried that Handel had done a kind of cheap job,\" said King. \"He says, 'I am never going to offer my words to Handel again to be so abused!'\"",
      "Handel agreed to make some changes, and Jennens softened. \"In the end, he wrote to a friend of his that he thought it was 'in the main, a fine composition,'\" King said.",
      "\"Messiah\" came to the American colonies in 1770, six years before this was even a country. It was performed in Trinity Church in New York City, sounding much as it did this month in exactly the same hall.",

      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Over time, \"Messiah\" has changed in all kinds of different ways. Handel's nine-piece orchestra gave way to thunderous musical forces; various trims were implemented. Glover said, \"People sitting in a church on hard pews don't want to sit here for three-and-a-half hours.\"",
      "And whole sections were dropped. \"Some people just do Part I at Christmas; that's a very good way of doing it,\" Glover said.",
      "Still, in all its versions, Handel and Jennens's masterpiece has offered the same message for nearly 300 years: That there is always hope.",
      "\"Every single generation that has heard this thing, has felt that this music is kind of a message in a bottle for them,\" said King. \"It's a piece of music that does stuff to us.\"",
      "Its message? \"Have the possibility of hope; problems are solvable; the world is gonna be okay. And then, take that and put it into action.\"",

      "Hannon Hachett, 10, and Finlay McCurdy-Van Alstine, 11, are the dancers sharing the beloved part this year. The two are living their dream \u2014 and having plenty of fun while doing so. Both began dancing when they were around three years old. Finlay said he can't even remember what drew him to the art form.",
      "\"I think I liked all of my energy being used to do something fun, because I had a lot of energy,\" Finlay said.",

The role of the Prince is about becoming that character.\"",

      "The tally by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention involved illnesses that started on dates ranging from October 12, 2024, to November 23, 2024, with the true number of sick people likely much higher, given many recover without being treated or tested.",

    "summary": "Toy stores and the toy industry are warning that Trump's pledge to add tariffs to Chinese imports could harm their businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is pledging to slap new tariffs on imports after he's inaugurated next month \u2014 a vow that's prompting the toy industry to warn about the impact.",
      "Even if toys are designed in Europe or the U.S., they are frequently manufactured in China, a nation whose exports Trump last month threatened to target with a new 10% tariff as soon as he takes office. On the campaign trail, he floated the idea of a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods. Nearly 80% of U.S. toys are manufactured in China, according to The Toy Association, an industry group.",
      "If Trump carries through with his tariff plan, toy prices would rise \"probably instantly,\" Jennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City's West Side Kids told CBS News. She estimates that about 90% of the toys she sells are made in China.",
      "To be sure, the toy industry isn't alone in fretting about the impact of Trump's promised tariffs, as higher prices on a broad range of imports would likely be passed onto consumers. After more than four decades serving the neighborhood, Bergman fears that higher prices may threaten her shop's survival and impact her customers.",
      "\"It would be heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me. I can't really imagine not being here.\"",
      "If Trump follows through on his tariff plans, American consumers stand to lose as much as $78 billion in spending power annually on products, including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released last month.",
      "The toy industry is also sounding the alarm, with the Toy Association calling the potential tariffs \"significantly harmful\" and urging its members to contact their Congressional delegates to express their concern.",
      "Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports, but rather than being paid by the exporting country or company, the levy is paid by the importer \u2014 and much of that is handed off to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"A tariff of 60% on China would be a major shock to international goods markets,\" experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a Dec. 12 blog post.",
      "The toy industry would be one of the U.S. industries facing the worst impacts because China is the dominant supplier to the U.S., they added.",
      "\"While toys seem like products for which substitute sellers would be readily available, China maintains a dominant position in toy production for several reasons, including its not-easily-reproduced capacity to produce materials that meet US product safety standards,\" they noted.",
      "Still, some economists say Trump could use the threat of tariffs as a bargaining tool, without actually implementing the import duties. And tariffs could also encourage more U.S. manufacturing of toys and other products, although that would likely take time for new factories to ramp up.",

      "\"We are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\" Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday release. \"This cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\"",
      "Can pets transmit bird flu to owners?",
      "Oregon officials are monitoring household members who had contact with the cat to see if they develop any flu symptoms, but no human cases of bird flu were identified as of Tuesday and the risk of transmission to humans remains low in the state.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that it's unlikely for a pet owner to get sick with bird flu through direct contact with an infected pet, but it is possible. The health agency noted that in 2016, the spread of bird flu from a cat to a person was reported in New York City. The infected individual, a veterinarian, had mild flu symptoms after prolonged exposure to sick cats without using personal protective equipment.",

    "summary": "The Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, requires some businesses to register with FINCEN next month, or face fines. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "An anti-money laundering law called the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, is now back in action after a Monday court ruling that will require millions of small business owners to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by mid-January, or potentially pay fines of up to $10,000.",
      "The registration rule had been on hold since Dec. 3, when a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. But on Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the order, ruling that the decision is in the \"public's urgent interest in combating financial crime and protecting our country's national security.\"",
      "The CTA requires that the owners and part-owners of an estimated 32.6 million small businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address, by Jan. 1. With the court ruling that enforcement can proceed, many small business owners may scramble to register ahead of deadline, although FinCEN said on Monday that it is extending the deadline until Jan. 13 due to the late December court ruling.",
      "\"Reporting companies that were created or registered prior to Jan. 1, 2024 have until Jan. 13, 2025 to file their initial beneficial ownership information reports with FinCEN,\" the agency said in a statement. \"These companies would otherwise have been required to report by Jan. 1, 2025.\"",
      "Some civil liberties groups decried the ruling, saying that the regulation represents governmental overreach.",
      "\"The government cannot be allowed to maintain this unconstitutional statute, which stretches beyond Congress's proper authority to regulate Americans,\" said the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a civil rights group, said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, a FinCEN spokesperson said the appeals court ruling \"underscores the importance and urgency of the Corporate Transparency Act for national security.\"",
      "\"The Corporate Transparency Act levels the playing field for tens of millions of law-abiding small businesses across the United States and makes it harder for bad actors to exploit loopholes in order to gain an unfair advantage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Here's what to know about the ruling and the CTA.",
      "What is the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA?",
      "The CTA, an anti-money laundering statute passed in 2021, was intended to get a look inside shell companies and crack down on attempts by \"criminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in 2022.",
      "The rules first became effective in 2024, but gave existing businesses until Jan.1, 2025, to register, while businesses that began this year have 90 days to register.",

      "Businesses may also face criminal penalties of up to two years imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000, the Chamber of Commerce notes.",
      "Which businesses are exempt from the CTA filing?",

    "summary": "A government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel.",
    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving a decision to President Joe Biden, a longtime opponent of the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Mr. Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March of this year and now has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is that Nippon Steel also has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "The interagency committee reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks. Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Mr. Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "The Washington Post earlier reported CFIUS' submission of its report.",
      "Under the terms of the approximately\u00a0$14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steel-producing companies in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union has said it doesn't believe Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel had waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \"is the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "In a statement Tuesday to CBS News, the company urged the president \"to reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U.S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\"",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America's manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security.",
      "The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or puts Americans' sensitive personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel already has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 16:57:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Legislation now headed to President Biden's desk comes with the Social Security Administration staffed at a 50-year low.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly 3 million Americans will receive full Social Security benefits under legislation passed in the waning hours of the current Congress and now headed to President Biden, who is expected to sign into law.",
      "Senators voted 76-20 for the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, which would\u00a0eliminate two federal policies\u00a0that prevent nearly 3 million people, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension, from collecting their full Social Security benefits. The legislation has been decades in the making, as the Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation at 12:15 a.m. Saturday.",
      "Democrats uniformly voted for the measure, while Republicans in the Senate were split, with 20 voting to pass it and 20 voting against it. Four senators did not vote, including California's Adam Schiff, a Democrat; Joe Manchin, an independent from West Virginia; and two Republicans \u2014 Marco Rubio of Florida and Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance of Ohio.",
      "Congressional passage came down to the wire. After garnering bipartisan approval in the U.S. House in November, Senate approval came at about 12:15 a.m. on Saturday, just ahead of a continuing resolution to keep the government\u00a0from shutting down. The votes marked the final ones cast by senators in the 118th Congress before the next Congress is sworn in on January 3.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber Wednesday ahead of one of multiple votes to advance the bill. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Senators rejected four amendments and a budgetary point of order that would have derailed the measure, given the small window of time left to pass it.",
      "Republicans who spoke against the bill largely objected to its cost, noting that the measure would accelerate the Social Security trust fund's projected insolvency by about six months, now estimated to be roughly a decade away. Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act go into effect",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation's effective date involves Social Security payments for months after December 2023, according to the text of the bill.\u00a0Still, calculating what folks are due, not to mention retroactive payments, may not be simple or quick.",
      "The new law would come at a time when the Social Security Administration is operating with its lowest staffing level in more than 50 years, or since 1972, with a hiring freeze recently put in place, a spokesperson noted. Congress rejected the White House budget office's request to increase its funding, first in September and again last week, leaving it flat.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance of Ohio was among the 24 Republican senators to join 49 Democrats to advance the measure in an initial procedural vote that took place Wednesday.",
      "Without Senate approval, the bill's fate would have ended with the current session of Congress and would have needed to be re-introduced in the next Congress.",

      "That credit was designed for people who didn't get all or some of the stimulus checks when they were issued during the pandemic. Lawmakers authorized three stimulus payments, with two sent in 2020 and a third in 2021.",

      "The federal agency claims drivers were forced to use the accounts to get paid and were deceived about how to access their earnings, with Walmart threatening to fire workers who did not comply. Drivers had to follow a complicated process to get their pay, and then faced further delays or fees if they needed to transfer the money into another account.",

      "\"The CFPB's rushed lawsuit is riddled with factual errors and contains exaggerations and blatant misstatements of settled principles of law.

    "summary": "The work never ends on a dairy farm. The job is \"rewarding spiritually, not always financially,\" New York farmer Nate Chittenden says.",
    "story": [
      "As the holiday season gets underway, Americans are preparing to spend big on baking ingredients. Butter consumption, for example, grew 16% last November and December compared to the rest of 2023, according to USDA data. On average, Americans consumed 6.5 pounds of butter last year, a number that's been on the rise.",
      "Prices of staples like flour, sugar and milk have been steadily climbing for the past five years, as have the prices for many grocery items, according to the CBS News Price Tracker. Egg prices have skyrocketed 160% since 2019, due in part to shortages linked to several outbreaks of bird flu. Butter is more expensive by 29%, about in line with all grocery increases over the same period.",
      "Yet the people who harvest the milk that goes into baking essentials say they don't always benefit from the price hikes.",
      "\"Rewarding spiritually, not always financially\"",
      "Nate Chittenden starts his day taking care of nearly a thousand cows on his family's dairy farm, Dutch Hollow, in New York's Hudson Valley. His herd of Jersey cows, known for high-fat milk that goes into products like cheese, butter and ice cream, requires round-the-clock maintenance to stay healthy and maximize productivity.",
      "Chittenden, who runs the farm with his brothers and extended family, is able to pool resources with other farms as part of Cabot Creamery's co-op. Still, it can be a grueling business.",
      "\"Working on the farm every day, you get an appreciation for caring for animals, caring for another living creature, working with the land, just realizing all of this goes into making food that provides for people,\" Chittenden said. \"It's rewarding spiritually, not always financially.\"",
      "How milk is priced",
      "Farmers often sell milk at a federally mandated price to producers who process it into fluid milk, butter, cheese or other dairy products. Around 15 cents of every retail dollar go to farms, and to keep things equitable the government sets the price from farms.",
      "\"When you spend a dollar [at the store], 85 cents of it is beyond the farm,\" said Michael Swanson, an agricultural economist at Wells Fargo's Agricultural Food Institute. Another 15% goes to processors, who turn milk into consumer products, and the remainder is spent on wholesaling, advertising and other costs.",
      "\"Milk doesn't stay good for very long. You have to eat it, sell it that day or get rid of it. So [the government] wants to make sure that everybody who sends milk to a processor buyer in a district gets the same price back,\" Swanson explained.",
      "Farmers can't directly charge more money for their product if their expenses climb, and many cite increased animal feed and labor costs as hits to their margins.",
      "\"It's a struggle every year,\" Chittenden said. \"We are one big mistake away from being bankrupted.\"",
      "Hope for the future",
      "Swanson said the tide may be turning for some farmers. Dairy retail prices for consumers have been stable for the past several months, though they are elevated from 2019 levels. Other key expenses are easing as well, with lower feed costs for the past year only now getting passed down to farmers.",
      "\"This year, the dairymen actually have, year to date, 10% more revenue,\" compared to in 2023, Swanson said. Although labor \"never gets cheaper,\" he added that many farmers could be set up for a strong 2025. \"They're in a much better position right now in early December than they were a year ago,\" Swanson said.",
      "Still, for small family farms like Chittenden's, every day is a challenge \u2014 one that requires grit and a determination to keep marching forward.",
      "\"No matter how rough a day we have, you get to the end of the day, you get home with your family and you say, we're gonna do better tomorrow,\" Chittenden said. \"I don't need a pat on the back to do this job, you know, but I need people to understand what it takes to do this job.\""

    "story": [
      "Starbucks workers' strikes expanded on Saturday to include stores in Denver; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio, Union leaders said.",
      "Starbucks Workers United, the union that has organized workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores since 2021, launched strikes that started Friday in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, to protest a lack of progress in contract negotiations with the company.",
      "According to the union, the company has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. Workers United has said the latest strikes could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.",
      "Starbucks proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years, the union said Friday.",
      "In a post Sunday on X, the union said that picket lines had expanded to Brooklyn and Long Island in New York, St. Louis and Pittsburgh. Without providing a specific number, labor leaders said dozens of Starbucks stores are now affected by the strike. On Monday, baristas at several Philadelphia Starbucks locations joined the nationwide strike\u00a0against the company as well.",
      "\"We were ready to bring the foundational framework home this year, but Starbucks wasn't,\" Lynne Fox, president of Workers United said in a statement. \"After all Starbucks has said about how they value partners throughout the system, we refuse to accept zero immediate investment in baristas' wages and no resolution of the hundreds of outstanding unfair labor practices.\"",
      "Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. The company also says it already offers pay and benefits worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",
      "Strikes at Starbucks and Amazon",
      "The union also wants Starbucks to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The agency also has opened or settled hundreds of charges against Amazon. On Thursday, a day before the Starbucks walkouts, the Teamsters union\u00a0announced strikes\u00a0at seven Amazon delivery hubs.",
      "Amazon delivery drivers and Starbucks baristas are on strike in a handful of U.S. cities as they seek to exert pressure on the two major companies to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "The strikes that started Thursday and Friday followed other recent standoffs between corporate America and organized labor. Large and established labor unions secured meaningful employer concessions this year following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "But workers at Starbucks, Amazon and some other prominent consumer brands still are fighting for their first contracts. Amazon refuses to acknowledge the organizing efforts of drivers and warehouse workers \u2014 many of whom have voted to unionize \u2014 even though the powerful Teamsters union says it represents them.",
      "The e-commerce giant says the delivery drivers, which the Teamsters have organized for more than a year, aren't its employees. Under its business model, the drivers work for third-party businesses, called Delivery Service Partners, who drop off millions of packages to customers every day.",
      "\"For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public \u2014 claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers.' They don't, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel recently said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks has long resisted the unionization of its stores, but had agreed to negotiate a contract by the end of the year.",
      "Strikes \u2014 particularly ones that happen during the holidays, a time of high economic activity \u2014 can help unions exercise leverage during negotiations or flex their muscles by garnering support from workers and sympathetic consumers.",
      "Wave of union efforts following COVID-19",
      "Both Amazon and Starbucks saw a wave of organizing efforts following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic focused attention on front-line workers and the impact of economic inequality on the lives of wage-earning Americans.",
      "Employees organized at bookstores, where unions are rare, and were successful with campaigns at some stores run by Apple, Trader Joe's and the outdoor equipment company REI.",
      "But turning those wins into contracts can be a challenge. At Amazon and Starbucks, which were not unionized before the pandemic, workers have yet to secure an agreement with the e-commerce and coffee giants, which both have their headquarters in Seattle.",
      "Unions' last effort before Trump",
      "John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, said he thinks the Amazon and Starbucks workers are \"desperate\" to make progress before President-elect Donald Trump gets to appoint a Republican majority to the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to be less friendly to unions during his administration.",
      "\"The unions want to make these disputes public and bring political pressures on the companies,\" Logan said in a written statement. \"If these disputes drag on until next year, and if they are fought largely through the labor board and the courts, the unions and workers will almost certainly lose. This might be their last, best chance to pressure the companies in public before Trump comes into office.\"",
      "However, Trump has also given some signs that he might be friendlier to labor during his second term compared to his first term. Last month, he picked Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor in his new administration, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions, including the Teamsters. Teamsters President Sean O'Brien also spoke at the Republican National Convention this past summer.",
      "The Teamsters say workers at Amazon are striking at seven delivery stations in Southern California, San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta and Skokie, Illinois, because the company ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. At midnight on Saturday, the Teamsters say workers will also strike at a prominent warehouse in New York, which voted to join the fledgling Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and have since elected to affiliate with the Teamsters.",
      "Union demands",
      "The prominent labor group says it's fighting for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions for Amazon employees, many of whom experience economic insecurity while working for a company worth $2.3 trillion. It has not said how many Amazon warehouse workers or drivers are joining the striking.",
      "The union has mainly focused on organizing delivery drivers, which the company says are not its workers because they are directly employed by contractors Amazon recruited to handle package deliveries.",
      "That type of setup gives the Amazon more cover from unionization attempts in an industry \u2014 transportation and trucking \u2014 that's dominated by the Teamsters. However, the union has argued before the National Labor Relations Board that the drivers, who wear Amazon's ubiquitous gray-blue vests and drive similarly colored vans, should be classified as company employees.",
      "Meanwhile, the online retailer has accused the union of pushing a \"false narrative\" about the thousands of workers it claims to represent. Amazon has also touted its pay, saying it provides warehouse and transportation employees a base wage of $22 per hour plus benefits. It also recently boosted hourly pay for the subcontracted delivery drivers.",
      "NLRB under Biden",
      "In September, the NLRB, which has taken a more pro-labor stance under President Joe Biden, filed a complaint that found the drivers to be joint employees of Amazon. The agency also accused Amazon of unlawfully failing to bargain with the Teamsters on a contract for drivers at a California delivery hub.",
      "The Teamsters union says it also represents Amazon warehouse workers, including thousands of employees at the major New York City fulfillment center who voted to be represented by the Amazon Labor Union.",
      "Amazon objected to the 2022 warehouse election results, alleging the Amazon Labor Union and the federal labor board had tainted the vote. A regional NLRB director issued a complaint last year that accused Amazon of violating the law by refusing to bargain with the union.",
      "Amazon, in turn, is challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court along with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In June, the Supreme Court made it harder for the agency to win court orders in labor disputes, siding with Starbucks in a case brought by the company.",
      "Unlike Amazon, contract negotiation have been underway at Starbucks. The coffee chain's workers walked off the job on two occasions last year.",
      "Patricia Campos-Medina, who recently ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in New Jersey and leads Cornell University's Worker Institute at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said she expects there to be more union activity before Trump takes office.",
      "Trump's reactions will give the public a chance to see what his \"commitments are to the working class,\" Campos-Medina said.",

      "\"While a change in ownership does not automatically remedy all of the problems with the department store operation, it will allow the family and their backers to take a long term view of the business and make necessary investments and changes away from the short term scrutiny of public markets,\" noted GlobalData analyst Neil Saunders in a Monday research note.",
      "He added, \"The [Nordstrom] family have the talent and ability to enact change as does El Puerto de Liverpool.

      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses.",
      "\"We anticipate that if this integration comes to fruition, we will be able to deliver even greater value to a wider customer base,\" Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida said in a statement.",
      "Automakers in Japan have lagged behind their big rivals in electric vehicles and are trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying that the talks on closer collaboration partly were driven by aspirations of Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn to tie up with Nissan, which has an alliance with Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda and the Nissan alliance with Renault SA of France and smaller automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany's Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker. If they join, the three smaller companies would make about 8 million vehicles. In 2023, Honda made 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they would share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes centered around electrification, following a preliminary agreement between Nissan and Honda set in March.",
      "Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, is widely viewed as the only likely Japanese partner able to effect a rescue of Nissan, which has struggled following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Speaking Monday to reporters in Tokyo via a video link, Ghosn derided the planned merger as a \"desperate move.\"",
      "From Nissan, Honda could get truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "But the company said in November that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing its global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "It recently reshuffled its management and Makoto Uchida, its chief executive, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \"negative,\" citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price also has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain.",
      "On Monday, its Tokyo-traded shares gained 1.6%. They jumped more than 20% after news of the possible merger broke last week.",
      "Honda's shares surged 3.8%. Honda's net profit slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "The merger reflects an industry-wide trend toward consolidation.",
      "At a routine briefing Monday, Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said he would not comment on details of the automakers' plans, but said Japanese companies need to stay competitive in the fast changing market.",

      "The union noted that Starbucks Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol, who started in September, could make more than $100 million in his first year on the job. But it said the company recently proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years.",

The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.",
      "Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.",
      "A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.",
      "What will be the busiest travel days?",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 was Thanksgiving Day.",

Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",
      "Weather and other wildcards",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \"interline agreements\" that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",
      "\"When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,\" said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.",
      "People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.",
      "\"They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,\" and paying more to rebook on\u00a0a big airline\u00a0might be worthwhile, French said.",
      "Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays \u2014 Delta, United and JetBlue, for example \u2014 are now using the government standard.",
      "Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?",
      "A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn't pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.",
      "More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks\u00a0into a government shutdown\u00a0that started in December 2019.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.",
      "AAA advises travelers to \"continue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,\" spokesperson Diaz said. \"Airport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.\"",

The bill is expected to pass in the Senate before heading to President Biden's desk for his signature.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has cautioned that a looming government shutdown could lead to longer wait times for travelers at airport security checkpoints. The warning comes as the TSA announced it is expecting a record 40 million airline passengers to take to the skies over the two-week holiday travel period that began Thursday.",

      "Will the government shutdown affect flights?",

      "While passengers are always encouraged to arrive at the airport earlier than usual during peak travel periods, that advice could be even more applicable in the event of a shutdown.",
      "\"While our personnel are prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, please be aware that an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" the TSA's Pekoske warned.",
      "\"My advice? Arrive at your airport early, with plenty of time to park your car, check your bags and make your way through security,\" he added.",
      "The last government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days. While TSA officers were also deemed essential then, the number officers who called out sick rose as the shutdown dragged on and financial woes ensued.",
      "\"It was after TSA officers started missing paychecks that you saw the sick call numbers increase,\" said senior CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"There may not be an immediate impact at all airports, particularly if it is a short shutdown. If it drags on, then you have a workforce that is among the lowest-paid government employees,\" he said.",
      "If, in the event of a prolonged government shutdown, TSA employees stop showing up to work in significant numbers, wait times at security screening checkpoints would likely increase.",
      "What about air traffic controllers?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is already grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are responsible for securing the national airspace by guiding takeoffs and landings and ensuring that aircraft don't fly too close to one another. About a month into the last shutdown, LaGuardia Airport temporarily delayed flights\u00a0because of staffing shortages, including among air traffic controllers.",
      "In the event of a shutdown, the more than 14,000 air traffic controllers in the U.S. would be expected to show up to work without pay.",

      "On average, spending on home heating this winter is projected to increase by 8.7% to $941, up from $866 last winter. The increased costs are attributed in part to both expected colder temperatures in the Northeast and Midwest states.",
      "The new average expenditure on heating costs outpaces the $902 the average household is expected to spend on Christmas presents this year, according to a forecast from the National Retail Federation.",
      "What's driving up home heating costs?",
      "There are different ways to keep residences warm. Families that use electricity to heat their homes are expected to face the largest increase in costs \u2014 more than 14% \u2014 which will bring the total up to $1,189 from $1,040 from mid-November through mid-March, which NEADA considers to be the winter period.",
      "Driving up prices is the rising cost of updating and maintaining the electric grid. Plus, colder weather is expected to lead to increased consumption.",
      "\"It's colder, and the cost of electricity is up as the grid is rebuilt. So we're seeing both higher prices and greater usage,\" NEADA Executive Director Mark Wolfe told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Natural gas, propane and heating oil cost differences",
      "Natural gas and propane users are also expected to be hit with bigger bills this winter. Heating costs for natural gas are up just over 3%, for an average cost of $634 for the winter period, compared with $615 for 2023-2024. Costs are expected to rise only modestly in line with wholesale prices.",
      "Propane costs are up 4.4%, with families expected to spend an average of $1,231 heating homes, up from $1,179 last season.",
      "Heating oil costs, by contrast, have declined 2.7%, which means average spending this winter will be $1,518, down from $1,560 last winter.",
      "Early start to the season",
      "November was colder than usual, with temperatures dropping prematurely after a \"very expensive summer\" of heat waves straining cooling resources, said Wolfe.",
      "Blame climate change for the big swings in temperature, he added.",
      "\"Weather conditions can be very unpredictable even though over time, winters are getting warmer and summers are getting hotter. It's not a straight line, and for consumers, it's quite upsetting because higher utility bills are coming right before Christmas,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Steps to take now",
      "There are steps consumers can take to help keep a lid on home heating costs.",
      "Wolfe urges people to have their thermostats serviced now, before the coldest temperatures of the season roll in. That way, families won't be on the hook for an emergency repair if their thermostat breaks in the middle of a cold front. A tune-up will also help heating systems run more efficiently, he said.",
      "Always close the furnace flue, or else it will lead heat outside the house, advises Wolfe. Lastly, manually turn down the heat at night, if you can, to save up to 10% on your energy bill.",

      "Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo ignored customer complaints related to Zelle, with users losing hundreds of millions of dollars in scams, the regulatory agency alleges. Zelle is run by Early Warning Services, which is owned by the three banks named in the CFPB's suit, along with four other financial institutions.",
      "According to the CFPB, bank customers have lost more than $870 million over the seven years Zelle has been in operation. Early Warning and the three banks named in the complaint\u00a0hastily created the payments network to head off rival payment apps including Venmo and CashApp without adequately protecting end users, the suit alleges.",
      "\"The nation's largest banks felt threatened by competing apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle,\" Rohit Chopra, the CFPB's director, said in a statement. \"By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fends for themselves.\"",
      "Zelle blasted the CFPB's accusations as \"legally and factually flawed,\" with a spokesperson also suggesting the timing of the suit was \"driven by political factors unrelated\" to the company.",
      "\"The CFPB's headline-grabbing number is misleading, as many reported fraud claims are not found to involve actual fraud after investigation,\" the Zelle spokesperson said of the agency's more than $870 million loss figure.",

      "A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Offered by more than 2,200 banks and credit unions, Zelle has more than 143 million users in the U.S., according to the suit. Customers transferred a total of $481 billion in conducting 1.7 billion transactions during the first half of 2024, the CFPB noted.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of customers filed fraud complaints and were denied assistance by Zelle and the three banks, according to the suit, which noted that some people were advised to contact those behind the fraud to get their money back.",
      "Zelle \"has been slow to implement anti-fraud measures, including closing accounts accused of fraud,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report, pointing to the CFPB's allegations. \"It also permitted the registration of emails that were impersonating legitimate entities, including Zelle itself.\"",
      "Since Zelle launched in 2017, according to the CFPB, JPMorgan Chase received 420,00 customer complaints involving more than $360 million; Bank of America heard from 210,000 customers with more than $290 million in fraud losses; and Wells Fargo tallied $220 million in fraud losses by 280,000 people.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 12:46:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of Medicare enrollees are likely to see relief in 2025 when a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug-spending goes into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Starting Jan. 1, millions of Americans who get their prescription drugs through Medicare could get a major financial break when a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap on medications goes into effect.",
      "The yearly price cap has been in the works since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, with that legislation including provisions tackling drug costs for seniors as well as other Americans. While some of those other rules have already kicked in, such as a $35 price cap on insulin for seniors, Medicare's $2,000 drug cap will become effective starting next month.",
      "The out-of-pocket cost cap could be a \"game changer\" for many seniors, Ryan Ramsey, the associate director of health coverage and benefits at the National Council on Aging (NCOA) told CBS MoneyWatch. In the first year of the cap, about 3.2 million Medicare recipients are likely to see lower costs due to the new rule, particularly seniors who take multiple medications or have high-cost prescriptions,\u00a0according to an analysis from AARP.",
      "Before the law, there was no out-of-pocket cap for Medicare's Part D, the section that covers prescription drugs, which left seniors at risk of \"significant financial burdens,\" the AARP noted.",
      "\"Having a cap where somebody can know, 'Hey, this is what my maximum out of pocket will be for my medication,' that will be an enormous deal,\" Ramsey noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the new Medicare prescription drug spending cap.",
      "Who is covered by the new Medicare drug cap?",
      "The new $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs covers everyone with a Medicare Part D plan, which is the section of Medicare that covers most pharmaceutical products. The annual new cap also includes people with drug plans through Medicare Advantage, which are health plans offered by private insurers.",
      "There are more than 50 million older Americans who have either Part D or prescription plans through Medicare Advantage, according to health policy site KFF.",
      "Will Medicare's so-called \"donut hole\" still exist?",
      "No, according to Medicare. \"Because of the prescription drug law, the coverage gap ends on Dec. 31, 2024,\" its website states.",
      "The so-called \"donut hole,\" or coverage gap, has affected almost all prescription plans. In the current calendar year, seniors could enter the donut hole once they and their plans had spent more than $5,030 on drug costs, at which point they were on the hook for out-of-pocket drug costs until they hit $8,000 in spending. Catastrophic coverage would kick in above that amount and cover additional spending.",
      "Which prescription drugs are covered by the Medicare cap?",
      "The $2,000 cap includes all the prescriptions that are in a Medicare recipient's Plan D formulary, or a plan's list of covered drugs. That means that if a doctor prescribes a drug that's not on your formulary, it won't be covered by the $2,000 cap, potentially adding to your costs.",
      "Medicare enrollees can ask their doctors to prescribe drugs that are covered on their formulary, Ramsey noted.",
      "\"What I advise, in a situation where you are prescribed a new prescription, take your formulary to the doctor's office. Say it's a drug pressure medication, and you can say, 'Can you make sure you can prescribe something that's on my plan?,'\" he noted.",
      "In other cases, such as for new medications or drugs for which there aren't alternatives, Medicare enrollees can ask for a drug exception, which can be granted if deemed medically necessary, according to Medicare.",
      "Because formularies can change their coverage each year, and people's prescriptions can also vary over time, it's important to check your Part D plan during open enrollment each year to ensure you're in the best drug plan for your needs, Ramsey added. Open enrollment typically occurs between mid-October to early December.",
      "Do I need to sign up for the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap?",
      "No, the cap will automatically be applied to your Part D plan, and the plan will track your spending. Once you hit $2,000, the new cap will go into effect and cover your eligible drug costs beyond that amount.",
      "What costs are covered in the $2,000 Medicare Part D spending cap?",
      "The new measure will cover medications included in your formulary, as well as your deductible, copayments and coinsurance for drugs that qualify for the cap.",
      "However, the cap doesn't include coverage for drugs outside of your Part D plan, which means that it also doesn't apply to pharmaceuticals covered by Medicare Part B, which include drugs you typically wouldn't give to yourself, such as injectables that you'd get at a medical office.",
      "It also doesn't cover your Part D premiums.",
      "The cap will allow people \"to make better decisions on how to get their health care,\" Ramsey noted. Prior to this change, \"I have had discussions with people, 'Am I going to buy groceries late in the year or pay for my prescriptions?'\"",

    "summary": "House-hunters may want to zero in on these hot housing markets next year, according to the National Association of Realtors.",
    "story": [
      "Although 2024 is winding down, the U.S. housing crisis\u00a0lives on. But even as steep home prices and elevated mortgage rates sideline many would-be homebuyers, some real estate markets around the country continue to attract them.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) this month released a list of 10 local housing markets it expects to be hot spots in 2025, outperforming the rest of the country in sales. The locations have been chosen by NAR based on their current individual strengths across 10 key economic, demographic and housing factors that are considered predictors of future market activity.",
      "\"Important factors common among the top-performing markets in 2025 include available inventory at affordable price points, a better chance of unlocking low mortgage rates, higher income growth for young adults and net migration into specific metro areas,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist and senior vice president of research, in the report.",
      "One of those factors is the share of \"locked-in\" homeowners in a given area \u2014 those with low mortgage rates from previous years who are in no rush to sell and take on new loans at much higher rates. Areas with fewer locked-in homeowners were considered by NAR to be hotter than others as they are more likely to see properties listed. More listings means and more opportunities for buyers.",
      "Predictions for 2025",
      "NAR expects mortgage rates to stabilize, if not fall as sharply as some house-hunters were hoping, next year. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced its third straight cut in its benchmark rate, lowering the federal funds rate by another quarter of a percentage point. Although mortgage rates don't always mirror the Fed's rate moves, they tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, rising or falling along with the return on government debt.",
      "NAR thinks the Fed will continue to cut borrowing costs in 2025 and predicts that mortgage rates will settle around 6%, bringing in millions more buyers back to the market. The Fed is now hinting at only two rate cuts in 2025, down from its previous projection in September of four. Experts expect mortgage rates may come down slightly with the Fed's the latest reduction possibly contributing to a modest decline.",
      "The real estate group also expects home prices to rise further in the coming year, though more slowly than in 2024. The number of homes on the market is \u00a0and will continue to increase in 2025.",
      "\"Homebuyers will have more success next year,\" Yun said in the report. \"The worst of the affordability challenges are over as more inventory, stable mortgage rates and continued job and income growth pave the way for more Americans to achieve homeownership.\"",
      "Here, in alphabetical order, are NAR's 10 top housing hot spots for 2025.",
      "Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts-New Hampshire",
      "Buying a home in Boston-Cambridge-Newton area isn't exactly cheap, with home prices averaging $694,494, according to Zillow. That's more than $200,000 north of the national average home price of\u00a0$430,584.",
      "Still, the metro area has a number of strengths. For one, NAR expects the local housing market, which includes portions of southern New Hampshire, next year to benefit from stabilizing mortgage rates, which would likely mean fewer locked-in homeowners. Mortgage rates in Boston typically skew lower than the national average, according to the real estate group, which noted that Boston also has a good number starter-homes. Typically priced at 85% of the median-priced home, starter homes are critical for first-time buyers.",
      "Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, North Carolina-South Carolina",
      "In addition to 10% job growth over the last five years, Charlotte has a significant share of affordable housing, with 43% of homes priced below $324,000 \u2014 a huge draw for first-time buyers and young families. The average interest rate in the area is 6.85%, slightly below the national average of 6.89% for a 30-year fixed mortgage.",
      "Grand Rapids-Kentwood, Michigan",
      "Grand Rapids, Michigan, offers an ample stock of affordable homes, with the average home price at $271,960, while mortgage rates hover around 6.9%, slightly above the national average. But because Grand Rapids has a small proportion of mortgage originations with rates below 6%, NAR predicts fewer lock-ins and more listings in 2025.",
      "Greenville-Anderson, South Carolina",
      "With home prices averaging $307,315 and a large influx of new residents, houses in Greenville don't stay listed for long \u2014 typically about 17 days. Mortgage rates run just above the national average, at 6.9%, most likely because of recent foreclosures happening in the state, according to MorgageRates.com.",
      "NAR points to the 42% of homes categorized as starter homes in Greenville as another reason why it predicts the local housing market will be a standout for families and young professionals in 2025.",
      "Hartford-East-Hartford-Middletown, Connecticut",
      "When it comes to affordability, Hartford's average home price of $178,696 is hard to beat. In 2023, The city's average mortgage rate of 6.5% was one of the lowest among the top markets. Connecticut's capital city also has the highest proportion of homeowners surpassing the area's average tenure of 17 years, an indication of a potential increase in local inventory, according to NAR.",
      "Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Indiana",
      "Indianapolis made NAR's list because of strong job growth and housing affordability. Nearly 42% of the housing stock is priced below $236,000, with the average home value at $223,261. \"With fewer 'locked-in' homeowners than the national level, this area is likely to see more available inventory as mortgage rates stabilize around 6% next year,\" according to NAR.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri-Kansas",
      "Kansas City's generally lower average mortgage rate and smaller share of locked-in homeowners makes it a favorable market for financing and inventory. The average house is priced at $233,826, making homeownership in the area affordable for one in three millennials. Affordability plus competitive financing will make the Kansas City housing market a top performer in 2025, according to NAR.",
      "Knoxville, Tennessee",
      "One of the hottest housing markets in Tennessee, Knoxville is a place where newcomers go to settle down \u2014 roughly 50% of movers to the area decide to buy a home, NAR says. The average value of a home in Knoxville is $350,614, making this city located in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains affordable compared with other major cities.",
      "Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, Arizona",
      "The average home value in Phoenix is $414,977. The relatively affordable housing stock, plus a comparatively lower cost of living and strong job growth, have made Arizona's capital city a key destination for Californians looking to relocate. \"Demographic shifts and economic expansion has established Phoenix as a prosperous and dynamic market,\" according to NAR.",
      "San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas",
      "The average home in San Antonio is priced at\u00a0$250,834, which makes it one of the few markets to see a decrease in residential real estate costs over the past year. The city, home of The Alamo, also has had one of the strongest records of job growth in the U.S. in recent years, according to the NAR report, and it continues to attract a steady influx of new residents.",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Dec 2024 10:09:32 -0500",
    "summary": "President Biden signed legislation Christmas Eve to make the bald eagle officially the U.S. national bird.",
    "story": [
      "The bald eagle is emblematic of America. It's on coins and bills, graces the Great Seal and inspired conservation efforts that brought the species back from the brink of extinction. Though it was first used as the national symbol more than 240 years ago, Congress had never made it official.",
      "That changed earlier this year. And on Christmas Eve,\u00a0President Biden signed\u00a0the legislation declaring the bald eagle the official national bird.",
      "\"For nearly 250 years, we called the bald eagle the national bird when it wasn't,\" said Jack Davis, co-chair of the National Bird Initiative for the National Eagle Center, in a release. \"But now the title is official, and no bird is more deserving.\"",
      "It's been a long road for Haliaeetus leucocephalus, the bald eagle's scientific name, known for its striking white head and yellow beak atop its brown body. Native to the U.S., populations of the bird \u2014 which eats fish and carrion, but was also known to prey on livestock, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service \u2014 first declined due to habitat and prey loss.",
      "But it was the introduction of the pesticide DDT that contributed to the birds' near-disappearance in the 20th century. When the birds ate fish that had been exposed to the chemical, they laid eggs with weak shells. Those eggs didn't survive incubation, and populations declined to a mere 417 nesting pairs by 1963, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "The U.S. banned DDT in 1972 and, a few years later, declared bald eagles endangered. Over the next few decades, the bald eagle\u00a0populations recovered. By 2007, there were nearly 10,000 nesting pairs in the U.S. and bald eagles were removed from the endangered species list.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service puts the number of bald eagles in recent years in the hundreds of thousands. In recent years, bald eagles have charmed\u00a0birdwatchers in the heart of New York City, and eagle cams have popped up at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., at U.S. Steel in Pennsylvania and in California's Big Bear Valley.",
      "The legislation\u00a0designating the bald eagle as the U.S. national bird was spearheaded by Minnesota legislators. The state is home to what Sen. Amy Klobuchar described as one of the nation's largest bald eagle populations.",

Bob Menendez of New Jersey was found guilty this year of using his political influence to benefit businessmen and foreign governments in return for bribes.",

      "A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving a decision to President Joe Biden, a longtime opponent of the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Mr. Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March of this year and now has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is that Nippon Steel also has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "The interagency committee reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks. Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Mr. Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "The Washington Post earlier reported CFIUS' submission of its report.",
      "Under the terms of the approximately\u00a0$14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steel-producing companies in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",

      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel had waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",

      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "In a statement Tuesday to CBS News, the company urged the president \"to reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U.S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\"",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America's manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Monday vetoed a once-bipartisan effort to add 66 federal district judgeships, saying \"hurried action\" by the House left important questions unanswered about the life-tenured positions.",
      "The legislation would have spread the establishment of the new trial court judgeships over more than a decade to give three presidential administrations and six Congresses the chance to appoint the new judges. The bipartisan effort was carefully designed so that lawmakers wouldn't knowingly give an advantage to either political party in shaping the federal judiciary.",
      "The Democratic-controlled Senate passed the measure unanimously in August. But the Republican-led House brought it to the floor only after Republican Donald Trump was reelected to a second term as president in November, adding the veneer of political gamesmanship to the process.",
      "The White House had said at the time that Mr. Biden would veto the bill.",
      "\"The House of Representative's hurried action fails to resolve key questions in the legislation, especially regarding how the new judgeships are allocated, and neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate explored fully how the work of senior status judges and magistrate judges affects the need for new judgeships,\" the president said in a statement.",
      "\"The efficient and effective administration of justice requires that these questions about need and allocation be further studied and answered before we create permanent judgeships for life-tenured judges,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "He said the bill would also have created new judgeships in states where senators haven't filled existing judicial vacancies and that those efforts \"suggest that concerns about judicial economy and caseload are not the true motivating force behind passage of this bill now.",
      "\"Therefore, I am vetoing this bill,\" Mr. Biden said, essentially dooming the legislation for the current Congress. Overturning his veto would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, and the House vote fell well short of that margin.",
      "Organizations representing judges and attorneys had urged Congress to vote for the bill. They argued that the lack of new federal judgeships had contributed to profound delays in the resolution of cases and serious concerns about access to justice.",
      "Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., reacted swiftly, calling the veto a \"misguided decision\" and \"another example of why Americans are counting down the days until President Biden leaves the White House.\" He alluded to a full pardon Mr. Biden recently granted his son Hunter on federal gun and tax charges.",
      "\"The President is more enthusiastic about using his office to provide relief to his family members who received due process than he is about giving relief to the millions of regular Americans who are waiting years for their due process,\" Young asserted. \"Biden's legacy will be 'pardons for me, no justice for thee.'\"",
      "The Senate confirmed two more of Mr. Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary on Friday \u2014 giving him a total of 235 since he took office and surpassing\u00a0the number of federal judges\u00a0approved during President-elect Donald Trump's first term.",
      "Mr. Biden said in a statement at that time: \"Judges matter. They shape the everyday lives of Americans, preserving our freedoms and defending our liberties. They hear cases and issue rulings on whether Americans can cast their ballots, whether workers can unionize and make a living wage for their families, and whether children can breathe clean air and drink clean water.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders in 2023, but an earlier ruling had temporarily blocked it from taking effect while it was being challenged in court.",
      "\"The law deputizes librarians and booksellers as the agents of censorship; when motivated by the fear of jail time, it is likely they will shelve only books fit for young children and segregate or discard the rest,\" Brooks wrote in his ruling.",
      "A coalition that included the Central Arkansas Library System in Little Rock had challenged the law, saying fear of prosecution under the measure could prompt libraries and booksellers to no longer carry titles that could be challenged.",
      "\"This was an attempt to 'thought police,' and this victory over totalitarianism is a testament to the courage of librarians, booksellers, and readers who refused to bow to intimidation,\" said Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas.",
      "But supporters of the law, known as Act 372, say they will continue to fight for its implementation.",
      "\"Act 372 is just common sense: schools and libraries shouldn't put obscene material in front of our kids,\" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement to KATV-TV. \"I will work with Attorney General Griffin to appeal this ruling and uphold Arkansas law.\"",
      "The ruling comes as lawmakers in some conservative states are pushing for measures making it easier to ban or restrict access to books.",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 20:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Biden left in place the capital punishment sentences of just three federal inmates: Robert Bowers, Dzhokar Tsarnaev and Dylann Roof.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Monday announced he had commuted the sentences of nearly all federal inmates on death row, with the exception of three who did not receive clemency.",
      "There are 37 inmates initially sentenced to death who will be impacted by Mr. Biden's action and will now receive life in prison without the possibility of parole. But the remaining three on death row whose sentences are untouched are: Robert Bowers, convicted for the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue; Dylann Roof, convicted of the shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME Church; and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for the Boston Marathon bombing.",
      "While Mr. Biden campaigned on ending capital punishment and the Justice Department imposed a moratorium on federal executions, prosecutors still sought the death penalty in some cases.",
      "Robert Bowers",
      "Bowers, 51, received the death penalty in August 2023 after he was convicted of 63 federal counts for the 2018 attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Bowers shot and killed 11 worshipers and wounded seven people in the deadliest antisemetic attack in U.S. history.",
      "A truck driver who had a history of making antisemitic statements online, Bowers was armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns when he opened fire during Saturday morning prayers. Federal prosecutors said he turned the synagogue into a \"killing ground,\" and police said Bowers told them \"all Jews need to die.\"",
      "The Justice Department said Bowers \"meticulously planned\" the attack based on his antisemitic beliefs.",
      "Dylann Roof",
      "A jury sentenced Roof to death in 2017 for the mass shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015, making him the first person ordered to be executed for a federal hate crime. Nine Black parishioners were killed and three were wounded in the attack, which took place during a Bible study.",
      "Prosecutors said before Roof mounted the racially motivated assault, he posted a manifesto online that used racial slurs and expressed a belief that White people are superior to African Americans. They said Roof wanted to attack Black worshipers to stoke racial conflict.",
      "Roof was convicted of 33 counts in 2016. He appealed his conviction, with his attorneys arguing that Roof was wrongly allowed to represent himself during the sentencing phase of his trial. But a federal appeals court upheld Roof's conviction and death sentence in 2021.",
      "\"Dylann Roof murdered African Americans at their church, during their Bible study and worship. They had welcomed him. He slaughtered them. He did so with the express intent of terrorizing not just his immediate victims at the historically important Mother Emanuel Church, but as many similar people as would hear of the mass murder,\" a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit wrote in its ruling.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to review\u00a0the 4th Circuit's decision in 2022.",
      "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev",
      "Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 counts for crimes committed during the bombings near the finish line at the Boston Marathon in 2013, including three counts of using a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death.",
      "The jury recommended, and a federal district court imposed, the death penalty on six of 17 capital counts.",
      "Three people were killed and scores more were injured during the attack. Tsarnaev's role in the bombing is not disputed \u2014 his attorneys acknowledged he and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, detonated two homemade explosive devices near the finish line of the marathon. But Tsarnaev's lawyers said Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the mastermind behind the attack, and the younger Tsarnaev, who was 19 at the time of the attack, acted under his brother's influence.",
      "The two brothers attempted to flee Massachusetts following the attack, sparking a four-day manhunt that put Boston and the surrounding areas on lockdown. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested by police after he was discovered hiding out in a boat behind a house in Watertown, Massachusetts. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with police during their pursuit of the two brothers.",
      "After appealing his convictions, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit upheld nearly all of them in 2020, with the exception of three, and it invalidated those capital sentences and ordered a new sentencing proceeding.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to review the 1st Circuit's decision, arguing a new sentencing proceeding would impose significant burdens on the victims of the 2013 bombing. The Biden administration maintained that position in the case, despite the president's opposition to the death penalty.",
      "The Supreme Court in March 2022 reinstated the death sentence, finding the appeals court improperly tossed out his capital sentences.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee on Monday released its\u00a0highly anticipated report\u00a0on the findings of its investigation into former Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, detailing allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and obstruction.",
      "Gaetz has denied wrongdoing. But the report says \"[t]he Committee determined there is substantial evidence\" that he \"violated House Rules, state and federal laws, and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, acceptance of impermissible gifts, the provision of special favors and privileges, and obstruction of Congress.\"",
      "Gaetz filed a federal lawsuit earlier Monday seeking to block the release of the report, arguing that the committee no longer has jurisdiction since he left office, but the committee released it a short time later.",
      "Gaetz, who was first elected in 2016, resigned from Congress last month after being selected by President-elect Donald Trump as his pick for attorney general. Days later, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration, facing opposition\u00a0 to his confirmation from Senate Republicans.",
      "Here are some of the key takeaways from the House Ethics Committee's report:",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz had sex with a minor",
      "The committee says in its report that there is \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz engaged in sexual activity with a minor, detailing two alleged encounters with a 17-year-old girl at a party in 2017 when the former congressman was 35, in violation of Florida's statutory rape law.",
      "The committee said it obtained testimony from the girl, identified as \"Victim A,\" as well as other witnesses who corroborated the allegations. The report also notes that evidence suggests Gaetz was not aware that the girl was 17 until more than a month after the sexual encounters. Victim A had just completed her junior year of high school when the encounter occurred, the report says.",
      "The report says Gaetz maintained contact with Victim A, and less than six months after she turned 18, he \"met up with her again for commercial sex.\" Victim A said she received $400 from Gaetz that was understood to be payment for sex at the party, the committee said.",
      "Gaetz has previously denied these allegations and has not been charged with a crime. In a recent post on X, he wrote: \"I NEVER had sexual contact with someone under 18.\u00a0 Any claim that I have would be destroyed in court - which is why no such claim was ever made in court.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz paid women for sex",
      "The report found \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz paid women for sex and had others pay them on his behalf, in violation of Florida state law.",
      "The report lists payments to 12 different women totaling more than $90,000 between 2017 and 2020, paid via check or apps like PayPal, Venmo and CashApp.",
      "The report notes that there was no evidence that the sex acts were \"induced by force, fraud, or coercion.\"",
      "One of the women testified that she met up with Gaetz at a hotel, where he was with another man and a 20-year-old woman, and there was an \"expectation\" of a \"sexual encounter,\" after which he gave her a $750 check with \"tuition reimbursement\" written in the memo line. She told the committee that on other occasions \"he had normally sent Venmo payments.\"",
      "Gaetz has denied paying for sex. He wrote on X: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated - even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz used illegal drugs",
      "The report says there is \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz used illegal drugs between 2017 to 2019, including cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana, in violation of state laws.",
      "A number of women understood Gaetz to be a regular user of ecstasy, the report says, while some noted that they had seen him use ecstasy and cocaine at different events. The report says Gaetz appeared to set up a \"pseudonymous e-mail account from his House office in the Capitol complex for the purpose of purchasing marijuana.\"",
      "The committee noted that it also received evidence that Gaetz provided drugs to",
      "women to facilitate sexual encounters.",
      "Gaetz wrote on X: \"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life.\u00a0 I live a different life now.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz accepted luxury travel gifts in violation of House rules",
      "The committee outlines \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz accepted gifts exceeding the amount allowed under House rules, in connection with a 2018 trip to the Bahamas.",
      "Lawmakers are required to apply to the committee for a waiver in order to accept gifts that surpass a certain cost threshold. The committee said for Gaetz, a flight on a private plane, lodging, meal expenses and entertainment expenses on the trip exceeded the limit.",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz used the power of his office to help a sexual partner get an expedited passport",
      "The panel alleges that Gaetz falsely indicated to the State Department that a woman whom he had engaged in sexual activity with was a constituent, and asked his chief of staff to assist her in getting a passport on an expedited basis.",
      "\"The woman was not his constituent, and the case was not handled in the same manner as similar passport assistance cases,\" the report says, calling it a violation of House regulations and laws governing the use of official resources.",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz tried to obstruct the committee's investigation",
      "The report says Gaetz was uncooperative throughout the committee's investigation, provided \"minimal documentation\" in response to its requests, and did not agree to a voluntary interview or appear before the committee after a subpoena for his testimony.",
      "The committee says it found \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz engaged in \"obstructive conduct\" when it came to the investigation.",
      "\"Representative Gaetz pointed to evidence that would 'exonerate' him yet failed to produce any such materials,\" the report says. \"Representative Gaetz continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who briefly stood to become President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be attorney general, was found by congressional ethics investigators to have paid numerous women \u2014 including a 17-year-old girl \u2014 for sex, and to have purchased and used illegal drugs, including from his Capitol Hill office.",
      "Those are among the findings of the long-running investigation by the House Ethics Committee into Gaetz, which concluded the former Florida congressman violated multiple state laws related to sexual misconduct while in office. The\u00a0full report was released by the committee Monday.",
      "\"The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the 37-page report concludes.",
      "On Monday, Gaetz filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block the release of the report, saying that he is now a private citizen and not subject to the jurisdiction of the committee. The committee\u00a0released it a short time later.",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress in November after Trump announced plans to nominate him for attorney general. But facing opposition from some fellow Republicans, Gaetz withdrew from consideration a week later. The release of the ethics report brings to a close \u2014 at least for now \u2014 Gaetz's incendiary tenure on Capitol Hill, where he became one of the most vocal and provocative members of the pro-Trump faction in Congress.",
      "Gaetz has denied any improper conduct and asserted the claims were a \"smear\" invented by his political enemies. The committee said the congressman refused to sit for sworn testimony, though he did submit written answers to some of the committee's questions.",
      "The report gives fresh voice to allegations of misconduct that have circulated around Gaetz for years, in spite of his firm denials. It draws on testimony from witnesses who told the committee they were paid to have sex with Gaetz, text messages discussing the transactions, and Venmo and PayPal receipts.",
      "Among the report's most lurid findings were the allegations of sex- and drug-fueled parties and travel, including a 2018 trip to the Bahamas where witnesses say he took ecstasy and had sex with four women.",
      "\"From 2017 to 2020, Representative Gaetz made tens of thousands of dollars in payments to women that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use,\" noted the report, which lists payments totaling more than $90,000 to 12 different women.",
      "The committee said it also received testimony that at a 2017 party, Gaetz twice had sex with \"Victim A,\" who was 17 years old at the time and had just completed her junior year in high school.",
      "\"Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex,\" the committee wrote. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "In his written responses to the committee, Gaetz denied having sex with a minor. The Department of Justice previously investigated Gaetz for violating sex trafficking laws but did not bring charges. The committee said it did not find sufficient evidence Gaetz violated the federal sex trafficking statute because although he transported women across state lines for the purpose of sex, those women were all 18 or older at the time.",
      "The report noted that while all the women who testified said the sexual encounters with Gaetz were consensual, one woman told the committee the use of drugs at the parties and events they attended may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\"",
      "Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report also found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz engaged in rampant illicit drug use. The committee said it obtained text messages he sent where he referred to drugs as \"party favors,\" \"rolls\" or \"vitamins.\" It also said he created a fake email from his Capitol Hill office \"for the purpose of purchasing marijuana.\" The report noted that Gaetz had denied using illicit drugs in his written answers to the committee.",
      "In a statement\u00a0posted on X last week,\u00a0 Gaetz said: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated - even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years. It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.\"",
      "In addition to sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, the report also accused Gaetz of accepting gifts of luxury travel in excess of permissible limits with the 2018 trip to the Bahamas. And it said he arranged for his chief of staff to assist a woman with whom he had engaged in sexual activity in obtaining a passport, falsely indicating to the State Department that she was one of his constituents.",
      "In his lawsuit Monday, Gaetz argued: \"The Committee's apparent intention to release its report after explicitly acknowledging it lacks jurisdiction over former members, its failure to follow constitutional notions of due process, and failure to adhere to its own procedural rules and precedent represents an unprecedented overreach that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections.\"",
      "Gaetz told conservative personality Charlie Kirk last month that he plans to spend the coming years \"fighting for President Trump.\"",
      "\"I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress,\" Gaetz said, though last week, he floated in a post on X the idea of returning to participate in the election for House speaker.",
      "The House Ethics Committee had initially voted to keep the report under wraps, but reversed course in a secret vote earlier this month. Two Republican members of the committee were among those who voted for its release, according to two sources familiar with the vote. The committee has 10 members, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.",

      "We are just three days away from Christmas and the start of Hanukkah. Congress has gone home, but is last week's chaos on Capitol Hill an omen of what is ahead in 2025?",
      "Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales is here in studio to answer that.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES (R-Texas): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we just saw turmoil within the party over the past few days after president-elect Trump and Elon Musk scuttled this bipartisan deal, then demanded another deal that couldn't get enough Republican support to get over the finish line.",
      "Then we have this emergency stopgap measure that only takes us through mid- March. You are one of 34 Republicans to vote against it. Why?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: It's pretty simple. My constituents were against the C.R. just as much as I was against the C.R.",
      "It's been a tough week, though. It started with the tragic shooting in Madison, Wisconsin. I have worked in a very bipartisan manner to make sure we have a national strategy that prevents against some of the school shootings that are occurring. I have been working with others to get that done. I think that's important.",
      "And then, in the House, of course, we had this messy bill that was put on the floor. It started with a 1,500-page bill. In my eyes, there's no doubt that there's a sickness in D.C., and that sickness isn't going to be cured with these big, long, pork-filled bills.",
      "You do got to give President Trump a lot of credit, though. He was able to whittle that down to 116 pages. Once again, the reason I voted no is, I think C.R.s are terrible. They do nothing but kick the can down the road. Let's fast forward to March. Do you think we're going to be any closer to coming up with a spending deal then than we are now? I don't think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But if the government had shut down, the Border Patrol agents who live in your district wouldn't have received paychecks.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Right.",
      "That's why we should have done our job, instead of just saying, hey, give us three more months, and I promise you, in three months, we're going to do our job. We have ran that play before.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: We're \u2013 in my eyes, you use Christmas. You use New Year's. You lock everybody in a room and you say, let's get it done now.",
      "There's also a bigger danger to this, too, is, if we're not funding the government long term\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: \u2026 now all of a sudden, you're telling the government you have to spend a year's worth of money in six months or three months. That's not fair to any of these agencies as well.",
      "So, basically, it was a vote on my end to say, let's do our job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, which the Republicans who are in leadership had failed to get some of those bills done. In fact, Speaker Johnson chose to go this route with the C.R.",
      "But I want to ask you about the dynamic here because it's confusing, frankly. I mean, Elon Musk is tweeting against bipartisan deals negotiated and led by the speaker of the House. What role exactly is he playing here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: It's kind of interesting. We have a president. We have a vice president. We have a speaker. And it feels like - - as if Elon Musk is our prime minister.",
      "And I spoke with Elon a couple of times this week. I think many of us\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unelected.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Well, unelected.",
      "But, I mean, he has a voice. And I think a lot of \u2013 large part of that voice is a reflection of the voice of the people. Once again, these \u2013 a 1,500-page bill, how does that pass the smell test? It's absolutely wrong. It's what's wrong with this place. So we have to get back to regular order.",
      "The other part of it too is, while House Republicans were fighting over this spending bill, guess what Senate Democrats were doing?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: They were ensuring that President Biden got his 235th liberal judge over the finish line. That's why it's so important that House Republicans stay united, stay laser-focused on delivering on a President Trump agenda next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Republicans in the House are clearly not united. And it was Speaker Johnson who led that bipartisan deal.",
      "Do you support him if \u2013 he's standing for reelection. Should he still lead the party, if you're saying he was leading in the wrong direction with a 15-page (sic) initial funding deal?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Yes. And I do. I do support Speaker Johnson. I think he's done a fantastic job keeping us all together. It's like feral cats on the House, right?",
      "So that's a tough job to begin with. But the fact that he was able to work with President Trump in order to whittle it down to a little over 100 pages, the fact that he was able to work with \u2013 with Elon Musk and some of these other folks, other members to find a solution just goes to prove that he's found a way.",
      "But there also \u2013 this can't be the norm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: This cannot be the norm. Once again, that's the reason why I voted against the C.R. is, this cannot be the norm. We have to get back to regular order and pass our appropriations bills.",
      "Homeland security is certainly important to us. There's other things that are going on in the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, because the Republican majority now is so thin, it will also be thin in the new Congress. But, right now, any missed vote gets a lot of attention.",
      "Congresswoman Kay Granger hasn't cast a vote since July. And there was a local reporter in Dallas who looked into this and found the 81-year-old has been living in a local memory care and assisted living facility for some time. That was not shared with the public.",
      "Were you and others in the Texas delegation aware?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I wasn't aware.",
      "I think there's no doubt a lot of us knew that she was gaining in age, like a lot of members do. And, sadly, some of these members wait until it's too long \u2013 too \u2013 too \u2013 things have gone too far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And leadership allowed for it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I think it's maybe \u2013 I'm not too sure what leadership knew on it or didn't know on it.",
      "I'd say, on the other side of the aisle, it's the same thing. I mean, we saw what happened on the Senate side with Senator Feinstein and some of these others that have missed votes for a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I think this goes \u2013 gets back to the root of it. Congress should do its job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And if you can't do your job, maybe you shouldn't be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, she wasn't there. And, apparently, it went either unnoticed or just not acknowledged to the public, which certainly raises eyebrows.",
      "I need to get to the border, because that is \u2013 you have, what, 800 miles of the border in your district.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Border Patrol had fewer than 50,000 apprehensions at the southern border last month. That's a Biden era low.",
      "Does that mean, coming into office, that essentially the crisis has been fixed before Donald Trump even arrives, and that it's not as big of a project as initially thought?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Oh, no, it's a huge project. And while the Biden administration has started to do some things right, the Trump administration is going to do everything right, in this manner.",
      "And I will tell you why. This is why it's important. Earlier this week, I had a classified briefing on the threat \u2013 the worldwide threats to homeland \u2013 to our homeland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I won't share some of the sensitive stuff, but I will share some of the open-source stuff in Syria. A lot of us are rooting for a free Syria.",
      "A free Syria brings a lot of opportunities for first ability in that region, but it also brings a national security threat. Assad was a bad guy. He imprisoned a lot of folks, sometimes wrongfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Some of those folks are terrorists. Now they are loose. Where are they? Where are they going?",
      "Well, let's bring it back to the southern border. This year, the Biden administration has apprehended 600 Syrians. Does that mean all those Syrians are terrorists?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Of course not.",
      "But do we know who these people are and who are \u2013 and are they coming into our country? This is something that President Trump is going to get to the bottom of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want to halt refugee admissions, like Donald Trump is talking about? You want to block travel from Muslim-majority countries, like the Trump team is talking about?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I want \u2013 I want the president \u2013 I want the president to enforce the laws that we have on the books, that simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no? Those aren't laws on the books.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: It\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Refugees are accepted in the United States of America.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And they should be, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I want us to follow our laws, right? And if \u2013 and if we need to make changes to our laws, Congress should be the body to make those changes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And in my eyes, we can both protect those that are warm and welcoming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: We want people to come and live the American dream, those that are fleeing political persecution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: But we also have to go after the criminals and the terrorists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Tony Gonzales, good to have you here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Thank you. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, we sat down with outgoing DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to get his thoughts on the homeland security challenges facing the new next administration.",
      "Here's part of our conversation.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We recently saw that killing of the UnitedHealthcare division CEO on the streets of Manhattan.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors called it a killing that was intended to evoke terror. Would you consider him a terrorist? Is this domestic violent extremism?",
      "ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security): The rhetoric on social media following that \u2013 that murder is extraordinarily alarming.",
      "It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country. And, unfortunately, we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists. The threat of it in the United States is one of the great threat streams that we must counter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you say something's bubbling, what's the national trend that you're seeing?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: I \u2013 look, we have been concerned about the rhetoric on social media for some time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's against CEOs? That's against the government? That's against leadership?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We've seen narratives of hate. We've seen narratives of anti-government sentiment. We've seen personal grievances.",
      "And the language of violence accompanying or being a part of those narratives is something that we're very concerned about that. That is a heightened threat environment. I still am alarmed, though, by the heroism that is being attributed to an alleged murderer of a father of two children on the streets in New York City.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a lot of that seems to be around the health care industry and what that company was doing. It's depersonalized. The victim is depersonalized.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And \u2013 and the victim is a person.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And the victim is a husband, and the victim is a father.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation has been to the border, toured some of the federal facilities, and we saw some of those small children who came across without parents and without caregivers.",
      "And I don't think \u2013 I certainly won't ever forget that. There were also children who were separated from their families by the Trump administration. The last report we saw shows that Homeland Security reunified just short of 800 children with their parents.",
      "Why is it so hard to reunite families? And how much unfinished business are you leaving behind here?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So we are very proud of the work that we performed through the Family Reunification Task Force. But there's more work to be done.",
      "Some of the parents who were removed are difficult to find.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Some are reluctant to come forward, worried that the separation could occur again. We're dealing with vulnerable populations who have gone through trauma.",
      "So there are a myriad of challenges, some of which we have been able to overcome, as you note, for 800 or so families, but there's more work to be done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How many are left?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is unclear\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 because the \u2013 we were not left with good records. Data was not kept. And so that was also one of the great challenges that we had to overcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: ICE was also unable to account for more than 32,000 unaccompanied kids who failed to appear in court from 2019 to 2023, according to the report we read.",
      "The incoming border czar, Tom Homan, says these children are being exploited and trafficked. Is that true?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Well, we certainly\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we certainly have received reports of children being trafficked, even those as to whom we know where they are.",
      "That is outside the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: What we do is, we turn children over within 72 hours, as the law requires, to the Department of Health and Human Services, and then HHS places those children.",
      "Of course, we investigate cases of trafficking. But there are children who are reunited with a parent here in the United States or a legal guardian. And they move, and, sometimes, the government loses track. Individuals do not comply with the reporting obligations or otherwise.",
      "I think it is inaccurate to say that all of them are trafficked or victimized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In December of last year, border crossings were at record highs. Now they've dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration.",
      "How much of that drop-off is because Mexico is now stopping migrants from even getting to that southern border with the United States?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: That is, critically, one element of it. It is not the only element of it.",
      "The president took executive action in June of this year. That has been a key driver of the \u2013 the low number of encounters at our border. We are now delivering\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 to the incoming administration a southern border at which the number of individuals encountered is well below the level experienced in 2019, the last year before the pandemic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the immigration surge into the U.S. since 2021 has been the largest in American history.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is incredible. So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Oh, it is \u2013 Margaret, it is one element of the greatest displacement of people in the world since World War II.",
      "This is a phenomenon that has not been unique to the southern border of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is something that has gripped the entire hemisphere and the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you have said to me one of the very first things the Biden administration did was ask Congress to act in the earliest days.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then, fast forward, you had this bipartisan near- miss on a border bill. All that time passed.",
      "Why wait until five months before the U.S. election to put in place those asylum restrictions that did cut off the flow, that ended the crisis?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, remember where \u2013 Margaret, remember where we were when the president took office. We were in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The prior administration had imposed Title 42, which is a public health authority\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 and enabled us to expel individuals, to continue to expel individuals at the border, as the prior administration had done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: There was tremendous pressure to maintain the workings of Title 42, which we did. That held until May of 2023.",
      "We then turned to Congress, and we asked for supplemental funding that was desperately needed to make our administration of a broken immigration system work much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We were denied. We went back to Congress a second time and requested supplemental funding.",
      "Denied. We then turned to the bipartisan negotiations, which proved successful, which were then killed. The result of it, a really terrific solution was killed by irresponsible politics.",
      "Looking back now in hindsight, in 20/20, if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "Because Republicans argue in this back-and-forth over whose job it is to fix the problem, Congress would argue there was executive authority that could have been used before Congress legislated, and they point back to the crisis starting at day one, when Trump era immigration policy was peeled back, remain in Mexico, the 100-day moratorium on most deportations that was announced, the halt to wall construction.",
      "Did those measures \u2013 and I know you weren't yet in office personally, but did those measures set you up for failure?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Remember something. Remain in Mexico is touted as the great panacea.",
      "The trend lines of migration were increasing quite exponentially from 2018 to 2019. And that is reflected worldwide.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "Remember something also about the executive action that the president took in May \u2013 in \u2013 in June of this year. We also over time built capabilities that we did not previously have, not just domestically, the number of facilities that we stood up, the ability to transport individuals and decompress areas that were experiencing surges of individuals, but our negotiations with Mexico, with other countries in Latin America and around the world.",
      "We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, why didn't we hear more about those enforcement actions during the election cycle, when immigration was so key?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we've been executing on enforcement at an unprecedented level throughout this administration. And ICE just published data that evidences that quite powerfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But that data you just cited shows deportation of migrants is at a 10-year high under President Biden, a 10-year high. So what shifted at DHS that \u2013 that prompted this deportation of more than, what, 200,000 unauthorized migrants from the United States this year?",
      "That \u2013 that's one of the highest numbers in recent years\u2026",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If Congress didn't give you the power, how did you do it?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we did it with skill, with strategy, and with unflinching dedication to that mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it would also suggest that there is the ability to do it without Congress acting, right? That's the downside of showing you can make it work.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes, but, Margaret, we made those very impressive statistics happen.",
      "But there is much more work to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And what we have to do is to ensure that the problem does not continue.",
      "This broken system needs to be fixed. And it's not just to ensure that individuals who do not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States are removed, but it's also to ensure that we are providing humanitarian relief\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 to those who qualify, one of our proudest traditions, and that we are also fueling the economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said recently that this massive Chinese hacking known as Salt Typhoon, the hacking of eight telecom companies that siphoned up this metadata, the phone call records, logs and information for millions, potentially, of Americans, was accessed.",
      "Why hasn't the U.S. government stopped it?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: The intrusion is a very significant one and an extraordinarily impactful one and an absolutely unacceptable one.",
      "And the president has demonstrated a strong response to the People's Republic of China. It is very sophisticated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Rhetorically?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: I'm sorry,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Rhetorically, when he met with Xi Jinping?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Well, just recently, the United States Department of Commerce proposed a \u2013 an action against China Telecom.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So this is an ongoing situation. It is not static.",
      "The intrusion is a very sophisticated one. The telecommunications companies are working very vigorously to remediate it. They are working in partnership with us, with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency within the Department of Homeland Security, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the largest intelligence compromise, potentially, in U.S. history.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is a very serious compromise, and requires very serious action to remediate and recover from it, and also very serious response to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "How did you find it?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: That is not something I can \u2013 I can speak to.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The full interview is on our Web site and our YouTube page.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Here's some optimistic news.",
      "Our CBS News poll finds that Americans are feeling more hopeful than discouraged as they look ahead to the new year. That's up 10 points from how they felt a year ago.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We go now to Little Rock, Arkansas, and Republican Congressman French Hill.",
      "Good morning to you, sir.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL (R-AR): Good morning, Margaret. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a Merry Christmas as well to you.",
      "This was quite the journey to get you back home and to get lawmakers to wrap up business this past week. No Democrat voted against this measure to keep the government open, but 34 Republicans did.",
      "Doesn't this show that Republicans really struggle to govern when they pass things along party lines? I mean won't they need to work with Democrats in this new Congress?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think it's very, very important that Speaker Johnson and incoming Majority Leader Thune have a steady plan together to work with the incoming Trump administration to prioritize the president's priorities, our priorities in the House and Senate, make sure we're on the same page because with narrow majorities we've got to work together. And that's critical. And I think this last week demonstrated that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have a fractured conference, a slim majority. Mark Short, who was the director of legislative affairs in the first Trump administration, said this chaos shows just how hard it will be to tackle border and tax policies in 2025.",
      "What's the reality check on the timing of that and actually delivering on what Trump campaigned on?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think Speaker Johnson and, again, Majority Leader Thune, working with President Trump, wanted to use the budget reconciliation process. That's still being discussed as to exactly what that procedure will be. But I believe actually that Republicans on both sides of The Hill are united that we want to unleash American energy for future production and an all of the above energy strategy. We want to secure the border. We want to fight inflation through supply side regulatory reforms. We want to roll back those regulations that are constraining the markets and constraining private business having access to capital.",
      "So, I think we're on the same page. And I think budget reconciliation will be a way to start that process and also rein in unsustainable $2 trillion deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you can do a party line vote in the Senate there with the Republicans, but can you really get 218 Republicans to vote in the same direction when it was such a struggle just with keeping the lights on?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I think we can. I think we demonstrated that last year when we - last year, in the last Congress, when we put together the most comprehensive Republican only voting for border security for an all of the above energy strategy. Those are two priorities that President Trump campaigned on. We are united on those strategies, and I think we can get those priorities across the House floor, as well, as I say, rolling back unneeded regulatory burden on the American economy and small businesses to help fight inflation.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, look, President Biden had an executive order governing outbound investment. We've had a debate in Congress between the House and Senate on the best way to do that. We all want to limit American investment in dangerous, I would say, dual use technologies that can be turned around and hurt the - America's - America's national security. But striking that balance has been difficult. But I don't believe that was at the heart of the 1,500-page problem. I think people - a majority of members clearly wanted a simple, straightforward, continuing resolution and not what was turned into a large omnibus spending bill on top of a CR.",

And we're very excited to have Lisa McClain from Michigan, our conference chairwoman, and also Maria Salazar from south Florida, joining our committee.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, first, we need the United States to be very active, work with partners to support a free and democratic Syria. Secondly, we need to document the war crimes committed by the Assad regime as it relates to all the people murdered, killed, imprisoned, tortured, in the - from the regime, and also track down the networks that were producing Captagon. We will have support from the kingdom in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states to do that. But it needs to be stopped.",

I think they are - they have released documents before. But I think that's something they should do with a great deal of caution because you open up a pandora's box of a lot of other investigations over many, many years, conducted by that committee.

      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (I-WV): January 6th was a bridge too far for me. And I think everyone knows that. I was one of the few Democrats that went over and worked with him and we always got along great. We're very friendly. Had - just - we just had disagreements on some things. But you can do that.",

They have the power. And I think there's enough Republican senators, and Democrat senators too. That are not going to let the filibuster blow apart, they're not going to let basically run amok of the reconciliation process just to do anything they want to. It takes four Republican senators, just four. And I guarantee you, I think there's a lot more than four.",

If it's harming it in the financial burden that we're carrying because of all the illegals coming and he can tie that to it, then he'll have a pathway forward.",

So, this is the plan that the Republicans are following now that the Democrats basically showed them the pathway.",

      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, I feel - no, I feel horrible about that we had to do it in reconciliation. I feel horrible about that. But I can tell you, the United States of America has benefited from that. We didn't fall into a recession. We brought down inflation from 9 to 3 percent. We brought down gas prices from $5 to $3. We did all of that. But the supply chains were so broken because of the pandemic. The prices of everyday staple of life, food, things of that sort, made it almost unbearable for people to - for the burden they were carrying.",

      "If the White House says, I want this type of interpretation, that makes it very, very liberal interpretation. It's not what the bill was supposed to do. I said, you people are going down a primrose path, which is horrible. We didn't write the bill that way. In spite of themselves trying to liberalize and putting EVs out and all of the critical minerals, we're still depending on China when we were supposed to be weaning ourself off of China. He can fix that immediately.",

The only thing I said, you cannot eliminate your way to a cleaner environment, Margaret. You can't just say, I want to get rid of coal. I want to get rid of oil. I want no gas. I want nothing extracted. We're going to do everything with renewables. We'd be a third world country. You can't keep this economy running.",

So, the bill did exactly on energy production. You wouldn't be number one in the world right now 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, 4.7 billion barrels of oil, you wouldn't do that if we hadn't written that bill. He can take that and even go further with it. There are so many good things in that bill, then he can change it, change the name, it will be his. I'll help any way I can.",

I would say if I'm stunned by anything, it's just the amount of prisons. I mean you would almost think that if you were running a country and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret. But to have, like, 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing and yet in a way fascinating.",
      "But really the bottom line is that we have to help and - or rather work with our interim authorities, officials, to make sure we do a good search so that I can one day look Debra Tice in the eyes and tell them that our search has been exhausted.",
      "Now, in a perfect world, we're going to find Austin Tice. I think I've gone on record numerous times saying that I believe that he's alive and he's waiting for me to find him. And the president, not long ago, said that he believes Austin's alive.",

Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS, also known as Mohammed al-Golani, was described by State Department officials as being very pragmatic in those meetings today. But his group and he himself are still technically designated as terrorist under U.S. law because of prior affiliation with al Qaeda.",

      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: They were definitely helpful today. We conducted a joint search of a facility that we thought - we all thought would have a probable, I guess, have some sort of relation to Austin Tice. So, I understand, of course, their past. What I can tell you right - is that right now they're being helpful in the search for Austin.",

      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: We came up with a priority list of about six sites. And of those six sites, we felt that this had the highest probability of having held Austin at one time. But really the long - the - I guess I would say the best way to describe it is, we're just not sure. With the time that we had on the ground, it seemed to be our best shot. So, we gave it a good, hard look. We're going to review all the information and evidence that we collected, and hopefully render some more decisions about the probability. But really our job is to just to keep searching.",

Again, in the joint search that we conducted with the interim authorities today, we came across numerous documents. That's going to have to be brought back. It's going to have to be translated from Arabic into English. And sometimes these documents will actually have evidence on them. They may have fingerprints. They may have traces of DNA.",

The hostage recovery fusion cell holds primacy on these cases. People that are experts at looking at crime scenes. And they did a wonderful job of sweeping it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know back in 2020 you went there at the direction of then President Donald Trump along with Kash Patel. The regime at that time never admitted to the United States that they held Austin Tice. Do you believe they were lying back then and that the regime did have him?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: The regime, when we talked to them in 2020, they issued maximalist demands. They want - they asked for the world. They weren't really giving anything. They never admitted to having Austin Tice. They never promised to give us any proof of life, POL as we call it.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump is filling out his National Security Council with several officials who served in his first administration.",
      "Brian McCormack, a longtime energy consultant, and Andrew Peek, a seasoned Middle East adviser, will take senior roles on Trump's White House National Security Council, according to people familiar with the matter, signaling a focus on Iran and on beefing up domestic energy production.",
      "The National Security Council is an advisory body made up of regional and subject-matter experts who help coordinate domestic and foreign policy.",
      "The NSC's executive secretary will be Catherine Keller, according to multiple people familiar with the new hires. Keller was a deputy general counsel at the Commerce Department and deputy White House staff secretary in Trump's first term.",
      "Trump named Florida Republican Congressman Mike Waltz as his national security adviser less than a week after the election. Waltz's congressional chief of staff, Micah Ketchel, will be senior adviser and a special assistant to the president, one of the sources said. Ketchel previously worked for the Republican Attorneys General Association and at the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
      "Peek is Waltz's congressional national security adviser and a former Army intelligence officer. In Trump's first term, Peek was a deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran and then became the NSC's senior director for Europe. He was removed from the NSC after just three months during a security investigation in 2020. The allegations were unfounded, one of the sources said, and Peek never lost his security clearance. He has a PhD in Russian and Iranian proxy warfare.",
      "McCormack is known for having a deep understanding of energy policy after working as a top aide in the Energy Department for then-Secretary Rick Perry and later at the Office of Management and Budget. He co-founded an organization that champions nuclear power, including for military purposes.",
      "McCormack was among several aides who declined to participate in the U.S. House hearings on Ukraine during the 2019 impeachment against Trump. Early in his career, McCormack was an aide to Vice President Dick Cheney and was in the West Wing on Sept. 11, 2001.",
      "One of Trump's transition team spokespeople, Brian Hughes, will be deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, according to sources. And James Hewitt, Waltz's congressional communications director, will serve in a communications role at Trump's new NSC.",
      "In a statement in November, the president-elect said Alex Wong, a longtime Asia adviser, will be deputy national security adviser, and Sebastian Gorka will be the NSC's senior director for counterterrorism.",
      "Seats on the NSC often turn over with a new president. President Joe Biden's NSC has more than 300 people after Trump worked to shrink the group during his first term.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said as his time at the helm of the nation's immigration enforcement comes to a close that \"a really terrific solution was killed by irresponsible politics\" when the bipartisan border deal fell apart earlier this year.",
      "Mayorkas pointed to the\u00a0agreement on a border package\u00a0reached by a bipartisan group of Senate negotiators in February reached after months of deliberations that would have marked the first comprehensive border security policy overhaul in decades \u2014 and give the president far-reaching powers to clamp down on unlawful border crossings. But the bill was quickly rejected by Republicans after President-elect Donald Trump expressed his opposition.",
      "Following the legislation's failure, the Biden administration instituted asylum restrictions that dramatically cut off the flow of immigration. When asked about the timing amid criticism from Republicans that the Biden administration possessed the authority without Congress to act on the border, Mayorkas acknowledged that the administration may have taken the action more quickly if they knew the border deal would be torpedoed.",
      "\"Looking back now in hindsight, in 2020 if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly,\" Mayorkas said in an interview that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The comments come as border crossings have dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration, after reaching record highs a year ago.",
      "The Homeland Security Secretary noted that before Mr. Biden came into office, the \"trend lines of migration\" were increasing exponentially in 2018 and 2019 worldwide, \"and then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\" He added over time, the Biden administration built up capabilities that have allowed it to transport individuals and decompress areas seeing surges in immigration, saying that \"we've been executing on enforcement at an unprecedented level throughout this administration.\"",
      "\"We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four, and we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case,\" Mayorkas said.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Joe Manchin hasn't quite figured out what he'll do next once he leaves the Senate next month.",
      "But whatever his future holds, he plans to keep hosting his former colleagues Congress on his popular houseboat in West Virginia. Manchin has for years hosted politicians of both parties aboard the \"Almost Heaven,\" which has been docked in Washington, his way of bringing his colleagues on both sides of the aisle together.",
      "\"I'm going to be involved,\" Manchin told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"The boat's staying here.\"",
      "Manchin, who mulled an independent presidential bid this year, said he would have \"loved to have had a platform\" to speak centrist common sense, as he put it.",
      "He expressed hope for President-elect Donald Trump's success \u2014 despite previously saying that electing Trump would be \"very detrimental\" to the country. Manchin has said the rioting at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was a \"bridge too far\" for him.",
      "\"When the people speak and they make their choice and the election's over, you better pray with everything you have the president will be successful,\" Manchin told Brennan. \"And if you're in a position to help, you have knowledge of how the system works and can make it work, do it. \u2026 This is about our country, and I want him to succeed, and I have said this to him, I'll do whatever I can to help in any way humanly possible.\"",
      "Manchin was West Virginia's governor before he won his U.S. Senate seat in 2010. Since then, he's tried to work with both parties. He formally left the Democratic Party in May, registering as an independent.",
      "Manchin is still hoping to push a bill to ease the permitting process for the energy industry through Congress. He said he encouraged Trump to make it happen during a conversation at the Army-Navy game in Maryland last weekend.",
      "His Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024 would facilitate a faster permitting process for oil and natural gas, renewable energy, mineral mining and transmission lines. It hasn't progressed in the Democratic-controlled Senate.",
      "Manchin said he's hoping Trump will watch his interview with \"Face the Nation\" and take a serious look at his bill.",
      "\"So now with this interview, I'm hoping, I'm asking President Trump to truly look at this permitting bill, because it is basically a good piece of legislation that we've never moved this far in a bipartisan way, with John Barrasso, going to be the No. 2 man in the Republican Senate, a good person, a good friend of mine,\" Manchin told Brennan. \"We worked hard and negotiated hard, and have a good bill. It's ready to go. We have the bill ready. He could just drop it in.\"",
      "Manchin said he thinks Trump understands the political realities at play in Washington better than he did when he won in 2016. And the reality is that the Senate remains more independent than the House, he said.",
      "\"I think he understands it an awful lot better now than he did in 2016 when he won the first time,\" Manchin said. \"So now he's got some experience under him. He understands the process,\u00a0 but he understands, also, the power that he's wielding right now, the influence he has\" with the House and Senate, which will be in Republican hands in January. Manchin wants to keep the filibuster in place; it requires most bills to reach a 60-vote threshold for consideration.",
      "\"I think there's enough Republican senators and Democrat senators too, but Republicans have control because they're the majority, that are not going to let the filibuster blow apart,\" Manchin said. \"... I don't think they will do that. And it only takes five, or it takes four, I'm sorry, it takes four Republican senators, just four, and I guarantee you, I think there's a lot more than four.\"",
      "Those Republicans, he said, will \"protect the institution.\"",
      "\"They've been here long enough,\" Manchin said. \"What goes around comes around, and in two years, this thing could flip \u2014 2026, you never know. It's the power of the people.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas compared Elon Musk to an unelected prime minister after the Tesla CEO got involved in a tumultuous funding fight on Capitol Hill this week that prompted concern over a possible government shutdown \u2014 and previewed dynamics under a GOP-controlled Washington.",
      "\"We have a president, we have a vice president, we have a speaker. It feels as if Elon Musk is our prime minister,\" Gonzales said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "After days of uncertainty, Congress approved a measure to keep the government funded until mid March, which President Biden signed Saturday to avert a shutdown. But the resolution came after multiple dashed attempts to fund the government, including a bipartisan deal scuttled following intense pushback from Musk, who President-elect Donald Trump has selected to lead a new agency called the Department of Government Efficiency or\u00a0DOGE. After's Musk's criticism, Trump ultimately delievered the final blow.",
      "Musk, who spent $277 million to help Trump win the election and has since become a key member of the president-elect's brain trust, posted dozens of times on his social media platform X opposing the initial government funding measure following its release. Hours later, after Trump intervened, the deal was dead.",
      "Gonzales, who was among 34 Republicans who opposed the final measure to keep the government funded, said he did so because his constituents were against the continuing resolution, or CR, \"just as much as I was against the CR.\"",
      "\"It was a vote on my end to say, let's do our job,\" he said, arguing that there's a \"sickness in DC\" that won't be cured by \"big, long pork-filled bills.\"",
      "The Texas Republicans said he spoke with Musk a couple times during the week. And Gonzales argued that, although unelected, Musk has a voice that is in large part \"a reflection of the voice of the people.\" He also argued that Trump deserves credit for whittling the bill down from its initial form.",
      "Meanwhile, the spending legislation, along with the ensuing chaos in the House, prompted intense criticism of House Speaker Mike Johnson for his handling of the situation. At least one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, said he wouldn't support Johnson for speaker in the new Congress, while questions swirled about his ability to retain enough support to hold onto the gavel.",
      "Despite his opposition to the legislation, Gonzales said he supports Johnson as speaker, arguing that \"he's done a fantastic job keeping us all together\" and noting that \"it's like feral cats in the House.\"",
      "Gonzales said Johnson has \"a tough job to begin with,\" while adding that the speaker's ability to work with the president-elect and Musk to find a solution \"just goes to prove that he's found a way.\"",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Roger Carstens, special presidential envoy for hostage affairs,\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 22, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Roger Carstens is the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, and he joins us now from Amman, Jordan. This was a high risk visit to Damascus, the first since the Assad regime fell. Why was it important to be face to face and go there?",
      "ROGER CARSTENS, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR HOSTAGE AFFAIRS: Margaret, thanks for having me on today. You know, I think it was important because we've been in the area since about the 9th of December, shortly after Damascus fell and the Assad regime left. We flew out to Beirut, later, we restaged to Amman, and our job's been really to cast a wide net to work with partners, allies, NGOs, and even members of the media to try to cast this wide net to search for places that we believe Austin Tice may have been held over the last 12 years. But there's something about getting face to face with the people that have been searching and certainly something about getting face to face with the interim authorities to determine what's seen, to what extent has it- have these sites been cleared, and to maybe find bits of information that you're just not going to get over a phone or over email.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told reporters that you were amazed at the number of secret prisons that Bashar al-Assad had, more than 40 of them. Have those prisons been searched yet, and do you know if journalist Austin Tice was held in them?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So it's not going to shock me to find out that there are prisons that have yet to be discovered and searched. I think obviously a lot of them have been, not only by members of the general public, but also by members of this conglomerate of people that are on the hunt and search for not only Austin Tice, but people like Majd Kamalmaz, and other Americans that have gone missing. So if another, I would say, underground prison compound's discovered even tomorrow or three days from now or three weeks from now, at this point, I'm not gonna be shocked. I would say if I'm stunned by anything, it's just the amount of prisons. I mean, you'd almost think that if you were running a country and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret. But to have like 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing, and yet in a way fascinating. But really the bottom line is that we have to help, and- or rather work with our interim authorities, officials, to make sure that we do a good search so that I can one day look Debra Tice in the eyes and tell them that our search been- has been exhaustive. Now in a perfect world, we're gonna find Austin Tice. I think I've gone on record numerous times saying that I believe that he's alive and he's waiting for me to find him. And the president not long ago said that he believes Austin's alive. Our job in the U.S. government is to keep pressing and pressing and pressing to find out Austin's location, his disposition, his status, and to bring him home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're referring to them as interim authorities. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS, also known as Mohammad al-Jolani, was described by State Department officials as being \"very pragmatic\" in those meetings today, but his group and he himself are still technically designated as terrorists under U.S. law because of prior affiliation with Al Qaeda. Do you trust that they are being helpful to the U.S. now?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So Margaret, I'm- I'm not one of the policy people that render some of these decisions, that's done by people that spend years perfecting this. They're- most of them are lawyers, and I wasn't smart enough to get a law degree. But what I can tell you is that they've treated us well in terms of our search. I've been talking to them for, I wanna say almost, probably nine or 10 days, and they've been helpful in conducting the search. They were definitely helpful today. We conducted a joint search of a facility that we- we all thought would have a probable, I guess, have some sort of relation to Austin Tice. So I understand, of course their- their past. What I can tell you right- is that right now they're being helpful in the search for Austin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you conducted a joint search with HTS of a prison today. Did you believe that that is where Austin was being held?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: You know, Margaret, we had a lot of information over the last 12 years that pointed to a variety of facilities. And in necking that down over 12 years, we came up with a priority list of about six sites and of those six sites, we felt that this had the highest probability of having held Austin at one time. But really the long- the- I guess I would say the best way to describe it is, we're just not sure. You know, you can get information from Syria, which to an extent has been a black box in terms of gathering information on Austin, and with all the things, all the, I guess I'd say reports being overlaid, it becomes clear that some places have a higher probability than others. And this, with the time that we had in the ground, seemed to be our best shot. So we- we gave it a good, hard look. We're gonna review all the information and evidence that we collected and hopefully render some more decisions about the probability, but really, our- our job is to just keep searching. You know, it- sometimes it takes a while to determine whether the information is valid or not. And when we g- go to the hard work of crosschecking it, but out of all the sites that we could have looked at, out of the 40 or so prisons that we've identified, and out of the six priority prisons, we went to the one that we felt had the highest chance of giving us some sort of evidence that Austin had been there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Assad intelligence ministries were known for keeping scrupulously detailed records, numbering prison- prisoners, alive and dead. Do those records still exist? Have you gone through them to look for evidence of Austin and the Virginia doctor you mentioned, Majd Kamalmaz?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So we've had a chance to find various documents, or I would even say file folders, holding information. Again, in the joint search that we conducted with interim authorities today, we came across numerous documents. That's gonna have to be brought back. It's gonna have to be translated from Arabic into English. And sometimes these documents will actually have evidence on them. They may have fingerprints, they may have traces of DNA. So we're still in the, I would say the research phase, but the bottom line is we did find some documents. We're taking a hard look at them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this was a search you conducted along with special operators from JSOC?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would never go into talking about who I was with, but I will tell you this. I was with members of the FBI. The hostage recovery fusion cell holds primacy on these cases. My office SPEHA is involved because of the diplomatic angle and aspect. So today on the ground, we were working with members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, people that are experts at looking at crime scenes, and they did a wonderful job of sweeping it, using all their skills, talents, and capabilities to bear, to- to find the right documents that might make sense to gather the evidence that they felt might give us a- more certainty. But that's- I'll probably just leave it at that. We were with members of the- the law enforcement community, the FBI, and I think they- they were the ones that were able to give us this good look that we otherwise would not have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Debra Tice, Austin's mother, sent a letter that became public to the Israeli prime minister, asking him to have his military stop bombing prisons, because she believed her son might be in one of them. Has that bombing complicated the search?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would say, to the extent that- of knowledge that I have, no. Now I may not have full- a full picture. You talked earlier about the dis- or the difference between being in Beirut and talking to people on the phones and sending texts, WhatsApp, Signal messages, or being in Amman and doing the same. When you get on the ground and get face to face, you're able to suck in or vacuum in a lot more information. From the information that I've received, the bombing has not really impeded any of the search efforts for Austin. However, I would not want to be too firm about that because there are bits of information that I may not have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This wasn't your first trip to Damascus. I know back in 2020, you went there at the direction of then president Donald Trump- Trump, along with Kash Patel. The regime at that time never admitted to the United States that they held Austin Tice. Do you believe they were lying back then, and that the regime did have him?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: Well, what I can tell you is that the regime, when we talked to them in- in 2020, they issued maximalist demands. They- they asked for the world. They weren't really giving anything. They never admitted to having Austin Tice. They never promised to give us any proof of life, POL, as we call it. They essentially asked for a lot and said, if we're- the United States were able to deliver everything, they might be willing to have a discussion about this- this person that we're asking about, or to discuss our interests. At that time, they wouldn't even mention his name. So they were not- they were asking for a lot and giving pretty much nothing, and it made for the conversations very frustrating. I would say that at some point we came across information and that's- as highlighted by President Biden and Secretary of State Tony Blinken, that led us to believe that at one point, the Syrian government truly did have Austin Tice. Did they- did they have him until the very end? That's information we're still trying to sort through. But at one point we- we feel very confident that the regime did detain and have Austin Tice in their custody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And before I let you go, the family of Dr. Majd Kamalmaz was told by U.S. intelligence that their father likely died when he was in captivity. Is there a reason for them to continue to hope? Did you discover anything about him?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would say that if I were in their shoes, I would always want to press to- until I get something that's very conclusive. And my role is- being a part of the U.S. government, my job is to pursue- pursue as rigorously as I can, the truth. And my- I would probably tell the family, and I actually have, I- I've met the family numerous times, I've been in their homes, I've had a chance to- to break bread with them. And I always tell them, no matter what the status is of Majd, we're bringing him home one day. I think if I was in the family's shoes, I'd always have a hope that he was alive. I think the U.S. government's been firm, at least on the information that they've been able to provide about his status. But regardless, we're gonna keep pursuing Majd's case. And one day, at some point, I think we're gonna be able to put that to rest and bring him home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Roger Carstens. I know it's been an extremely long day and an extremely long effort. Thank you for sharing details with us.",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: Margaret. Thanks for having me on.",

      "SEN. MANCHIN: Margaret, it's always good to be with you. You know that, and I enjoy it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're always plain spoken, and there's a lot to get to with you. I have to start on this moment of time we are in. There's such uncertainty here on Capitol Hill about whether Congress can come to this new agreement just to keep the lights on and the government funded. After Jan- after- Excuse me, let me start again. There's concern that the government may not come to an agreement to keep the lights on after December 20. This is after Elon Musk and President Elect Trump came out against a bipartisan deal at this 11th hour. Do you think the government's going to shut down?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I don't. I don't think anybody- I think anyone's been here from 2013 remembers- goes back, when it was shut down, all the harm it's done to so many good people, not their fault at all. Innocent people in America, getting harmed because of dysfunction here in Washington. I think what you'll see, Margaret, is, if they're having a hard time getting their legs under them right now, President Trump is out there, but also he wants to hit the ground running. So he's looking, don't put me behind- behind the eight ball, if you will. So they're watching everything very closely. Unfortunately, what you're going to see is a bunch of CRs, probably, you know, right now\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Continuing resolutions.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Continuing resolution, was going to go, okay. That means we're going to continue what we've been doing, and nothing new, nothing different. And that's a very, very poor way of running a government, a very expensive way of running a government, because you should be making some adjustments to make things smoother and better and- and things of that sort. Especially the military. It's very difficult in the military. But they were going to go to March. They wanted to wait. That's what Mike- Mike Johnson, the Speaker, wanted to wait until, I think, after his January 3 election for Speaker, because he's on the thin margin here, and they're just- they're just basically, I mean, just stone cold, they just can't do anything. And that one vote vacate, he's always threatened by just one Republican and say, well, if you don't do what I want, I'm going to go ahead and- and ask for a vacation- a vacate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To oust the speaker.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: To oust the speaker, and he can be threatened with that, and that just shuts everything down. So you only have a two vote threshold over there. I think 20- 220, is what they have, 218. But what gets me- it blows my mind. They won't even think about- I know there'd be moderate centrist Democrats, 10, 15, 20 that would have no problem voting for Mike Johnson to help him, but they're saying, oh no, no, the Democrats will extract too much. Well, if you have 200 Republicans and 10 or 15, or 20 Democrats, I think they'll be more than reasonable just being able to participate, because over there, majority rules.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems, though, the direction is coming not from the elected members, but from the outside. Elon Musk, the world's richest man, was the one who came out against this short term funding deal, and then the President Elect also said, he's- that he's not on board. He's not even in office yet.",

      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, [cross talk] that was agreed upon. There was- that went through all the spending. And you know, Elon's coming in as the new DOGE czar and- and looking at that. So wait a minute, why are you doing that, when it's behind the eight ball before we start? They're- they're looking at all these things here. What they don't\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think these are regional- these are reasonable objections?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No. I can understand where they're coming from. Did I say they're reasonable? No. This Congress, 118th Congress. First of all, Mike Johnson and the Republican leadership in the House has to come to grip that's the worst performing Congress in the history of our country. That means lack of production. And I say that because most of the time there's been about 500 bills that have been passed, and every two year, it's 117th Congress, one of the most productive. 118th was not, they become in charge again. But because of that thing that you went through with Kevin McCarthy, how all that unfolded and what it left them with, they have been just tied in knots and can't get anything through. And they- they will not reach out and work for- with Democrats to continue to have a majority with some bipartisanship. If they can't get over that hump, and if Democrats can't get over that hump, that they've got to work with Republicans, when they're in charge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats did come to a bipartisan agreement on this short term spending deal, and then the President Elect said, no deal.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Right, right. So\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Democrats were working with Republicans on that.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yes, oh no, this last deal that was made here. Mike Johnson shouldn't have done an extension to March, okay, with the CR. We should have finished out. The Senate had all appropriation- 12 appropriation bills done, working with Patty Murray and Susan Collins. Those are two wonderful senators that really worked hard and did their job. And then, boom, nothing happens. And Schumer, for whatever reason, didn't put them on the floor. Should have, we should have had our package altogether. That's all doable. But I would have thought they would have finished out this year, the 118th Congress, and President Trump comes in and starts his new term on the 20th of January. That'll be the 119th Congress. But they're looking at things, they don't want to be strapped with certain things. And they- they- they have a lot of input, let's put it that way, an awful lot of influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you- you are an independent and you are independent minded.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Always have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you will object at times to\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014to what the party direction is. Will you support whatever it is that Senate leadership says Democrats should be on board with, if it's to keep the lights on?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Let me make sure you understand. I will never vote to shut down the government. There's no reason. There's- you have no excuse in the world just because it's not the right thing, not perfect enough.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But doesn't that mean that the Senate will just have to swallow whatever it is the House sends up here?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pretty much- pretty much, you're in a situation now, they just want to get out of here and not let the government shutdown and live to fight another day. I can see what's coming now. So my vote, or anybody's vote, right now, I think they're going to come to an agreement. They'll swallow hard, say, let's go home for Christmas. That's what's going to happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So whatever it is that gets sent here by the House\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pretty much, whatever it is right now, no matter what they have to do to skinny it down, they're not going to fight. There's not much fight left. Okay? The die has been cast. The election of November pretty much set the die where it's going. So whether you do it now and fight to the death now, it's going to be changing anyway when President Trump brings his new administration in. So they're just trying- President Trump and him are just trying to wield their power right now, and they have that influence with the Republican delegation, if you will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President Elect has now publicly called for the debt ceiling to be dealt with. Not clear if he wants it\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That won't happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014completely eliminated or lifted. It won't happen? Well, he says it has to be part of this deal before he takes office January 20.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I don't see the Democrats, basically- and this is going to be from a bipartisan standpoint. You have to have bipartisanship here, okay?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'll need 60 votes in the Senate to do this.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That's exactly right. And you've got 51 Democrats right now. So if you had all 49 Republicans, you'll need 11 Democrats to raise that debt ceiling. I just don't see getting the votes to do that. My reason for saying that is that's going to have to be, the Republicans do it when they take over with- with the trifecta, if you will. They're saying is, well, this debt we're getting from- from everybody that you've given us to us, and why won't you raise it now so we can go ahead and just do our work? Well, if you're going to do all the thing with DOGE, and you're going to be in charge of all of the rearrangement of government, and trying to look at the waste, fraud and abuse in government, then you shouldn't, maybe have to raise that right now, you know. So- but if you do, you have to justify why you're doing it. I would think that would be their thought process. I'm not sure what they're going to end up with. But I don't see an appetite, and I have not heard an appetite of that being thrown in. Yesterday was the first time we heard about that, and that being thrown in right now to the mix, it's either this or nothing. I don't know how they're going to get over that one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think the President Elect understands the political realities that you are talking about, that there aren't the votes?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I think he understands- he understands it an awful lot better now than he did in 2016 when he won the first time. So now he's had- he's got- got some experience under him. He understands the process and- but he understands, also, the power that he's wielding right now, the influence he has with the Republican congregation or delegation, if you will. On the House and the Senate. The Senate has always been more dependent- independent. Senators are independent to a certain extent. The six year term makes you\u00a0 a little bit more independent, so you have that to deal with. But on the house, it's every two years, the whims and wishes of the person that's setting and if they're popular at the White House, makes it almost impossible for them to- to fight back hard, or sit down and work out a really tough agreement that the President wouldn't be on board for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have been pushing to make it easier or less burdensome for energy companies to be able to drill, this permitting reform that you've been pushing.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, all types of energy. What I- what we did, Margaret, we did- we did a permitting- we were working on a permitting bill, the John Barrosso, Republican, and I worked together for over a year and a half trying to work through the nuances of trying to say, okay, you have to produce energy that this country needs to operate on our economy, and also be able to defend ourself with our military. That comes from fossil fuels. Renewables is a direction that there's- we'd like to be able to go with technology that will lets- they give us the energy with less carbon emissions. So we looked at everything, and only thing that we said, we came to this permitting bill, how can we produce the energy we need today and continue to invest and not waste money, but invest in technology we- for the energy we want for tomorrow? That's what the bill did. And with that, we had, I mean, a really great bill that came out of our committee, 15 to 4, never happened before. So you would think that it would be a slam dunk. Here we have something.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it didn't make it into that short term (INAUDIBLE).",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: And you would think that President Trump, I was hoping, and I tried everything I could to talk to him and make sure they understood: this bill will allow you to do what you want to do, produce the energy that this country needs. We're producing more energy than anybody in the world. People don't realize that. And you never heard\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Record levels. Record levels of output of oil and natural gas.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2014record levels, and you never heard- you never heard President Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris, and even when she was running for president, until a couple weeks before the election they even acknowledge it. They never did acknowledge that with the IRA, we paid down $230 billion of debt. That was part of the bill. Never talked about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think they were\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: They just couldn't, because it wasn't where they were. They were forced. I wrote the bill, energy portion, and it forced them to have a balanced energy position, and- and then they were just going balls to the wall, to the- with the EVs and everything else. And I told them it was completely wrong. They were way ahead of their skis. We were trying to bring the manufacturing and also the production and- and supply chain with critical minerals back to the United States, or with our free trade agreement countries, there will be reliable supply chains. Right now, they cut everything in half. The rules were absolutely horrible, and I've been fighting them ever since. And I think maybe the President Trump can clean that up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't see this latest proposal from you, making it into some 11th hour deal to avoid a government shutdown?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: If the President Trump would- if President Trump would actually say to Mike Johnson, I need that permitting bill. I need that permitting bill to do what I've got to do. If he thinks he wants to raise this- the debt ceiling because he doesn't want to be encumbered about how he wants to operate, I can tell you he's going to be tied in knots wanting to do that, the drill, baby drill, or basically producing more, because you just can't. You have to be able to have leasing permits, and you have to go through a rigmarole thing. And the court systems are so, so onerous, to the point to where it's almost impossible. We cut all that burden out. We basically still are very concerned about the environment, but if you're going to have a problem, tell me up front, don't wait to six years and sue me later. We did judicial reforms, a lot of things that really accelerated us being able to meet the challenges and the energy that we need in the next five years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were spotted at that Army-Navy game\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yes, I was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013-speaking to Donald Trump.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I made a point to be there. I was\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking to him about exactly this. Premitting reform.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I did. Well, he had so much going on. I had a chance just to mention this. I hope you really think about this and- and I'm sure he had so much more- x",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll watch.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: We'll watch",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will see.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: You never know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you reached out to Mr. Trump since last weekend on this?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I haven't, I haven't talked to him. They've got- I think they got a lot on their plate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: This is important though. I hope- I'm going to try.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you were speaking to us on \"Face the Nation\" last January, and we were talking about what was happening and the election cycle, and you were spending time on the campaign trail, you said, 'I love my country too much to vote for Donald Trump\u2026I think it would be very detrimental to my country.' He's the president-elect. Do you think he is detrimental to America?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Here's the thing I've said, you know, I said basically what I had known from the four years before. January 6 was a bridge too far for me and I think everyone knows that. I had a good relationship with him, you know, when he was- when he was the president, and we worked together. I was one of the few Democrats that went over and worked with him, and we always got along great, we're very friendly. We used to have disagreements on some things, but you can do that. I've said this, Margaret, I mean it all my- all my heart, when the people speak and they make their choice and the election's over, you better pray everything you have the president will be successful. And if you're in a position to help, you have knowledge of how the system works and can make it work, do it. Don't worry about well, did you vote or not vote for him? Did you- did- is that in your same party that you're in, or whatever? Forget about that. This is about our country, and I want him to succeed, and I have said this to him, I'll do whatever I can to help in any way humanly possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've talked about the need to return to bipartisanship and regular order. Donald Trump is promising to destroy regular order. Upend the system.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I- I have\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you reconcile that?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I have- I have total confidence and faith in my Republican Senate colleagues that are institutionalists that will not let that happen. They have the chance. They have the power. Here's the thing. We have three branches of government. Bob Byrd used to tell me all the time, he says, Joe, he says, the president's not my boss, he said, and the majority leader is not my boss. The people of West Virginia are my boss. That's who I work for, and for the betterment of our country, as long as you keep that, what's your purpose of being here? And I think there's enough Republican senators and Democrat senators too, but Republicans have control because they're the majority, that are not going to let the filibuster blow apart. They're not going to let basically run amok of the reconciliation process just to do anything they want to and override the parliamentarian and play some rough games. I don't think they will do that. And it only takes five, or it takes four, I'm sorry, it takes four Republican senators, just four, and I guarantee you, I think there's a lot more than four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who are going to hold the line?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That'll- that'll protect the institution. They've been here long enough. What goes around comes around, and in two years, this thing could flip. 2026, you never know. It's- it's the power of the people. People go to the polls however this thing comes out. So with that being said, they're not going to put themselves in a position. I faulted my Democrat colleagues for always, as soon as they got a chance, they wanted to get rid of the filibuster, and they know I was dead set- I'd do anything I could to stop that from happening, because I thought that was the Holy Grail of keeping democracy. That, and not allowing the reconciliation to be used every day they want to for basically policy-making. That's not what it's for. The reconciliation process was for keeping our finances in check, and we have done a horrible job on finances in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, in the first 100 days of the Trump administration, Leader John Thune has said he plans a once-in-a-generation investment in border security, but he's going to try to do it without Democratic votes, using that reconciliation process you just talked about. So with 51 votes, not the 60. You're saying right now, that this is- this is not how the system is supposed to work.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It's not supposed to on policy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet, that is what the Republican leader is saying he's going to do right out of the gate.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Hold on Margaret, if he's going to have to show the financial connotation, and the cost is- it's costing and how it's harming our country. If it's harming it in the financial burden that we're carrying because of all the illegals coming and he can tie that to it, then he'll have a pathway for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And then step two is tax reform.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Tax reform definitely finds- falls\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also through reconciliation.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah. Well, here I followed Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden, starting out in their 117th Congress with the ARP. I begged the president\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The American Rescue Plan.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: The American Rescue Plan. Not to go in reconciliation. That's basically when you've given up that you can't work with the other side. They come out of the box that way. So this is the plan that the Republicans are following now that the Democrats basically showed them the- the pathway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it a strategic mistake?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Oh, I think it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's damaging to the institution.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, it's damaging from the standpoint, if you don't think that you want, you want to do it alone, I'm going to give you a chance to prove to me you won't work with me. I'm not just going to come out the box Margaret. I know you won't work with me, so I'm going to do this. Obviously, I'd put it- put it, and I've said this to President Biden, please put it in the committee of jurisdiction wherever it falls within, whether it's Finance or whether it's",
      "Energy or wherever it may be, and then put the shot clock on us. Say, guys, you got- you got 60 days to make this happen, and if they shut you down, they'll prove to you they don't want to work with you. Then you do what you got to do, but don't come out of the box that way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, you played a big role in crafting, that was party line. That was through reconciliation.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That's how the vote came down. But I guarantee it. We did majority of all that bill. We wrote that bill in my committee, and I guarantee I had over five years of input for Republicans. But because of reconciliation, they don't cross over and vote. That's just the way it was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you feel good about that?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I feel, no I feel horrible about that. We had to do it in reconciliation. I felt horrible about that. But I can tell you, the United States of America has benefited from that. From the standpoint of more investments, more offshore coming back to the United States for manufacturing, we didn't fall into a recession. We brought down inflation from 9 to 3%, we brought down gas prices from 5 to $3. We did all of that, but the supply chains were so broken because of the pandemic, the prices of everyday staple of life, food, things of that sort made this almost unbearable for people to the burden they were carrying. The thing that the IRA kept the United States economy in better shape than any place else in the world during the pandemic. That's a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President Elect has vowed to repeal it.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I think there's some things that need to be fixed. I think there is some things that need to be fixed in it because of how and I've said, you heard me say this many times, when you pass a piece of legislation and you write the bill, and we wrote it as tight as we possibly could, and then they start basically putting the rules to it. So okay, if you're going to put out incentives and tax incentives, it goes to IRS. Well, if the White House says, I want this type of interpretation that makes it very very liberal interpretation. It's not what the bill was supposed to do. And I have told them many times with President Biden and with Mr. Podesta, these are all good people I know, friendly with very much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The energy advisor.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Energy advisor, I said you people are going down a primrose path, which is horrible. We didn't write the bill that way, in spite of themselves trying to liberalize and putting EVs out and all of the critical minerals we're still depending on China when we're supposed to be weaning ourselves off of China. He can fix that immediately. President Trump can come in here and change some of those rules to get back. He, and then change, change the bill. It'll be his- it'll be his energy bill, but\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013So reprogramming some of these funds you'd be OK with\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013Reprogramming absolutely\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are things in there tax credits for nuclear bio fuels. Do you think parts of- you think parts of this will survive?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I think it almost has to. The investments are made, and most of the investments, the majority of the investments, are made in what you would consider red states, Republican states. That's just because of what they do and how they operate, like West Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you didn't hear much about that from the Democratic ticket during the campaign\u2013",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Why?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I had no idea. I kept saying, Can't you just exact- tell what the bill did? They were saying, renewable, renewable, renewable. Only thing I said, you cannot eliminate your way to a cleaner environment, Margaret. You can't just say, I want to get rid of coal. I want to get rid of oil. I want no gas. I want nothing extracted. We're going to do everything for renewables. We'd be a third world country. You can't keep this economy running. Now, you can do it with innovation, technology. So I said we're going to produce what we need. We do it cleaner and better than anywhere in the world, producing more. So the bill did exactly on energy production. You wouldn't be number one in the world right now, 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, 4.7 billion barrels of oil. You wouldn't do that if we hadn't written that bill. He can take that and even go further with it. There are so many good things in that bill that he can change it. Change the name. It'll be his. I'll help any way I can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, just had a memo arguing unfettered U.S. gas exports will harm the U.S. economy.",

      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, we've replaced, Margaret, an awful lot of the- this the foreign Russia fuel coming into NATO ally, our country in Europe. We replaced that because of this. But the bottom line is, I don't know where we- the tipping point would be. We're going to be up to about 26 billion cubic feet a day. We're going to double where we are. 2016 we had zero. This is where- how far we come. And with that, we've been able to keep the gas prices fairly reasonable and low in America, there's still two and a half $3 in MCF, million cubic feet of gas, which is extremely, very reasonable. Other countries are paying 12, 13, 14, 15 dollars for the same amount of gas. So we have been awash in gas. I have not seen the final report, and they wanted to start curbing it and say we're going to stop LNG, remember that? A Pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the Biden administration said they were pausing for review\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013So I said, oh no, that doesn't make any sense at all. Give me the report that shows me what the reserves we have left, what the domestic demand is going to be, and if we have the reserve to help our allies.",

But I say guys- but a lot of them really understand it, they just can't speak it because the base has gone so far, and that's I just I couldn't take it anymore.",

If the people of America want to get the best quality, the best character of a human being, they want to represent them so you can continue to enjoy this great domestic, what we call this great democracy ours, which is a representative form. We're still an experimental stage. We're responsible for putting the person that's going to represent us to run this government. You've got to get the best person there.

And that's exactly if the democrat and republican party control the primaries, they can control you up here. Because basically you have a hard time winning unless they unless the leadership of both sides, Democrat and Republican, are supporting you, putting their weight and their finances behind you. So they're going to say, hey, Margaret, I'm sorry you just didn't toe the line right. You didn't vote with us when we needed you. So I'm going to find somebody else that I can control",

I know it's something, could I work with you and maybe- people have to try a different approach. I mean, I had, I had no problem talking to President Trump when he was, you know, I would just say, I'm not sure that's going to work, and maybe we could try something else. I never just say, Oh, you're wrong. You don't go, you can't start out a conversation that is going to end productive if I tell you how bad you are on the front end. If I tell you, that's a pretty good idea, Margaret, could we work on it together, make it a little better?\u00a0 I'm telling you, I can't do what you want me to do.

And on the campaign trail, Donald Trump said he wants the resignation of every single military officer who touched the Afghanistan disaster on his desk by noon on Inauguration Day. Presidents make policy, officers execute it. Do you think there should be retribution, or whatever holding to account means?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I pray to God he doesn't do that. I hope that was just campaign rhetoric. You can't do that. You can't do that, Margaret, basically\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013He says he's going to at noon.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, let's just pray to God he doesn't. You know, things change around here pretty quickly. And the thing I'm saying is this, he's going to be the commander in chief. He's going to give orders, and I guarantee the military will take the orders and take them very well. I am so impressed. And just this amazes me, the military might that we have, but also it's ingrained in them, especially if you ever go through the military academies and people come up through ROTC, and all the people that are really in tune with who we are and the purpose of serving. They're not going to go off it. They do not try to make policy decisions. They will not jump into it. But they're thinking, there are some, well, there's going to be some, you know, that sometimes speak out that maybe shouldn't, but they did, and they've targeted and this and that, and we've had a few generals that have left the ranks because of those reasons. But I can tell you, I can assure you, the military that we have, have followed the private course of what we've dictated our geopolitical course that we're taking, and they've been very good at doing that. The mistakes have been made, even though they see those mistakes. So the people that basically were following orders of the extraction in Afghanistan- first of all, I couldn't believe that we'd just up and leave. I thought we would at least keep Bagram Air Force Base and have that established base, which is an unbelievable value to us, and keeping a little bit of peace in that part of the world. Working with- you can work with the Taliban, whoever you want to over there, but the bottom line, that was a show of force that we had. We could work and help people and do a lot of good from there. We just didn't have to tell them how to live their life and what they should be doing. That's the problem. But when they get out the way they did, that left a mark on us, and it help- it hurt. It reverberated around the world. And the geopolitical unrest that we were kind of on the tinder belt box anyway, it just kind of says, oh, look what's going on. Let's go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken about your friendship with Joe Biden for many, many years. That was tested during this presidency.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When was the last time you spoke with him?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It was before the campaign. It was before the campaign, before he made his decision, before the- probably before, I'm just trying to think, probably before the debate, probably\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: before June.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: His debate, probably it's been a while.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A consequential debate at the end\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, and I mean, I just, I still think, think he's a very good person. I still like him and Jill and their family just tough. This is a tough situation, okay, but the bottom line is I still, when I spoke, I would still speak to him with respect, and I would do it in a way that I thought would be helpful. I think to be against something means, okay, what do you have better. If I was against what he was doing in energy, I thought I had something better that could help him with. If I was with something of public policy or a policy that they have taken, I'd have to have a better idea. And where I came from had to be more common sense. I had to go home and explain it. And I only think I've told everybody up here. If you want to know, I can tell you exactly. I cannot go home and explain this. And I think you know what that means. I'm not voting for it. I'm telling you up front, so don't be don't be all caught off guard and get excited when you see me get on the floor and vote for something. Oh, Manchin, killed it. No, no. You killed it because you brought it up. You knew you didn't have the votes before you brought it up, but you want to make a show, and you want me to be the bad guy. I know what you're doing, and I've been doing that for far too long, and they should never bring some of the people what they brought for confirmation, which I said, You do not have my vote. Without my vote, you can't pass them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Wall Street Journal has a report about how the White House insulated Joe Biden during his presidency, largely shielding him from the press and not giving him access to lawmakers. They cite you in the article as spending time one on one with President Biden, but in it, you're cited as noticing he lacks stamina and relied on his staff to drive the agenda more than other presidents you had worked with. Do you think that they were concealing the president's decline?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I don't know how they got that conclusion. I never had a problem sitting and talking with him, and in fact- and the matter of fact, when we start negotiating, he knew that I was against the American rescue plan the way it was coming out, going to reconciliation. And he wanted to talk to me and everything. And when I walked in after he heard that I might be opposing that he's- I said something at 10 o'clock in the morning, by two o'clock, I'm sitting in the Oval Office. And when I came in, hey Jojo, how you doing? We got to talk. So if he says, Hey Jojo, I know things are pretty good. If he's a Joe, come in here. I want to talk to you. I know it's going to be a little bit more- little bit more tense. Depends how he approaches that. Okay, so with that I walked in, you made everybody leave the room, everybody just me and him, and that's when I said, Mr. President, I'm begging you not to do this. You're coming out assuming that Republicans won't work with you, and you were the only one on the stage saying you knew how to make things happen, because you were the deal maker. I know that. I watched it. Now, all of a sudden, you're coming out of the chute, throwing a nuclear bomb. I said, Please don't I said, make them prove they don't work with- with you first. But I said, Let's gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go. I said, Well, okay, and I've always been differential to a president, same as I'm differential to any president that wants to put their staff together. They have someone as long as they're qualified and don't have any nefarious problems that we will find out in a deep dive. That's why you should have FBI reviews. No matter who they are. You need to know. Senators need to know that. I guarantee you they don't want to go into this naked. Democrats and Republicans don't want to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying it's a mistake for the Trump administration to bypass the FBI background checks.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I can guarantee you one thing, the senators will get their own FBI report. They're not going to let it go. They're not going to make a decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All of them on Armed Services, not just leadership?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN:\u00a0 I would think that everyone- I would think that everyone understands how critical that advise and consent is. That is what you've got, and that's a purpose and a reason for that. But anyway\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who do you have in mind when you say that? Who's background check do you think needs to be reviewed? Who are you concerned about?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I mean, you know Tulsi. I know Tulsi Gabbard. I like Tulsi as a person. I just don't know all the other things have happened over the years. You follow me? But I knew when she was first here in Congress, and I came here as a senator and- and we had, you know, because she was moderate, very modern, centrist, we had a lot in common back then, when we could talk about different things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Pete Hegseth.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pete, I don't know well. I don't know Pete that well. And you want to make sure he has the qualifications, and if the President thinks he does, I would, you know, I don't have a bit of problem. Once the presidents pick their team, I'll tell you the reason why. That's will and pleasure. They come and go with the President. They're not hanging over to another president who has to inherit these people. So you always when I was governor, I used to go tell the state senator you might not know the people I'm bringing on board. Do your- do your do your investigation. If you find nothing that they've not done, they're a good character, might not be somebody you know or you like, but they have the qualifications. I have faith in them. Give me a chance to work with him, if not throw us both out. That's how I look at it. So anytime a president asked me something, I said, so I finally just had to tell President Biden, I said, Are you asking me as your friend and as my president to get on the American rescue plan? And he said, Yes. I'll do it one time. That was it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go. How are you going to influence politics from outside the Senate? And do you regret not running for president yourself?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I would have loved to have had a platform that I could speak, which I think is pretty centrist common sense, where most people in America are, and maybe I could have done this. Could I have won or not? Who knows? Could I put a team together that I could show that could responsibly govern, taking consideration that you have to be fiscally responsible and you can be socially compassionate, but you can run it- run your household, and you can run your country with compassion, but also being responsible. And right now I'm saying we're throwing caution to the wind on both of those. So with that, I could have brought that to a level in a discussion that maybe bring the extremes back. You know, the extremes have never run the parties, but the extremes are running the parties now and then they're closing and shutting everything down, open the process up. I had to fight when I was secretary of state of West Virginia to have open primaries. I wanted to basically- independents couldn't vote in a Democratic primary in West Virginia when I became Secretary of State, that's because we already had all the Democrats at 75% Democrat state. They said, why do we have to do anything? We don't need those people. I said, You mean you're going to sit back and allow the Republicans open the primary up, to allow an\u00a0 independent come in, says, I'd like to vote, and they're going to say, well, you don't even vote for the Republicans because the Democrats won't allow you. I finally got to change that. But you have to open this process up. If you want a representative form of democracy to work in this experiment of 240 years, then let's do it the right way and let people participate and have some say, and have a better quality of candidate or more selection, if you will.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I heard that.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: The boat's gonna stay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What are you going to use the boat for?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I got on the boat. Everybody wants a boat, so yeah, and we're all gonna come down. I promise you that we'll do that. But here's what. Last night, we had a big dinner with D's and R's, 5 D's and five R's. And I said, guys, the only thing I can tell you is I'm leaving. I'm leaving, but I'm not going that far away, because I want you all to have a place. And we did so many good things in that boat. We got so many discussions. We got through so many problems. And I said, you know, you get four D's, four R's whatever. Only thing I'm going to tell you, the boat will be available to you, but you've got to bring a person from the other party when you come. So if you want to bring five of your D's down, or you'll be five R's, then bring five D's, and we'll take care of the rest. I'll have you down there, and we'll come down. And once I get through the gate and get on the boat, nobody can bother. Nobody hears them, nobody you never heard any conversations or any bills came out of that boat. But a lot did, and we had a lot of good friendships came out that boat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think that's going to be possible in this environment?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I'm trying. I'm trying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That it's not too toxic for Democrats to work with Donald Trump?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It's never too toxic for people to get together and enjoy a little vibration, vibration and vibration. (laughing) Enjoy, enjoy getting together. And I tell you this on the boat, the most beautiful thing we do, no matter what we do that night, we have, we have some- some- some refreshments. We have some food. But before we leave, we always put Lee Greenwood on, \"Proud to be an American,\" and we all stand up and hug each other, I can tell you that. So if I can keep that alive, I've done something.",

      "REP. FRENCH HILL: Good morning, Margaret. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a Merry Christmas as well to you. This was quite the journey to get you back home and to get lawmakers to wrap up business this past week. No Democrat voted against this measure to keep the government open, but 34 Republicans did. Doesn't this show that Republicans really struggle to govern when they pass things along party lines. Won't they need to work with Democrats in this new Congress?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I think it's very, very important that Speaker Johnson and incoming Majority Leader Thune have a steady plan together to work with the incoming Trump administration to prioritize the President's priorities, our priorities in the House and Senate, make sure we're on the same page. Because with narrow majorities, we've got to work together, and that's critical. And I think this last week demonstrated that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have a fractured conference, a slim majority. Marc Short, who was the Director of Legislative Affairs in the first Trump administration, said this chaos shows just how hard it will be to tackle border and tax policies in 2025. What's the reality check on the timing of that and actually delivering on what Trump campaigned on?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I think Speaker Johnson and again, Majority Leader Thune, working with President Trump, want to use the budget reconciliation process that's still -still being discussed as to exactly what that procedure will be. But I believe actually that Republicans on both sides of the Hill are united that we want to unleash American energy for future production and an all of the above energy strategy. We want to secure the border. We want to fight inflation through supply side regulatory reforms. We want to roll back those regulations that are constraining the markets and constraining private business, having access to capital. So, I think we're on the same page, and I think budget reconciliation will be a way to start that process and also rein in unsustainable $2 trillion deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you can do a party line vote in the Senate there with the Republicans, but can you really get 218 Republicans to vote in the same direction when it was such a struggle just with keeping the lights on?",
      "REP. HILL: I think we can. I think we demonstrated that year when we last year in the last Congress, when we put together the most comprehensive Republican only voting for border security, for an all the above energy strategy. Those are two priorities that President Trump campaigned on, we are united on those strategies, and I think we can get those priorities across the House floor as well as I say, rolling back unneeded regulatory burden on the American economy and small businesses to help fight inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things that was stripped out of that initial bipartisan deal that Speaker Johnson had put together was a restriction on US investments in China. It would have affirmed presidential authority to impose sanctions on advanced technologies. Your Democrat colleague Rosa DeLauro insinuated publicly that Elon Musk came out against this because his real motivation was his extensive business ties to China. Do you share her concerns, and will this get passed?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, look, President Biden had an executive order governing outbound investment. We've had a debate in Congress between the House and Senate on the best way to do that. We all want to limit American investment in dangerous, I would say, dual-use technologies that can be turned around and hurt the America's- America's national security, but striking that balance has been difficult, but I don't believe that was at the heart of the 1,500-page problem. I think people, a majority of members, clearly wanted a simple, straightforward continuing resolution, and not of what was turned into a large omnibus spending bill on top of a CR. So, I think President- I mean, Speaker Johnson, did a good job coming back around from that focusing on disaster assistance to the hurricane hurt states in the southeast, farm assistance for those farmers, and having a clean CR with an agreement with President Trump, with majority leader Thune, on how we would tackle reconciliation, to cut spending next Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are going to be the incoming chair of the House Financial Services Committee in the new Congress. It's one of 17 committees. Patrick McHenry, the outgoing Chair of House Financial Services was asked whether it matters that the Republican Party chose only male leaders. Take a listen.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "REP. PATRICK MCHENRY: For us to have no women chairs of committees is a huge mistake and really an unfortunate thing, because we have powerful, smart, capable, tenacious Republican women, that are capable of leading big committees and doing major things.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't the Republican Party select any female leaders?",
      "REP. HILL: Well that's a decision made by our steering committee, but I'm delighted in the House Financial Services Committee that we have strong, very passionate, successful Republican women like Ann Wagner of Missouri, Young Kim of California, Monica de la Cruz of Texas, and we're very excited to have Lisa McClain from Michigan our conference- our conference Chairwoman, and also Maria Salazar from South Florida, joining our committee. They will be active leaders in financial services policy making.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly. I know you've been trying to restrict captagon, this amphetamine drug that the Assad regime was selling to prop up the dictatorship. Our teams in Syria filmed factories full of this stuff. What's going to happen now?",
      "FRENCH HILL: Well, we need the United States to be very active work with partners to support a free and democratic Syria. Secondly, we need to document the war crimes committed by the Assad regime, as it relates to all the people murdered, killed in prison, tortured in the- from the regime, and also track down the networks that were producing captagon. We will have support from the kingdom in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states to do that, but it needs to be stopped. But I'm proud of the work we did to interdict captagon and cut off the funding, because I think it absolutely contributed to the end of the Assad regime, and that's something to celebrate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be tracking what happens with that. Before I let you go, I do want to ask you as well. A source familiar with the investigation tells CBS News that tomorrow, the House Ethics Committee's work investigating former congressman Matt Gaetz alleged sexual misconduct and drug use will be released. last month on this program, you said 'it's up to that committee, but we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.' Do you still object?",
      "FRENCH HILL: That's not- well I don't know that's how I would characterize what I said. I said it's up to that committee. I think they are- they have released documents before, but I think that's something they should do with a great deal of caution, because you open up a Pandora's box of a lot of other investigations over many, many years conducted by that committee. But if they've thought it through, reviewed the material and made that decision, that's their decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Congressman French Hill, thank you and have a Merry Christmas. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face the Nation. We are just three days away from Christmas and the start of Hanukkah. Congress has gone home, but is last week's chaos on Capitol Hill an omen of what is ahead in 2025? Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales is here in studio to answer that. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. TONY GONZALES: Good morning, Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we just saw turmoil within the party over the past few days after President elect Trump and Elon Musk scuttled this bipartisan deal, then demanded another deal that couldn't get enough Republican support to get over the finish line. Then we have this emergency stopgap measure that only takes us through mid March. You were one of 34 Republicans to vote against it. Why?",
      "REP. GONZALES: It's pretty simple, my- my constituents were against the CR just as much as I was against the CR. This- it's been a tough week, though. It started with a tragic shooting in Madison, Wisconsin. I've worked in a very bipartisan manner to make sure we have a national strategy that prevents against some of the school shootings that are occurring. I've been working with others to get that done. I think that's important. And then in the house, of course, we have this messy bill that was put on the floor. It started with a 1500 page bill. In my eyes, there's no doubt that there's a sickness in DC, and that sickness isn't going to be cured with these big, long, pork-filled bills. You do got to give President Trump a lot of credit, though he was able to whittle that down to 116 pages. Once again, the reason I voted no is I think CRs are terrible. They do nothing but kick the can down the road. Let's fast forward to March. Do you think we're going to be any closer to coming up with a spending deal then than we are now? I don't think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But if the government had shut down, the Border Patrol agents who live in your district wouldn't have received paychecks.",
      "REP. GONZALES: Right, that's why we should have done our job, instead of just saying, 'Hey, give us three more months, and I promise you, in three months, we're going to do our job.' We've ran that play before\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Yeah.",
      "REP. GONZALES: In my eyes, you use Christmas, you use New Year's. You lock everybody in a room and you say, 'let's get it done now.' There's also a bigger danger to this too, is if we're not funding the government long term, now all of a sudden you're telling the government you have to spend a year's worth of money in six months or three months. That's not fair to any of these agencies as well. So basically, it was- it was a vote on my end to say, 'let's do our job.'",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right which the Republicans who are in leadership had failed to get some of those, those bills done. In fact, Speaker Johnson chose to go this route with the CR, but I want to ask you about the dynamic here, because it's confusing, frankly. I mean, Elon Musk is tweeting against bipartisan deals negotiated and led by the Speaker of the House. At- what role exactly is he playing here?",
      "REP. GONZALES: It's kind of interesting. We have a president, we have a vice president, we have a speaker. It feels like as if Elon Musk is our prime minister. And I spoke with Elon a couple of times this week. I think many of us\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -unelected.",
      "REP. GONZALES: Unelected, But I mean, he has a voice, and I think a lot of the large part of that voice is a reflection of the voice of the people. Once again, these- a 1500 page bill, how does that pass the smell test? It's absolutely wrong. It's what's wrong with this place. So we have to get back to regular order. The other part of it too is, while House Republicans were fighting over the spending bill, guess what Senate Democrats were doing? They were- they were ensuring that President Biden got his 235th liberal judge over the finish line. That's why it's so important that House Republicans stay united, stay laser-focused on delivering on a President Trump agenda next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Republicans in the House are clearly not united, and it was Speaker Johnson who led that bipartisan deal. Do you support him if- he's standing for reelection should he still lead the party if you're saying he was leaning in the wrong direction with a 15 page, initial, funding deal?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Yeah, and I do, I do support Speaker Johnson, I think he's done a fantastic job keeping us all together. It's like feral cats in the house, right? So that's a tough job to begin with, but the fact that he was able to work with President Trump in order to whittle it down to a little over 100 pages, the fact that he was able to work with the, you know, with Elon Musk and some of these other folks, other members, to find a solution, just goes to prove that he's found a way. But they're also- this can't be the norm. This cannot be the norm. Once again, that's the reason why I voted against the CR is, this cannot be the norm, that we have to get back to regular order and pass our appropriations bills. Homeland Security is certainly important to us. There's other things that are going on in the world",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So because the Republican majority now is so thin, it will also be thin in the new Congress. But right now, any missed vote gets a lot of attention. Congresswoman Kay Granger hasn't cast a vote since July, and there was a local reporter in Dallas who looked into this and found the 81 year old has been living in a local memory care and assisted living facility for some time. That was not shared with the public. Were you and others in the Texas delegation aware?",
      "REP. GONZALES: I wasn't aware. I think there's no doubt a lot of us knew that she was gaining an age, like a lot of members do. And sadly, you know, some of these members wait until it's too long to things have gone too far\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013And leadership allowed for it?",
      "REP. GONZALES: I think it's- maybe, I'm not too sure what leadership knew on it or didn't know on it. I'd say on the other side of the aisle is the same thing. I mean, we saw what happened on the Senate side, you know, with Senator Feinstein and some of these others that have missed votes for a long time. I think this goes- gets back to the root of it. Congress should do its job, and if you can't do your job, maybe you shouldn't be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, she wasn't there, and apparently it went either unnoticed or just not acknowledged to the public, which certainly raises eyebrows. I need to get to the border, because that is what 800 miles of the border\u2013",
      "REP. GONZALES: -that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In your district. Border patrol had fewer than 50,000 apprehensions at the southern border last month. That's a Biden era low. Does that mean coming into office that essentially, the crisis has been fixed before Donald Trump even arrives, and that it's not as big of a project as initially thought?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Oh no, it's a huge project. And while the Biden administration has has started to do some things right. The Trump administration is going to do everything right in this manner. And I'll tell you why, this is why it's important. Earlier this week, I had a classified briefing on the threat, the worldwide threats to homeland, to our homeland. I won't share some of the sensitive stuff, but I'll share some of the open source stuff. In Syria, a lot of us are rooting for a free Syria. Free Syria, it brings a lot of opportunities for- for stability in that region, but it also brings a national security threat. Assad was a bad guy, he imprisoned a lot of folks, sometimes wrongfully. Some of those folks are terrorists. Now they are loose. Where are they? Where are they going? Let's bring it back to the southern border. This year, the Biden administration has apprehended 600 Syrians. Does that mean all those Syrians are terrorists? Of course not. But do we know who these people are, and who- are they coming to our country? This is something that President Trump is going to get to the bottom of.",

      "An orca who made headlines in 2018 after she carried her dead calf on her head for more than two weeks and a distance of 1,000 miles has given birth again, according to the Center for Whale Research.",
      "The killer whale calf was spotted in the Puget Sound area off Washington state several days ago. On Tuesday, the center determined J35, also known as Tahlequah, was the baby's mother. The calf, a girl, was given the designation J61.",
      "It's not all good news for the mom and baby though.",
      "\"The team, including multiple experienced killer whale researchers, have expressed concern about the calf's health based on the behavior of both J35 and J61,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Early life is always dangerous for new calves, with a very high mortality rate in the first year. J35 is an experienced mother, and we hope that she is able to keep J61 alive through these difficult early days.\"",
      "The organization, which tracks southern resident orca populations in the Pacific Northwest, did not specify what sparked the concern. Seattle-based Orca Conservancy wrote on social media that researchers believe the calf was born prematurely. Orca Conservancy said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been able to spend time on the water with the calf and they observed the baby \"remaining underwater for extended amounts of time indicating nursing or attempts to nurse.\"",
      "\"The calf had also been observed being pushed around on J35's head and was not looking lively, which is a concern, but also added calf behavior is not fully understood,\" Orca Conservancy wrote.",
      "Tahlequah also\u00a0gave birth to a calf in 2020. Experts at the time described it as big news, because up to 70% of orca pregnancies end with a either a miscarriage or a calf that dies shortly after birth.",
      "Southern resident killer whales, like Tahlequah, are the only endangered population of killer whales in the U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The summer population census for 2020 counted only 72 southern resident killer whales, though several calves have been born since the census. Though a recovery plan was completed in 2008, the population continues to struggle and has declined over 10% since 2005.",
      "\"The Southern Resident killer whale population needs ample access to their food supply, mainly salmon, to survive and thrive,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Every single birth counts and these whales need enough fish to be able to support themselves and their calves. We continue to advocate for salmon recovery through habitat restoration, removal of dams, and rational management of fisheries in the Pacific Northwest.\"",

      "Spanish archaeologists have successfully removed a 2,600-year-old shipwreck from waters off the country's southeastern coast, two decades after the relic was initially found, officials said.",
      "The ancient Phoenician shipwreck dates back to the 7th century B.C.E. It was discovered in 1994 off the coast of Murcia in southeastern Spain, near the town of Mazarr\u00f3n,\u00a0according to Spain's Ministry of Culture.",
      "Now called the Mazarr\u00f3n II, this shipwreck was one of two located in that same general area. The first, called Mazarr\u00f3n I, was initially located in 1993, lifted from the water in June 1995, and put on display at Spain's National Museum of Underwater Archaeology in 2005 after undergoing years of conservation treatments, the museum said.",
      "Mazarr\u00f3n II is of particular interest to archaeologists and researchers because it is one of only a few Phoenician-era shipwrecks discovered largely intact, said Carlos de Juan, the director of the excavation project, in a video shared by the University of Valencia. The university partnered with the regional culture ministry in Murcia to carry out the excavation.",
      "A team of 14 specialists worked with de Juan to lift the shipwreck from the sea in less than two months, beginning the project Sept. 13 and finishing Nov. 7. Video shows divers carrying wooden fragments of the wreck to the surface in pieces.",
      "Phoenicia was an ancient civilization along the eastern Mediterranean coast, in the area of modern-day Lebanon, Syria and Israel, which existed from about 1500 to 300 B.C.E. Although historians say Phoenicians thrived for a time on trade and developed an alphabet that formed the basis for the ones later produced by ancient Greece and Rome, many traces of the civilization were considered lost until the 20th century.",
      "Artifacts like Mazarr\u00f3n II can help shed light on Phoenician culture, said de Juan. He noted in his comments to the University of Valencia that little is known about Phoenician naval construction, even now, despite the wealth of information about ships built nearby in the Mediterranean by the ancient Greeks.",
      "\"Therefore, this wreck is a very important contribution to this area of study,\" de Juan said. He noted that elements of the Mazarr\u00f3n II are similar to construction designs seen in cultures throughout the surrounding region, but some are distinctive and mysterious, at least for now.",

    "summary": "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, and is marked with traditions and celebrations around the world.",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, in the Northern Hemisphere. The celestial event signifies the first day of winter, astronomically.",
      "What is the winter solstice?",
      "The winter solstice is the day each year that has the shortest period of daylight between sunrise and sunset, and therefore the longest night. It happens when the sun is directly above the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude that circles the globe south of the equator, the National Weather Service explains.",
      "The farther north you are, the shorter the day will be, and in the Arctic Circle, the sun won't rise at all.",
      "How is the day of the winter solstice determined?",
      "The winter solstice occurs because of the Earth's tilt as it rotates around the sun.",
      "When the Northern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun, the nights last longer. The longest night happens on the solstice because the hemisphere is in its furthest position from the sun. That occurs each year on Dec. 21 or 22.",
      "This year, it falls on Dec. 21 at 4:21 a.m ET, to be precise.",
      "On the summer solstice, when the northern tilt is closest to the sun, we have the longest day, usually June 20 or 21.",
      "The solstices are not always exactly on the 21st every year because the earth's rotation around the sun is 365.25 days, instead of 365 even.",
      "Will days start getting longer after the winter solstice?",
      "Yes. Each day after the solstice, we get one minute more of sunlight. It doesn't sound like much, but after just two months, or around 60 days, we'll be seeing about an hour more of sunlight.",
      "When will winter officially be over in 2025?",
      "The meteorological winter ends on March 20, 2025. Then, spring will last until June 20, when the summer solstice arrives.",
      "How is the winter solstice celebrated around the world?",
      "Nations and cultures around the world have celebrated the solstice since ancient times with varying rituals and traditions. The influence of those solstice traditions can still be seen in our celebrations of holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Britannica notes.",
      "The ancient Roman Saturnalia festival celebrated the end of the planting season and has close ties with modern-day Christmas. It honored Saturn, the god of harvest and farming. The multiple-day affair had lots of food, games and celebrations. Presents were given to children and the poor, and slaves were allowed to stop working.",
      "Gatherings are held every year at Stonehenge, a monumental circle of massive stones in England that dates back about 5,000 years. The origins of Stonehenge are shrouded in mystery, but it was built to align with the sun on solstice days.",
      "The Hopi, a Native American tribe in the northern Arizona area, celebrate the winter solstice with dancing, purification and sometimes gift-giving. A sacred ritual known as the Soyal Ceremony marks the annual milestone.",
      "In Peru, people honor the return of the sun god on the winter solstice. The ancient tradition would be to hold sacrificial ceremonies, but today, people hold mock sacrifices to celebrate. Because Peru is in the Southern Hemisphere, their winter solstice happens in June, when the Northern Hemisphere is marking its summer solstice.",
      "Scandinavia celebrates St. Lucia's Day, a festival of lights.",
      "The \"arrival of winter,\" or Dong Zhi, is a Chinese festival where family gathers to celebrate the year so far. Traditional foods include tang yuan, sweet rice balls with a black sesame filling. It's believed to have its origins in post-harvest celebrations.",
      "Researchers stationed in in Antarctica even have their own traditions, which may include an icy plunge into the polar waters. They celebrate \"midwinter\" with festive meals, movies and sometimes homemade gifts.",

      "Humans aren't alone when it comes to yawning\u00a0\u2014 all vertebrates do it too, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. But why?",
      "The \"evolutionarily ancient\" act of yawning likely serves a few purposes, according to Andrew Gallup, a professor of behavioral biology at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "\"The fact that it is conserved so widely across the animal kingdom suggests that it likely holds an evolutionary function, and research suggests that it functions in a variety of domains,\" he said on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0Friday.",
      "Those findings suggest yawning may have a role in promoting changes in our state of alertness or activity patterns.",
      "\"We often yawn frequently before we go to sleep or after we wake up,\" Gallup said. \"Yawns have been shown to increase arousal and alertness as associated with these state changes.\"",
      "Research also suggests yawning has a brain-cooling function.",
      "\"One of the mechanisms that could facilitate changes in state or heightened arousal as a result of yawning is brain cooling,\" Gallup said.",
      "Brain cooling refers to cooling the temperature of the brain, he said, and this can help us feel calmer, \"because stress and anxiety increase brain temperature and also trigger yawning.\"",
      "Gallup also said he isn't insulted when someone yawns, because it's both contagious and a common, natural mechanism.",
      "\"It helps promote mental awareness and alertness. So when individuals yawn in an academic setting or a boardroom, it could be an indicator that they're actually trying to pay attention,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 09:18:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Early Americans may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts, research shows.",
    "story": [
      "Sloths weren't always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge - up to 4 tons - and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier - perhaps far earlier - than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\"There was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly - what's called 'Pleistocene overkill,'\" said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \"humans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms - a bit like the plates of modern armadillos - that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there's a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\"We believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\" she said. Three similar \"pendant\" fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table - those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old - more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco's research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \"fresh bones\" shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas - and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\"There's still a big debate,\" Pacheco said.",
      "\"Really compelling evidence\"",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \"What I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\" she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America - giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time - with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% - many researchers surmised that humans' arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\"It was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\" said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program. \"But it doesn't really work so well anymore.\"",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods - including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques - coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\"Anything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\" said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \"But really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\"",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\"We found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\" in \"fresh bones\" - meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites - whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn't clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "\"A giant ground sloth\"",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\"Monte Verde was a shock. You're here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \"cut marks\" on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it's hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\"They've made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\" said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \"Why would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \"We didn't set out to find the oldest anything - we've really just followed the evidence where it leads,\" he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans' arrival in the Americas remains contested - and may never be known - it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn't immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \"a giant ground sloth going along on four feet\" when it encounters the footprints of a small human who's recently dashed by. The huge animal \"stops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

      "Preparing cancer patients for difficult decisions is an oncologist's job. They don't always remember to do it, however. At the University of Pennsylvania Health System, doctors are nudged to talk about a patient's treatment and end-of-life preferences by an artificially intelligent algorithm that predicts the chances of death.",
      "But it's far from being a set-it-and-forget-it tool. A routine tech checkup revealed the algorithm decayed during the covid-19 pandemic, getting 7 percentage points worse at predicting who would die, according to a 2022 study.",
      "There were likely real-life impacts. Ravi Parikh, an Emory University oncologist who was the study's lead author, told KFF Health News the tool failed hundreds of times to prompt doctors to initiate that important discussion \u2014 possibly heading off unnecessary chemotherapy \u2014 with patients who needed it.",
      "He believes several algorithms designed to enhance medical care weakened during the pandemic, not just the one at Penn Medicine. \"Many institutions are not routinely monitoring the performance\" of their products, Parikh said.",
      "Algorithm glitches are one facet of a dilemma that computer scientists and doctors have long acknowledged but that is starting to puzzle hospital executives and researchers: Artificial intelligence systems require consistent monitoring and staffing to put in place and to keep them working well.",
      "In essence: You need people, and more machines, to make sure the new tools don't mess up.",
      "\"Everybody thinks that AI will help us with our access and capacity and improve care and so on,\" said Nigam Shah, chief data scientist at Stanford Health Care. \"All of that is nice and good, but if it increases the cost of care by 20%, is that viable?\"",
      "Government officials worry hospitals lack the resources to put these technologies through their paces. \"I have looked far and wide,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said at a recent agency panel on AI. \"I do not believe there's a single health system, in the United States, that's capable of validating an AI algorithm that's put into place in a clinical care system.\"",
      "AI is already widespread in health care. Algorithms are used to predict patients' risk of death or deterioration, to suggest diagnoses or triage patients, to record and summarize visits to save doctors work and to approve insurance claims.",
      "If tech evangelists are right, the technology will become ubiquitous \u2014 and profitable. The investment firm Bessemer Venture Partners has identified some 20 health-focused AI startups on track to make $10 million in revenue each in a year. The FDA has approved nearly a thousand artificially intelligent products.",
      "Evaluating whether these products work is challenging. Evaluating whether they continue to work \u2014 or have developed the software equivalent of a blown gasket or leaky engine \u2014 is even trickier.",
      "Take a recent study at Yale Medicine evaluating six \"early warning systems,\" which alert clinicians when patients are likely to deteriorate rapidly. A supercomputer ran the data for several days, said Dana Edelson, a doctor at the University of Chicago and co-founder of a company that provided one algorithm for the study. The process was fruitful, showing huge differences in performance among the six products.",
      "It's not easy for hospitals and providers to select the best algorithms for their needs. The average doctor doesn't have a supercomputer sitting around, and there is no Consumer Reports for AI.",
      "\"We have no standards,\" said Jesse Ehrenfeld, immediate past president of the American Medical Association. \"There is nothing I can point you to today that is a standard around how you evaluate, monitor, look at the performance of a model of an algorithm, AI-enabled or not, when it's deployed.\"",
      "Perhaps the most common AI product in doctors' offices is called ambient documentation, a tech-enabled assistant that listens to and summarizes patient visits. So far this year, investors at Rock Health have tracked $353 million flowing into these documentation companies. But, Ehrenfeld said, \"There is no standard right now for comparing the output of these tools.\"",
      "And that's a problem, when even small errors can be devastating. A team at Stanford University tried using large language models \u2014 the technology underlying popular AI tools like ChatGPT \u2014 to summarize patients' medical history. They compared the results with what a physician would write.",
      "\"Even in the best case, the models had a 35% error rate,\" said Stanford's Shah. In medicine, \"when you're writing a summary and you forget one word, like 'fever' \u2014 I mean, that's a problem, right?\"",
      "Sometimes the reasons algorithms fail are fairly logical. For example, changes to underlying data can erode their effectiveness, like when hospitals switch lab providers.",
      "Sometimes, however, the pitfalls yawn open for no apparent reason.",
      "Sandy Aronson, a tech executive at Mass General Brigham's personalized medicine program in Boston, said that when his team tested one application meant to help genetic counselors locate relevant literature about DNA variants, the product suffered \"nondeterminism\" \u2014 that is, when asked the same question multiple times in a short period, it gave different results.",
      "Aronson is excited about the potential for large language models to summarize knowledge for overburdened genetic counselors, but \"the technology needs to improve.\"",
      "If metrics and standards are sparse and errors can crop up for strange reasons, what are institutions to do? Invest lots of resources. At Stanford, Shah said, it took eight to 10 months and 115 man-hours just to audit two models for fairness and reliability.",
      "Experts interviewed by KFF Health News floated the idea of artificial intelligence monitoring artificial intelligence, with some (human) data whiz monitoring both. All acknowledged that would require organizations to spend even more money \u2014 a tough ask given the realities of hospital budgets and the limited supply of AI tech specialists.",
      "\"It's great to have a vision where we're melting icebergs in order to have a model monitoring their model,\" Shah said. \"But is that really what I wanted? How many more people are we going to need?\"",

      "Dating back a month now, you've either seen them in the sky, or you've seen them on the news: Drones seem to be everywhere. By all accounts, alleged drone sightings are multiplying exponentially, with more than 5,000 reported in just the past few weeks alone.",
      "But of those 5,000, only a hundred or so have generated actual law enforcement leads.",
      "George Mason University engineering professor Missy Cummings, who has been doing drone research for 25 years, says what most people are actually seeing are likely aircraft, stars, or reflections off of objects, like towers. \"Of all of those options, drone is the least likely, because it's actually pretty hard to pick these out of the sky,\" she said.",

      "In other words, no imminent threat.\u00a0 As a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the FAA, and the FBI, put it on Tuesday, \"[We] do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk.\"",

    "summary": "Toy stores and the toy industry are warning that Trump's pledge to add tariffs to Chinese imports could harm their businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is pledging to slap new tariffs on imports after he's inaugurated next month \u2014 a vow that's prompting the toy industry to warn about the impact.",
      "Even if toys are designed in Europe or the U.S., they are frequently manufactured in China, a nation whose exports Trump last month threatened to target with a new 10% tariff as soon as he takes office. On the campaign trail, he floated the idea of a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods. Nearly 80% of U.S. toys are manufactured in China, according to The Toy Association, an industry group.",
      "If Trump carries through with his tariff plan, toy prices would rise \"probably instantly,\" Jennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City's West Side Kids told CBS News. She estimates that about 90% of the toys she sells are made in China.",
      "To be sure, the toy industry isn't alone in fretting about the impact of Trump's promised tariffs, as higher prices on a broad range of imports would likely be passed onto consumers. After more than four decades serving the neighborhood, Bergman fears that higher prices may threaten her shop's survival and impact her customers.",
      "\"It would be heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me. I can't really imagine not being here.\"",
      "If Trump follows through on his tariff plans, American consumers stand to lose as much as $78 billion in spending power annually on products, including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released last month.",
      "The toy industry is also sounding the alarm, with the Toy Association calling the potential tariffs \"significantly harmful\" and urging its members to contact their Congressional delegates to express their concern.",
      "Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports, but rather than being paid by the exporting country or company, the levy is paid by the importer \u2014 and much of that is handed off to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"A tariff of 60% on China would be a major shock to international goods markets,\" experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a Dec. 12 blog post.",
      "The toy industry would be one of the U.S. industries facing the worst impacts because China is the dominant supplier to the U.S., they added.",
      "\"While toys seem like products for which substitute sellers would be readily available, China maintains a dominant position in toy production for several reasons, including its not-easily-reproduced capacity to produce materials that meet US product safety standards,\" they noted.",
      "Still, some economists say Trump could use the threat of tariffs as a bargaining tool, without actually implementing the import duties. And tariffs could also encourage more U.S. manufacturing of toys and other products, although that would likely take time for new factories to ramp up.",

      "Routh owned 17 cellphones and numerous other electronic devices, and there are hundreds of hours of police body camera and surveillance videos that have been provided to the defense, Routh's attorneys argued during a hearing two weeks ago in Fort Pierce, Florida.",
      "In her order, Cannon said she wanted to err on the side of providing more time given the seriousness of the allegations, but that starting the trial no earlier than December would be an excessive amount. A September trial date didn't amount to an \"unreasonable delay,\" she said.",
      "The judge said that any insanity defense or any request related to Routh's mental competency must be made by early February. Any visit to the scene of the assassination attempt must be made by the end of February.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024 at his West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions.",

J35 is an experienced mother, and we hope that she is able to keep J61 alive through these difficult early days.\"",

Orca Conservancy said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been able to spend time on the water with the calf and they observed the baby \"remaining underwater for extended amounts of time indicating nursing or attempts to nurse.\"",

      "Concerns about on-time delivery are so common that people share holiday deadlines for each shipping service. And in the event that you can't meet these deadlines, there are now handy etiquette guides offering advice for how to inform the recipient.",
      "If you've sent late gifts thanks to shipping delays, depleted stocks or even good old-fashioned procrastination, our new research may offer some welcome news.",
      "In a series of studies that will soon be published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology, we found that people overestimate the negative consequences of sending a late gift.",
      "Trying to follow norms",
      "Why do people tend to overestimate these consequences? Our findings indicate that when people give presents, they pay more attention to norms about gifting than the recipients do.",
      "For example, other researchers have found that people tend to be reluctant to give used products as presents because there's a norm that gifts should be new. In reality, though, many people are often open to receiving used stuff.",
      "We found that this mismatch also applies to beliefs about the importance of timing. Many people worry that a late gift will signal that they don't care about the recipient. They then fear their relationship will suffer.",
      "In reality, though, these fears are largely unfounded. Gift recipients are much less worried about when the gift arrives.",
      "Unfortunately, aside from causing unnecessary worry, being overly sensitive about giving a late present can also influence the gift you choose to buy.",
      "Compensating for lateness",
      "To test how lateness concerns affect gift choice, we conducted an online study before Mother's Day in 2021. We had 201 adults participate in a raffle. They could choose to send their mother either a cheaper gift basket that would arrive in time for the occasion or a more expensive one that would arrive late.",
      "Concerns about lateness led nearly 70% of the participants to choose the less expensive and more prompt option.",
      "In another study, we conducted the same kind of raffle for Father's Day and got similar results.",
      "Aside from finding that people will choose inferior items to ensure speedier delivery, we also found that givers may feel that they can compensate for lateness with effort.",
      "In another online study of 805 adults, we discovered that participants were less likely to expect a late delivery to damage a relationship if they signaled their care for the recipient in a different way. For example, they believed that putting an item together by hand, versus purchasing it preassembled, could compensate for a present being belated.",
      "Better late than never?",
      "If sending something late isn't as bad as expected, you may wonder whether it's OK to simply not send anything at all.",
      "We'd caution against going that route.",
      "In another online study of 903 participants, we found that recipients believed that not receiving anything at all was more likely to harm a relationship than receiving something as much as two months late.",
      "That is, late is better than never as far as those receiving gifts are concerned.",
      "You may want to keep that in mind, even if that new gaming console, action figure or virtual reality headset is sold out this holiday season. It could still be a welcome surprise if it arrives in January or February.",

    "summary": "President Biden signed legislation Christmas Eve to make the bald eagle officially the U.S. national bird.",
    "story": [
      "The bald eagle is emblematic of America. It's on coins and bills, graces the Great Seal and inspired conservation efforts that brought the species back from the brink of extinction. Though it was first used as the national symbol more than 240 years ago, Congress had never made it official.",
      "That changed earlier this year. And on Christmas Eve,\u00a0President Biden signed\u00a0the legislation declaring the bald eagle the official national bird.",
      "\"For nearly 250 years, we called the bald eagle the national bird when it wasn't,\" said Jack Davis, co-chair of the National Bird Initiative for the National Eagle Center, in a release. \"But now the title is official, and no bird is more deserving.\"",
      "It's been a long road for Haliaeetus leucocephalus, the bald eagle's scientific name, known for its striking white head and yellow beak atop its brown body. Native to the U.S., populations of the bird \u2014 which eats fish and carrion, but was also known to prey on livestock, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service \u2014 first declined due to habitat and prey loss.",
      "But it was the introduction of the pesticide DDT that contributed to the birds' near-disappearance in the 20th century. When the birds ate fish that had been exposed to the chemical, they laid eggs with weak shells. Those eggs didn't survive incubation, and populations declined to a mere 417 nesting pairs by 1963, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "The U.S. banned DDT in 1972 and, a few years later, declared bald eagles endangered. Over the next few decades, the bald eagle\u00a0populations recovered. By 2007, there were nearly 10,000 nesting pairs in the U.S. and bald eagles were removed from the endangered species list.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service puts the number of bald eagles in recent years in the hundreds of thousands. In recent years, bald eagles have charmed\u00a0birdwatchers in the heart of New York City, and eagle cams have popped up at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., at U.S. Steel in Pennsylvania and in California's Big Bear Valley.",
      "The legislation\u00a0designating the bald eagle as the U.S. national bird was spearheaded by Minnesota legislators. The state is home to what Sen. Amy Klobuchar described as one of the nation's largest bald eagle populations.",

      "Jeffries, 80, is free on $10 million bond after pleading not guilty in October to federal sex trafficking and interstate prostitution charges. The former CEO was arrested\u00a0that same month on charges of sex trafficking and engaging in interstate prostitution, with prosecutors claiming Jeffries leveraged his position as CEO to lure young men into sex by suggesting they could model for the fashion company,",
      "The lawyers wrote that the neuropsychologist concluded that cognitive impairments, including impaired memory, diminished attention, processing speed slowness, and ease of confusion means Jeffries would not be capable of assisting his attorneys.",
      "In a joint letter to the judge, defense lawyers and prosecutors suggested that experts who have evaluated Jeffries testify at a two-day competency hearing in June so that a ruling on competency can follow. A spokesperson for prosecutors said Tuesday that the office would have no further comment.",
      "Jeffries arrest came after a 2023 lawsuit filed by an actor that alleged the former CEO ran a sex trafficking operation that targeted aspiring male models. In the current case, prosecutors say Jeffries, his romantic partner and a third man lured men into drug-fueled sex parties in the Hamptons, on Long Island, by dangling the promise of modeling for the retailer's ads.",
      "Jeffries left Abercrombie in 2014 after more than two decades leading the clothing retailer once famous for its preppy, all-American aesthetic and marketing with shirtless male models.",
      "In an indictment unveiled in October, prosecutors alleged that 15 accusers were induced by \"force, fraud and coercion\" to engage in sex parties from 2008 to 2015 in New York City and the Hamptons, the wealthy summertime resort on Long Island where Jeffries has a home, as well as at hotels in England, France, Italy, Morocco and St. Barts.",

      "This year, the first night of the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah will fall on the same day as Christmas for the first time since 2005.",

      "Hanukkah's start date on the Gregorian calendar varies year by year because the Jewish calendar is based on luni-solar calendar cycles. According to Chabad, months under the Hebrew calendar follow a lunar cycle, lasting about 354 days. To keep from falling behind the approximately 365-day solar calendar, there's a 13th month on the Jewish calendar every few years to make a \"leap year.\"",
      "Another difference is that on the Jewish calendar, holidays begin at sundown and continue through the next day, so Hanukkah, which lasts eight days, will get its start this year hours after the start of Christmas.",
      "The holiday, also known as the \"Festival of Lights,\" celebrates the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the 2nd century B.C. after the Jews overcame the rule of the Greeks. While rededicating the Temple, they found a small amount of ritually pure oil, enough for just one day, and used it to light the menorah, a multibranched candelabrum. That oil miraculously lasted eight days.",

The holidays started on the same day in 1910, 1921, 1959 and 2005. Rabbi Joshua Stanton, vice president of interfaith initiatives for Jewish Federations of North America, views it as an opportunity for learning, collaboration and togetherness.",

      "The convergence of holidays also offer unique opportunities and challenges for interfaith families. Some people celebrate what's known as \"Chrismukkah,\" a name derived from the overlap of the holidays that was made popular by the television series \"The O.C.\"",
      "\"I think that, especially as Hanukkah has become seen as kind of the Jewish Christmas, we are seeing more and more interest in sort of how they might correspond to one another. Both holidays are interested in light and in God's presence in dark times,\" Candida Moss, a professor of theology at the University of Birmingham,\u00a0told CBS News. \"And of course this presents a huge opportunity for interfaith families to celebrate both traditions alongside one another.\"",

    "summary": "Mobile phone footage circulating online appeared to show the Azerbaijani Airlines plane making a steep descent before slamming into the ground in a fireball in western Kazakhstan.",
    "story": [
      "Moscow \u2014 An Azerbaijani airliner with 67 people on board crashed Wednesday in western Kazakhstan, near the city of Aktau, killing 38 people and leaving 29 survivors, a Kazakh official said.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Kanat Bozumbaev disclosed the figures while meeting with Azerbaijani officials, the Russian news agency Interfax reported.",
      "Azerbaijan Airlines said 67 people were on board \u2014 62 passengers and five crew members. Interfax quoted emergency workers at the scene as saying a preliminary assessment showed both pilots died in the crash.",
      "The Embraer 190 aircraft attempted to make an emergency landing roughly two miles from Aktau, Azerbaijan Airlines said. A spokesperson for Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency said preliminary information showed the pilot had chosen to divert to Aktau after a bird strike led to \"an emergency situation on board.\"",
      "Kazakhstan's Emergency Ministry initially said 25 people survived the crash, later revising that number to 27, 28 and then 29 as the search and rescue operation continued at the site of the crash, bringing the apparent death toll down.",
      "The Prosecutor General's Office in Azerbaijan reported earlier that at least 32 people had survived the crash, but said the number wasn't final.",
      "According to Kazakh officials, those aboard the plane included 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhs and three Kyrgyzstan nationals.",
      "The plane was originally scheduled to travel from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus. Russian news agencies said the plane had been rerouted due to fog in Grozny, Reuters reported.",
      "Interfax reported that Kazakh authorities said they'd started probing possible causes of the crash, including a technical problem, according to Reuters.",
      "Mobile phone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground in a fireball. Crews put out the blaze at the site, the emergency ministry said.",
      "Other footage showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rest of the aircraft lying upside in the grass. The footage corresponded to the plane's colors and its registration number.",
      "Some of the videos posted on social media showed survivors dragging fellow passengers away from the plane's wreckage.",
      "Unverified video showed people stumbling from a piece of the fuselage that remained intact, Reuters reported.",
      "Flight-tracking data from FlightRadar24.com showed the aircraft making what appeared to be a figure-right as it neared the airport in Aktau, its altitude moving up and down substantially over the last minutes of the flight before impacting the ground.",
      "FlightRadar24 separately said in an online post that the aircraft had faced \"strong GPS jamming\" which \" made the aircraft transmit bad ADS-B data,\" referring to the information that enables flight-tracking websites to follow planes in flight. Russia has been blamed in the past for jamming GPS transmissions in the wider region.",
      "Embraer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday morning. In a statement, Azerbaijan Airlines said it would keep members of the public updated and changed its social media banners to solid black.",
      "When reached by CBS News, a National Security Council spokesperson said that the White House had seen the media reports of the crash and referred CBS News \"to Azerbaijani and Kazakhstani officials as the investigation continues.\"",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis delivered a plea for peace in a world torn by conflict in his 2024 Christmas Day \"Urbi et Orbi\" (\"To the City and the World\") address. It came as Christmas marked the start of the 2025 Holy Year celebration that is expected to bring some 32 million Catholic faithful to Rome.",
      "\"I invite every individual, and all people of all nations ... to become pilgrims of hope, to silence the sounds of arms and overcome divisions,\" the pontiff said, speaking from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to a crowd of thousands of people in the square below.",
      "He urged negotiations between\u00a0Ukraine and Russia\u00a0to \"achieve a just and lasting peace\" and end the war that has killed tens of thousands since Moscow's full-scale invasion more than two years ago. The conflict did not pause for the holiday, as Russia carried out what it called a\u00a0\"massive strike\" targeting energy facilities\u00a0in Ukraine on Christmas Day.",
      "Pope Francis also renewed his call for a ceasefire in the\u00a0Israel-Hamas war, calling\u00a0 the\u00a0humanitarian crisis in Gaza\u00a0\"extremely grave,\" and urged the release of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas.",
      "He encouraged people around the world \"to tear down all walls of separation,\" and remembered children suffering from war and hunger, the elderly living in solitude, those fleeing their homelands, and those persecuted for their faith.",
      "Pilgrims lined up early Wednesday to walk through the great Holy Door at the entrance of St. Peter's Basilica for Christmas observances. On Christmas Eve, Pope Francis knocked on the door and was the first to enter through it, inaugurating the 2025 Jubilee that he dedicated to hope.",
      "Traversing the Holy Door is one way that the faithful can obtain indulgences, or forgiveness for sins during a Jubilee, a once-every-quarter-century tradition that dates from 1300.",
      "\"You feel so humble when you go through the door that once you go through is almost like a release, a release of emotions,'' said Blanca Martin, a pilgrim from San Diego. \"... It's almost like a release of emotions, you feel like now you are able to let go and put everything in the hands of God. See I am getting emotional. It's just a beautiful experience.\"",
      "Visitors submitted to security controls before entering the Holy Door, amid new security fears following a deadly Christmas market attack in Germany. Many paused to touch the door as they passed and made the sign of the cross upon entering the basilica dedicated to St. Peter, founder of the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "Inside, the beauty of a\u00a0newly restored St. Peter's Basilica was revealed after extensive restoration work was undertaken in preparation for the Jubilee Year.",
      "One of the most significant restorations is of\u00a0Bernini's Baldachin, a canopy that sits atop\u00a0the tomb of St. Peter, removing centuries of grime to showcase its gleaming gold finish.

      "While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it's taking place this year as wars rage in the Middle East and fears rise over widespread incidents of antisemitism. The holidays overlap infrequently because the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar, which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005.",
      "Germany's celebrations muted after market attack",

      "\"In the early hours of Christmas, Russia launched waves of missiles and drones against Ukrainian cities and critical energy infrastructure.

      "The king, who was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, waved to a large crowd of onlookers as he walked alongside his wife, Queen Camilla. They were joined by Prince William, Prince of Wales, and his wife Catherine, Princess of Wales, the king's daughter-in-law, who has been slowly returning\u00a0to public duties after her own cancer diagnosis and a course of chemotherapy.",
      "In a reflection of the medical treatments they have received, Charles used his annual Christmas message to highlight health workers.",
      "\"From a personal point of view, I offer special heartfelt thanks to the selfless doctors and nurses who this year have supported me and other members of my family through the uncertainties and anxieties of illness, and have helped provide the strength, care and comfort we have needed,\" Charles said in his remarks, broadcast to millions of viewers in the United Kingdom and across the Commonwealth.",

      "This is the king's third Christmas speech since he ascended the throne after his mother, Queen Elizabeth, died in September 2022. It is the first since he was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February.",
      "Charles' speech was recorded on Dec. 11 at Fitzrovia Chapel in London, which was part of the now-demolished Middlesex Hospital where his first wife, Diana, opened London's first dedicated ward for those with AIDS. The building is richly decorated in a Gothic Revival style featuring more than 500 stars in a gold leaf ceiling.",

      "Prince Andrew absent at Christmas event",
      "One familiar face was absent from the traditional scene outside St. Mary Magdalene Church: Prince Andrew. The king's 64-year-old brother has retreated further into the shadows amid news that a Chinese businessman had been barred from the U.K. because of concerns he cultivated links with Andrew on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has become a constant source of tabloid fodder because of his money woes and links to questionable characters, including the late American financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Even though Andrew had stepped back from public duties, he has continued to appear at family events and his absence from Sandringham suggests a further retreat from the public eye. The king has been under pressure to put more distance between Andrew and the royal family to avoid further embarrassment to the monarchy.",
      "While Andrew has said he never discussed anything sensitive with the suspected Chinese spy and that he ceased contact with the man as soon as concerns were raised, the scandal raises further questions about his judgment and distracts from the work of the royal family, said Ed Owens, author of \"After Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?''",
      "\"The reason why this is a problem for the king is simply that the king is trying to rebrand the monarchy at the moment, centering its focus around him, but also around William, Catherine, what they are trying to do,\" Owens said.",
      "\"It's been a very difficult year for the monarchy, not least because of the two cancer diagnoses.

    "story": [
      "A Russian cargo ship sank in the Mediterranean Sea between Spain and Algeria, leaving two crew members missing, Spain's maritime rescue agency and the Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.",
      "Fourteen of the Ursa Major's crew were rescued uninjured from a lifeboat and transferred to Spain, the agency said. The Russian ministry said the ship started sinking following an explosion in the engine room.",
      "The vessel was owned by SK-Yug, a subsidiary of the Russian shipping and logistics company Oboronlogistika, which was established under Russia's defense ministry and placed under U.S. and European Union sanctions for its ties to Russia's military.",
      "Spanish authorities said there were empty containers and two cranes on board. They did not confirm the cause of the accident.",
      "In a statement on Dec. 20, Oboronlogistika said the cargo ship was headed to Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok carrying two cranes for the port weighing 380 tons each. Ursa Major had left St. Petersburg 12 days ago, Russian state news agency Ria Novosti said.",
      "Spanish authorities said they received an alert around 1 p.m. Monday when the vessel was roughly 57 nautical miles from Almer\u00eda in southeastern Spain. The maritime rescue agency contacted a ship nearby that reported poor weather conditions, a lifeboat in the water and the Ursa Major listing.",
      "Authorities said a Russian warship arrived later Monday to oversee rescue operations, and the 142-meter cargo vessel sank around midnight. The Russian embassy in Spain told RIA Novosti it was investigating the accident and was in contact with local authorities.",
      "Ursa Major was in the western Mediterranean at the same time as Sparta - another Russian cargo ship under U.S. sanctions - whose destination as reported Tuesday was Port Said in Egypt, according to ship-spotting platform MarineTraffic.com.",
      "It's not unusual for Russian ships going from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok to transit through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. With global warming, the Northern Sea Route via Russia's Arctic is increasingly traversed year-round, but most ships still choose the southern route in winter.",
      "Spanish maritime rescue units remained in the area Tuesday to monitor for pollution and remove any floating objects that could be dangerous for navigation, authorities said.",

    "summary": "An ancient shipwreck that dates back to the 7th century B.C.E. has been removed from waters off Spain, two decades after its discovery in 1994.",
    "story": [
      "Spanish archaeologists have successfully removed a 2,600-year-old shipwreck from waters off the country's southeastern coast, two decades after the relic was initially found, officials said.",
      "The ancient Phoenician shipwreck dates back to the 7th century B.C.E. It was discovered in 1994 off the coast of Murcia in southeastern Spain, near the town of Mazarr\u00f3n,\u00a0according to Spain's Ministry of Culture.",
      "Now called the Mazarr\u00f3n II, this shipwreck was one of two located in that same general area. The first, called Mazarr\u00f3n I, was initially located in 1993, lifted from the water in June 1995, and put on display at Spain's National Museum of Underwater Archaeology in 2005 after undergoing years of conservation treatments, the museum said.",
      "Mazarr\u00f3n II is of particular interest to archaeologists and researchers because it is one of only a few Phoenician-era shipwrecks discovered largely intact, said Carlos de Juan, the director of the excavation project, in a video shared by the University of Valencia. The university partnered with the regional culture ministry in Murcia to carry out the excavation.",
      "A team of 14 specialists worked with de Juan to lift the shipwreck from the sea in less than two months, beginning the project Sept. 13 and finishing Nov. 7. Video shows divers carrying wooden fragments of the wreck to the surface in pieces.",
      "Phoenicia was an ancient civilization along the eastern Mediterranean coast, in the area of modern-day Lebanon, Syria and Israel, which existed from about 1500 to 300 B.C.E. Although historians say Phoenicians thrived for a time on trade and developed an alphabet that formed the basis for the ones later produced by ancient Greece and Rome, many traces of the civilization were considered lost until the 20th century.",
      "Artifacts like Mazarr\u00f3n II can help shed light on Phoenician culture, said de Juan. He noted in his comments to the University of Valencia that little is known about Phoenician naval construction, even now, despite the wealth of information about ships built nearby in the Mediterranean by the ancient Greeks.",
      "\"Therefore, this wreck is a very important contribution to this area of study,\" de Juan said. He noted that elements of the Mazarr\u00f3n II are similar to construction designs seen in cultures throughout the surrounding region, but some are distinctive and mysterious, at least for now.",
      "Each piece of the shipwreck has been transferred to a laboratory at the Museum of Underwater Archaeology, in southern Spain. The lab will work carefully to conserve its remains, in a process that will likely take several more years.",

      "The heaviest sentence imposed was six months in prison for a man identified as Sefa O. for public violence against several people.",
      "The Maccabi Tel Aviv fans came under \"hit-and-run\" style attacks in the early hours of Nov. 8 after their European League match against Amsterdam giant Ajax.",
      "Images of the violence, which left five fans briefly hospitalized, went around the world and sparked a furious reaction in Israel \u2014 including accusations of a \"pogrom.\"",
      "The most serious case under consideration Tuesday was that of a man identified as O., who prosecutors said played a \"leading role\" in the violence. The court saw images of the suspect kicking a person on the ground, chasing targets and punching people in the head and body.",
      "The prosecutor said the beatings had \"little to do\" with soccer, but added that \"in this case, there was no evidence of ... a terrorist intent and the violence was not motivated by antisemitic sentiment.\"",
      "\"The violence was influenced by the situation in Gaza, not by antisemitism,\" said the prosecutor.",
      "The attacks followed two days of skirmishes that also saw Maccabi fans chant anti-Arab songs, vandalize a taxi and burn a Palestinian flag.",

      "Colombia's national immigration agency promptly posted a brief statement on the social media platform X, saying Ochoa was \"freed so that he could join his family\" after immigration officials took his fingerprints and confirmed through a database that he is not wanted by Colombian authorities.",
      "Ochoa, 67, and his older brothers amassed a fortune when cocaine started flooding the U.S. in the late 1970s and early 1980s, according to U.S. authorities, to the point that in 1987 they were included in the Forbes Magazine's list of billionaires.",

      "Along with his two older brothers, Juan David and Jorge Luis, Ochoa turned himself in to Colombian authorities in the early 1990s under a deal in which they avoided being extradited to the U.S.",
      "The three brothers were released from prison in 1996, but Ochoa was arrested again three years later for drug trafficking and was extradited to the U.S. in 2001 in response to an indictment in Miami naming him and more than 40 people as part of a drug smuggling conspiracy.",
      "He was the only suspect in that group who opted to go to trial, resulting in his conviction and a 30-year sentence. The other defendants got much lighter prison terms because most of them cooperated with the government.",
      "Ochoa's name has faded from popular memory as Mexican drug traffickers take center stage in the global drug trade.",
      "But the former member of the Medellin cartel was recently depicted in the Netflix series Griselda, where he first fights the plucky businesswoman Griselda Blanco for control of Miami's cocaine market and then makes an alliance with the drug trafficker, played by Sofia Vergara.",

      "Lily Wilmoth, the company's founder and president, spoke with Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview about the skyrocketing demand for beef tallow.",
      "Hearth and Homestead founder Lily Wilmoth is pictured with her husband and five children. \"The biggest product for us has always been our tallow-based skincare products,\" she told Fox News Digital. (Hearth and Homestead)",
      "\"It\u2019s bigger than ever,\" she said. \"The biggest product for us has always been our tallow-based skincare products.\"",
      "How is beef tallow made?",
      "Wilmoth revealed that her tallow balm is made from 100% grass-fed beef suet, or the fat that encases a cow's kidney, which is sourced from farms across the country.",
      "The fat is harvested, ground and rendered before it is melted down with herb-infused olive oil, and is then whipped, cooled and jarred, she said.",

      "\"It's not the back fat or other types of fat that you might find on your steak,\" Wilmoth said. \"It's a very specific fat \u2026 our ancestors recognized that this fat was special.\"",
      "\"It has a higher amount of nutrients than all the other fats in the animal,\" she went on. \"It's very creamy and white in texture. It doesn't have a weird smell or taste.\"",

      "\"One reason for this is that the holiday season often involves changes in daily routines,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"People living with dementia often need to maintain a daily routine. This consistency can help them feel more secure and reduce anxiety.\"",

      "\"Encourage visitors to be patient, avoid correcting or interrupting, and give your loved one time to express themselves,\" she suggested to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"A little preparation and understanding helps create a more positive atmosphere.\"",

      "\"If changes are necessary, make them gradually and communicate them clearly,\" she advised.",

      "Emotional support is just as important as physical care, Corwin-Irwin noted.",
      "\"Your loved one might feel sad, anxious or overwhelmed during the holidays,\" she said. \"It\u2019s important to validate their feelings and provide reassurance.\"",
      "\"Stick to familiar and nostalgic decorations, avoiding flashing lights or loud sounds that might be overstimulating,\" a geriatric nurse practitioner suggested.\u00a0 (iStock)",

      "Much of that is due to her stance on abortion. But Kaptur\u2019s experience and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s experience bring this debate full circle. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., advocated for Connolly over the New York Democrat. And for years, Kaptur asserts that the powerful Pelosi blocked her ascension, too.",
      "\"In the case of the Appropriations Committee, the people that get elected in my party tend to come from the coasts,\" observed Kaptur, saying it took her a decade to even get a slot on the Appropriations roster. \"I had to defeat Nancy Pelosi to do that on about five ballots. I began to understand the way this organization called \u2018Congress\u2019 functions.\"",

      "Kaptur believes the party must focus on \"bread-and-butter issues at home\" if they\u2019re going to reclaim the voters who President-elect Trump scored in November.",
      "\"The President-elect was correct when he talked about prices when he went to a McDonald\u2019s. That\u2019s where so many of my constituents work and eat,\" said Kaptur.",
      "She added that Trump\u2019s ride in a garbage truck sealed the deal with working-class Americans.",
      "\"He artfully identified with their plight,\" said Kaptur.",
      "That characterization from Kaptur is the quintessential distillation of the entire presidential race. It explains many of the reasons why Trump won. It underscored how Democrats struggle to speak to \"working class\" Americans and those who reside in the middle of the country.",
      "The tug-of-war will continue for Democrats as moderates and progressives \u2014 plus newcomers and the older guard \u2014 scrap over the future of the party.",
      "But it\u2019s hard to argue with Kaptur \u2014 both from electoral experience and politics. She won re-election in a state carried by Trump. That\u2019s to say nothing of Sen.-elect Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, winning statewide, as well.",

      "When it comes to choice spots on key committees, Democrats have ignored lawmakers like Kaptur and shut them out. Ocasio-Cortez lost to Connolly. Raskin, Huffman and Craig are now the top Democrats on several committees. It\u2019s a mixture of younger members, but more pragmatism. Does it mean Democrats got the message? Not necessarily.",

      "1. Cancel Christmas altogether",
      "For one HuffPost contributor, the election of Trump wasn't just a political turning point \u2014 it was a holiday deal-breaker. Faced with the knowledge that her husband and his family voted for the former president, she decided to cancel both Thanksgiving and Christmas altogether.

I will not unwrap gifts given to me by people who voted for a party that has talked about building internment camps and mass deportation.\"",

      "\"There is a push, I think just a societal norm that if somebody is your family, that they are entitled to your time, and I think the answer is absolutely not,\" Calhoun told the talk show host. \"So if you are going to a situation where you have family members, where you have close friends who you know have voted in ways that are against you, like what you said, against your livelihood, it\u2019s completely fine to not be around those people and to tell them why, you know, to say, \u2018I have a problem with the way that you voted, because it went against my very livelihood and I\u2019m not going to be around you this holiday.\u2019\"",

      "The top pick? A simple yet stern declaration: \"I won\u2019t be talking about politics today.\" Framed as a way to create a politics-free safe zone, the advice encourages setting boundaries with relatives whose views you loathe \u2014 so you can focus on what really matters.",

Whether the conversation veers into a political minefield or Uncle Bob just won\u2019t stop, the AP suggests calmly excusing yourself from the fray. No need for a dramatic exit \u2014 just a composed stroll to the kitchen, the porch, or anywhere that isn\u2019t the battlefield of your family table.",

      "\"I would say 100%,\u00a0I would bet that he is alive, or at least was as of two weeks ago,\" Stern told Fox News Digital from his hotel room in Syria. \"I would bet that he's being cared for and tended to,\" he went on.",
      "\"I further submit that, he's findable,\" he went on. \"We don\u2019t recover dead bodies. Not to say that we wouldn\u2019t, but we\u2019re a nonprofit, we wouldn\u2019t be putting resources toward that, freezing to death, missing my fourth Christmas with my family, if I didn\u2019t believe he was alive and findable.\"",

      "\"We have done 12 jailbreaks from Russia,\" said Stern. \"That is 12 more than the CIA.\"",

      "\"He could have died of a stomach bug three years ago. And we just don't know. I don't think that that's the case,\" said Stern. \"I have no reason to believe that that's the case.

      "The most likely scenario, according to Stern, is that Tice is being detained in a home in a neighborhood, looked after by Assad-friendly Alawites, the same branch of Islam as the former leader. Many of the country's prisons have now been searched or emptied and he doesn't believe President Vladimir Putin would hold Tice in Russia.",

      "Another group working with Grey Bull asserted this week that they believe Tice is alive.",

According to a July 2024 warning from the\u00a0FBI and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, these scams are part of the cartel's efforts to diversify their revenue streams and finance other criminal activities, including drug trafficking.",
      "Since at least 2012, the cartel and other Mexico-based transnational criminal organizations have increasingly targeted U.S. owners of timeshare properties in Mexico, particularly older adults who are often more vulnerable to such scams. The proceeds from these fraudulent activities not only support the cartel's operations but also contribute to the manufacturing and trafficking of dangerous substances like fentanyl into the United States.",
      "8 PHISHING SCAMS TO WATCH OUT FOR THIS HOLIDAY SEASON",
      "How these scams work",
      "The Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) has expanded its criminal activities beyond traditional drug trafficking into sophisticated scams, including timeshare fraud targeting unsuspecting individuals, particularly Americans. Here are some of the methods employed by the cartel in executing these scams:",
      "Impersonation of legitimate entities: Scammers often pose as legitimate real estate agents, escrow companies or even officials from U.S. government agencies like the Treasury Department. This tactic is designed to instill a sense of trust and urgency in potential victims, making them more susceptible to fraud.",
      "Targeting vulnerable populations: The cartel primarily targets elderly Americans who own timeshares in Mexico. These individuals are often contacted with offers to buy their timeshares at inflated values, but they are required to pay various fees upfront, such as taxes or closing costs, before any transaction can be completed. Once these payments are made, the scammers disappear, leaving victims with significant financial losses.",
      "Use of call centers: The CJNG operates illegal call centers where employees, often unaware of the cartel's true nature, engage in telemarketing schemes. These centers are strategically located in regions with high unemployment rates, providing a pool of workers who may be desperate for jobs. The call centers not only facilitate scams but also serve as a means for the cartel to exert control over local populations through intimidation and violence.",
      "Complex fraud schemes: The scams can involve multiple layers of deception. For instance, victims may be contacted multiple times by different scammers posing as various professionals (e.g., lawyers or real estate agents) who claim they can assist with selling their timeshares or recovering lost funds. This re-victimization often leads to further financial exploitation.",
      "Violence and intimidation: The cartel employs extreme measures to maintain control over its operations and silence potential whistleblowers. Reports indicate that workers attempting to quit these call centers have faced dire consequences, including murder, which serves as a chilling message to others considering leaving the cartel's employment. This brutal enforcement mechanism not only protects their operations but also instills fear within communities.",
      "Digital infrastructure: The CJNG utilizes a network of fraudulent websites and domains that appear legitimate at first glance. These websites often mimic real escrow and real estate firms, making it difficult for victims to discern the authenticity of their interactions. Many of these domains have been linked back to a central hub that manages multiple scam operations simultaneously.",
      "By understanding these operational tactics, you can better appreciate the complexities and dangers associated with scams perpetrated by organized crime groups like the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. This knowledge is crucial for potentially preventing future victimization.",

      "Protecting yourself from timeshare scams",
      "To avoid falling victim to similar scams, it is crucial to take proactive steps to safeguard your financial interests:",
      "1) Verify the buyer's identity and offer legitimacy: Always confirm the identity of any potential buyer and the authenticity of their offer. Contact the timeshare company directly to validate any claims made by the buyer.",
      "2) Research any company that contacts you: Conduct thorough research on any business reaching out to you. Look for reviews, complaints and verify their credentials through reliable sources.",
      "3) Be wary of upfront fees: Legitimate transactions typically do not require upfront fees for administrative or processing purposes. If a company requests such payments, exercise caution.",
      "4) Use secure communication channels: Avoid sharing personal or financial information over unsecured methods such as phone calls or emails. Opt for secure communication channels whenever possible.",
      "5) Do not click on links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails. Scammers often use these tactics to steal your personal information. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Consult with professionals before proceeding with transactions: Seek advice from a real estate attorney or a trusted financial advisor before engaging in any transactions. Their expertise can help you navigate potential pitfalls.",
      "7) Report suspicious activity to authorities: If you suspect you've been targeted by a timeshare scam, don't hesitate to promptly report it to local authorities, the\u00a0FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov or the Federal Trade Commission. Reporting can help protect others from falling victim to similar schemes.",
      "8) Invest in personal data removal services: While the advice provided is valuable, the most crucial step in protecting yourself from such scams is to minimize your online presence. By reducing the amount of personal information available on the web, you make it significantly harder for scammers to target you. No service promises to remove all your data from the internet. However, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Remember, knowledge is power. By staying informed and skeptical, you're already one step ahead of these fraudsters. Trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is.

      "If you\u2019re like me, your home Wi-Fi is at the center of almost everything you do online, whether it\u2019s online banking, paying bills, booking trips, chatting with friends or streaming movies.",
      "These days, it\u2019s not just your laptop and phone connected to the network, but also things like security cameras, thermostats and even air conditioners are all managed by your router. But be honest, when was the last time you did anything to secure your router? It\u2019s easy to forget about it, especially if it\u2019s working fine. The thing is, a lot of people feel the same way, and a study reveals this \"out of sight, out of mind\" attitude could be putting millions at serious risk.",

      "Shocking router security facts you need to know",
      "The\u00a02024 Broadband Genie router security survey has uncovered some startling facts about how internet users approach router security. Over half of respondents (52%) admitted they have never adjusted their router\u2019s factory settings. Even more concerning, 86% of users have never changed their router administrator password. Leaving the default admin password unchanged is like leaving your front door unlocked. It\u2019s an open invitation for hackers to exploit.",
      "Similarly, 72% of respondents have never changed their Wi-Fi password. Default passwords are often easily accessible and can be exploited in seconds by knowledgeable attackers. Firmware updates, essential for patching vulnerabilities and enhancing router functionality, are also largely ignored. An overwhelming 89% of users have never updated their router\u2019s firmware. While newer routers often handle updates automatically, user awareness and action remain vital for those with older devices.",
      "Another glaring issue is the failure to change default network names, such as \"SKY12345\" or \"Linksys-7890.\" These identifiers can provide hackers with crucial information about the router model, making it easier to exploit known vulnerabilities. Yet, 89% of respondents have never changed their network name.",

      "CLEVER TRICK TO MAKE A CONNECTION FASTER ON YOUR WI-FI NETWORK",
      "Most people don\u2019t know who\u2019s connected to their network",
      "Alarmingly, 75% of users have never checked to see who is connected to their network. With an average home now hosting around 12 connected devices, failing to monitor network activity could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Even more worrying, three-quarters of respondents do not understand why adjusting router settings is important, showing a significant gap in awareness about the risks associated with default configurations.",
      "\"In 2022, we ran a similar study and found 48% had never touched their router's factory settings. It\u2019s concerning that not only has the number come down after two years, it\u2019s got worse,\" said Alex Tofts, strategist at Broadband Genie.",
      "\"Most concerning is the very high percentage of broadband subscribers who don\u2019t even know why they should be making any of these changes. This exposes a clear knowledge gap, and users need to be educated more about the simple steps they can take to help prevent cyberattacks.\"",

      "HOW TO CHECK IF SOMEONE IS STEALING YOUR WI-FI",
      "6 ways to protect your Wi-Fi router from hackers",
      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "1) Change default passwords:\u00a0Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "2) Rename your network (SSID):\u00a0The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router\u2019s brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn\u2019t reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that\u2019s easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "3) Keep your router\u2019s firmware updated:\u00a0Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router\u2019s admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you\u2019re protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "4) Monitor network activity regularly:\u00a0Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router\u2019s admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",
      "5) Enable network encryption: Use the strongest encryption protocol available for your router, preferably WPA3 or at least WPA2. Encryption scrambles the data transmitted over your network, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and decipher your information.",
      "6) Regularly reboot your router: Schedule routine reboots to clear the system memory and refresh all connections, which may disrupt potential malware.",
      "TOP ROUTERS FOR BEST SECURITY 2024",
      "Pro tip: Use strong antivirus software: To further protect your devices from malware and other threats, consider using reputable antivirus software. Antivirus programs can detect and remove malicious software, provide real-time protection and alert you to potential threats. Keeping your devices secure helps ensure your entire network remains safe from cyberattacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals are constantly evolving the ways they target us, which means securing just your phone or laptop isn\u2019t enough anymore. You need to be cautious with anything connected to the internet, whether it's your router, smart cameras or doorbell. However, the Broadband Genie survey reveals that only a small number of people are aware of the best cybersecurity practices when it comes to protecting their routers. As a basic rule, always remember to change default passwords and rename your router\u2019s network to ensure better security.",

During this time, an unknown hacker gained access to the platform and pulled data from provider-patient communications. ConnectOnCall helps health care providers handle after-hours communication and automate patient call tracking.",
      "Phreesia, which bought ConnectOnCall in October 2023, discovered the breach on May 12 and says it jumped into action right away. The company brought in external cybersecurity pros to lock down the platform and reported the breach to federal law enforcement.",
      "\"On May 12, 2024, ConnectOnCall learned of an issue impacting ConnectOnCall and immediately began an investigation and took steps to secure the product and ensure the overall security of its environment,\" the company\u00a0revealed in a press release.",

      "Use patient portals provided by health care providers to access your medical records online. These portals often have features that allow you to track your medical history and appointments.",
      "2) Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA): Create strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, including health care portals. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code or authentication app, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Don\u2019t fall for phishing scams; use strong antivirus software: Be mindful of the information you share online and with whom you share it. Avoid providing sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical details, unless absolutely necessary. Verify the legitimacy of any requests for personal information. Scammers often pose as health care providers or insurance companies to trick you into revealing sensitive data by asking you to click on links in emails or messages.",

      "5) Use identity theft protection services: Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential threats. These services can help you detect and respond to identity theft more quickly. Some identity theft protection services also offer insurance and assistance with recovering from identity theft, providing additional peace of mind.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "6) Freeze your credit:\u00a0A credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name without your authorization, reducing the risk of identity theft. Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to request a credit freeze. This is often free and can be temporarily lifted when you need to apply for credit.",
      "7) Remove your personal data from the internet: After being part of a data breach, it\u2019s crucial to minimize your online presence to reduce the risk of future scams. Consider using a personal data removal service that can help you delete your information from various websites and data brokers. This can greatly diminish the chances of your data being used maliciously.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "DON\u2019T LET SNOOPS NEARBY LISTEN TO YOUR VOICEMAIL WITH THIS QUICK TIP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The ConnectOnCall health data breach highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures within the health care sector, where the stakes are often much higher than in other industries. With over 910,000 patients affected, this incident shows the serious risks posed by cyberattacks on health care platforms. Sensitive data like medical records and Social Security numbers are permanent and can be misused for identity theft and fraud. If you were impacted, stay vigilant by monitoring your accounts, enabling fraud alerts and considering identity theft protection services.",

It\u2019s easy to grow complacent, essentially leaving the door wide open for cybercriminals to walk through. Here are the basics you should never forget to follow:",
      "Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere you can, especially online accounts that hold your financial information.",

      "When hackers compromise one account, they don\u2019t stop there. They use a technique called credential stuffing, by which stolen login details are tested on other platforms. So, if you\u2019ve reused the same password for your bank account, email and favorite shopping site, one data breach can take them all down in one fell swoop.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a perfect memory, capable of memorizing every password you\u2019ll ever need, I recommend using a trusted\u00a0password manager. They can generate and store complex, unique passwords for all your accounts so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself.",

      "Budgeting apps can be a convenient tool for managing your finances, but they also come with potential risks that many users overlook. These apps often share user data with third parties and may request extensive permissions, including access to sensitive personal information. This can raise concerns about privacy and data security, especially if the app lacks robust safeguards. Before using a budgeting app, it\u2019s crucial to carefully review its permissions and data-sharing policies to protect your financial and personal information.",
      "Instead of relying on a budgeting app, consider utilizing your bank's online tools. Many banks offer built-in budgeting and expense-tracking features within their secure online banking platforms. These are typically more privacy-focused than third-party apps.\u00a0 Here are some examples:",

      "These bank-provided tools offer the advantage of being integrated directly with your accounts, potentially providing more accurate and up-to-date information while maintaining a higher level of privacy compared to third-party apps.",
      "If you decide to stick to a budgeting app, though, make sure to check its privacy section on the App Store or Google Play, where you can see what data it collects and shares. Then, read the app's privacy policy carefully, as tedious and often deliberately overcomplicated as that can be.",

      "Unless you go completely off the grid digitally \u2014 no internet, online accounts or smartphones \u2014 it\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid leaving a digital footprint. Most companies collect and share your personal information, which ends up in the hands of data brokers and people-search websites that aggregate and sell it to even more third parties.",
      "Data brokerage is a\u00a0$245.8 billion industry that profits off your personal information at the expense of your privacy and security. Some data brokers have even been caught\u00a0intentionally selling information to scammers. People-search sites also provide an accessible way for anyone, including fraudsters, to get their hands on your personal information.",
      "To mitigate these risks, it\u2019s crucial to periodically remove your information from these databases.

But taking just a few minutes to review your security practices can save you from a world of trouble. Don't wait until it\u2019s too late to protect yourself and your loved ones. Neglecting basic security like two-factor authentication, reusing passwords or shopping on untrustworthy websites can leave you exposed. Using finance apps that share your data, like allowing data brokers to profit off your personal information, also increases your risks of experiencing fraud and identity theft. By staying vigilant, you can protect both your finances and your loved ones.",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 10:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A virtual private network can help ensure your information remains security and your privacy remains intact. Kurt the CyberGuy explains.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy.",
      "Have you ever felt a little uneasy while browsing the internet, wondering who might be watching your online activities?",
      "Well, let me introduce you to a handy tool that can put your mind at ease: the virtual private network, or VPN.",
      "Whether you're working from home, streaming your favorite shows or just exploring the web, a VPN can help ensure that your data stays secure and your privacy intact. So, let\u2019s dive into why having a VPN at home is a smart move.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2014 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "A VPN on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A virtual private network, or VPN, encrypts your internet traffic and reroutes it through a server in a different location than your own. VPNs make it appear that you are connecting to the internet from whichever location the server is hosted in rather than your actual location.",
      "When you first connect to a network using a VPN, your device will establish a secure connection with the VPN server, and your device's IP address will appear as the VPN server, meaning that only your internet service provider will see that you're connecting to a VPN server. Normally, when you connect to a website, the website or any online services you visit can see your device's technical information, including location-sensitive data such as IP addresses.",
      "THE BEST VPNS FOR BROWSING THE WEB IN 2024",
      "Why would you want a VPN at home?",
      "While your home internet connection is more secure than a\u00a0public Wi-Fi connection, VPNs still provide a greater sense of privacy and access to content that might be restricted due to location. Here are 10 reasons I have for getting a home VPN.",
      "Online communication can be hit or miss when it comes to security. Some messaging services, such as Whatsapp, use end-to-end device encryption, which helps keep your messages secure, but other messaging services, such as Skype, don't use end-to-end encryption. If you use a VPN with any communication apps, then all your connection and messaging data between your device and the VPN server is fully encrypted.",
      "A VPN on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Online content and services like Netflix are restricted to specific geographic regions. This content can range from news websites to video streaming platforms and social media apps. Using a VPN at home can appear to be using the internet from another location, allowing you to access restricted services.",
      "Sometimes, an internet service provider (ISP) will slow down bandwidth or certain online activities. One of the most common reasons networks do this is to manage network congestion, especially during peak hours. You might notice that your home internet connection slows down at night, when everyone is home from work, or it might slow down when summer vacation starts. Using a VPN will prevent your service provider from identifying the type of web content you are accessing, making it impossible for your ISP to slow down your traffic.",
      "A VPN also keeps your internet activity private from Wi-Fi network admins, who, if technically skilled enough, can figure out which websites you've visited. If you're worried about the Wi-Fi admin of your office, hotel, school or other public place having access to your browsing history, a VPN is the perfect solution for you. When it comes to your own home Wi-Fi network, a VPN will keep your browsing history private from other household members.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers deploy large-scale cyberattacks to observe network activity and steal your information. These attacks are particularly prevalent on public Wi-Fi networks, which often have minimal security measures, but they can also target secured networks. Using a VPN can significantly enhance your security by providing encryption for your internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers to intercept and read your data. This encryption is especially crucial when using public Wi-Fi, as it secures your information from potential eavesdroppers.",
      "Additionally, a VPN masks your real IP address with that of the VPN server, helping to protect your identity online and making it harder for attackers to target you directly. However, it is essential to understand that while a VPN adds a layer of security,\u00a0it is not a comprehensive solution against all cyber threats.",
      "A VPN does not prevent malware infections or\u00a0phishing attacks, so you must still employ\u00a0strong antivirus software and exercise caution when clicking on links or downloading files.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Furthermore, not all VPNs are created equal; some may have vulnerabilities or questionable privacy practices. It is crucial to choose a\u00a0reputable provider that uses strong encryption and has a clear no-logging policy.",
      "There's a myriad of reasons, ranging from political to economic, that countries use to justify censoring certain apps and websites. It can be incredibly frustrating for citizens and anyone traveling to that country to lose access to email, social media, news websites and other tools that keep us connected to the world around us. I've used VPNs extensively while traveling to ensure that I can always view my most important websites, no matter where I actually am. As I've mentioned, a VPN can mask your IP address and make it appear as traffic from a different country, allowing you to bypass online geographic restrictions.",
      "One of the best reasons to have a VPN at home is that it can help you save money and find better deals while online shopping. Some online retailers change their prices depending on users' locations. However, when using a VPN while shopping for plane tickets, hotels or gifts, it's possible to\u00a0find cheaper prices just by changing your location.",
      "It's no longer the work of sci-fi. We do know that governments, nearly all of them, surveil their citizens. A VPN will add a layer of privacy, making it significantly more difficult for governments to detect your web traffic. Even if you feel that you have nothing to hide, online privacy is something you should feel free to exercise.",
      "Much like governments, your ISP can surveil your online activity with ease. While most ISPs claim that they don't sell your browsing data, they are often allowed through contracts with marketing agencies to give your data away for free to advertise to you. The simplest way to hide your online activity from your ISP is to use a VPN. When using a VPN, your ISP won't be able to see which websites you visit or which apps you use.",
      "Image of a Google search on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW VPNS SHIELD YOUR IDENTITY AND SECURE YOUR FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS FROM THEFT",
      "While it may seem counterintuitive, a VPN can offer faster connection speeds for online gaming. It can also help prevent your ISP from throttling bandwidth directly from gaming servers. By changing your VPN's location, you can connect to a server closer to your gaming server, which will give you better latency. This is also called ping, which determines how fast the server responds to your inputs.",

      "His project, DartSolar, harnesses solar energy while the car is parked, potentially adding up to 20 extra miles of driving range each day without ever needing to plug in. As he gets ready to roll out the next iteration, Beta2, let\u2019s explore what makes this innovation so groundbreaking.",

      "Rooftop solar panel system (DartSolar)",
      "The concept behind DartSolar",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) often spend significant time parked in open spaces, making them ideal candidates for solar energy collection. Sadeghpour's vision is simple yet effective: why not utilize the sun's energy to charge EVs while they are stationary? This concept forms the foundation of the DartSolar project.",
      "DartSolar isn\u2019t just about innovation; it\u2019s also about practicality. Imagine a rooftop solar panel that\u2019s aerodynamic, weatherproof, theft-resistant and easy to use. It opens in just 10 seconds with the same effort required to open your car door. These panels are tough, too, built to withstand wind, rain, sand and snow, ensuring reliable performance in all conditions.",

      "The beta 1 prototype",
      "Omid Sadeghpour's initial prototype, known as Beta 1, was built in collaboration with Jeran Bruce at California's Forged Makerspace. This prototype is designed with nine flexible solar panels, each rated at 175 watts, which can be deployed when the vehicle is parked. The structure is made from wood and features telescoping carbon-fiber tubes that allow for easy expansion and retraction.",
      "Weighing in at under 165 pounds, Beta 1 remains within the roof weight capacity of the Tesla Model Y and is designed to fit within a standard U.S. parking space when fully expanded.",
      "When fully deployed, Beta 1 can generate approximately 6 kWh of power per day, which translates to about 20 miles of additional driving range. When it\u2019s time to drive again, the system can be collapsed into a compact rooftop box in under a minute.",

      "Now, let\u2019s talk about the future. Beta 2, the fifth iteration of DartSolar, takes innovation to the next level. This version swaps the wood structure for carbon fiber, cutting its height in half for better aerodynamics. The wattage capacity has also been boosted to a potential 4,000 watts, providing up to 45 miles of range per day under optimal conditions.",
      "Here\u2019s where things get exciting: Beta 2 introduces dynamic charging capabilities. This means the panels can charge the car while driving or in different configurations, like partially opened for better airflow or fully closed during high-speed travel. With a reduced drag loss of just 1%-2%, it\u2019s as efficient on the road as it is when parked.",

      "The painted angels with childlike faces and wings were once among the defining features of Old North Church, the oldest church building in Boston, when they were painted around 1730. But the angels in 1912 were painted over with thick coats of white paint as part of a renovation that restorationists are seeking to reverse.",

      "Researchers knew based on the historical record that the angels were still on the walls, and they still have a copy of a contract signed with John Gibbs, a congregation member who painted them. A paint study conducted in 2017 confirmed they were still on the walls.",
      "Corrine Long, a painting conservator who works with Pocobene, said one of the challenges in restoring the angels was removing seven layers of paint without damaging the angels. Conservators first applied a solvent gel to soften the layers of paint before manually removing it with a plastic scraper. They then cleaned the angels with cotton swabs and retouched to remove any signs of damage.",
      "\"They all have their own character \u2014 they're not copies,\" Pocobene said. \"The artist John Gibbs painted them individually and they\u2019re all in different poses, which gives them a really wonderful rhythmic kind of pattern across the surface of the church.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 14:07:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Biden&apos;s rationale behind his move to commute the sentences of 37 of 40 federal inmates on death row remains unclear, according to crime data expert John Lott.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News contributor Karl Rove discusses the outrage over President Biden's pardons of death row inmates.",
      "President Biden's recent move to commute the sentences of 37 of 40 federal inmates on death row has been met with praise by some and criticism by others, who say it's unclear why the president made the decision in the first place.",
      "The president announced on Monday that 37 federal death-row inmates would have their sentences changed to life in prison without the possibility of parole, with the White House saying in a statement that Biden believes \"America must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level, except in cases of terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.\"",
      "\"When President Biden came into office, his Administration imposed a moratorium on federal executions, and his actions today will prevent the next Administration from carrying out the execution sentences that would not be handed down under current policy and practice,\" the White House said.",
      "The three death-row inmates that did not meet Biden's requirements for having their sentences commuted are: Robert Bowers, the Tree of Life Synagogue shooter who killed 11 people in 2018; Dylann Roof, a White supremacist who killed nine Black parishioners at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015; and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who worked with his now-dead brother to carry out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that killed three people and injured hundreds.",

      "John R. Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and former chief economist for the U.S. Sentencing Commission in Washington, told Fox News Digital that Biden's rationale in deciding to commute the death sentences of 37 federal death-row inmates rather than all 40 remains unclear.",
      "\"There were mass murderers that he commuted the sentence for, and yet there are other ones who killed fewer that he didn't commute the sentence for,\" Lott said. \"When I read his statement, it wasn't obvious to me what his rationale was for dividing the cases the way he did.\"",
      "\"If he thinks the death penalty is wrong, it's not exactly clear where the line was drawn.\"",
      "Lott added that the president \"could just be playing to his base\" in his decision to commute 37 sentences, but noted that victims' families have shared statements expressing how their loved ones were shown no mercy at the hands of those now receiving life sentences instead of death.",
      "BIDEN FACES FURY FOR COMMUTING DEATH SENTENCES FOR KILLERS: \u2018THIS IS TOTALLY NUTS\u2019",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden speaks onstage during the first day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 19, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. (Brandon Bell)",
      "\"A lot of these victims' families have\u2026pointed out that a number of these murderers have shown no remorse for their crimes,\" Lott added. \"They've engaged in brutal rapes and torture. They've killed a number of people in very gruesome ways.\"",
      "Criminal justice reform advocates praised the move.",
      "BIDEN COMMUTES SENTENCES OF 37 DEATH ROW INMATES IN FINAL MONTH OF PRESIDENCY",
      "Matthew Mangino, Of Counsel at Luxenberg, Garbett, Kelly and George and author of \"The Executioner's Toll,\" told Fox News Digital that he thinks Biden's commutations strengthen the argument in favor of the death penalty.",
      "President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden arrive at St. Joseph on the Brandywine Catholic Church in Wilmington, Del., on Wednesday, Dec. 18, 2024. (Ben Curtis)",
      "\"In a strange sort of way, President Biden\u2019s bold use of his clemency power to prevent the systematic execution of federal death row inmates, strengthens the argument for the death penalty,\"\u00a0Mangino said. \"He left three men on death row to most assuredly face death.\"",
      "\"While generally, Biden revealed his disdain for the death penalty, he does believe \u2014 and his actions prove it \u2014 that there needs to be a death penalty for some.\"",
      "United Women in Faith, the largest denominational organization for women, called on Biden to commute the sentences of all 40 federal death-row inmates, saying their organization understands how \"the criminal justice system unfairly and unevenly targets people of color\" in a press release ahead of Biden's Monday decision.",
      "After the president commuted 37 sentences, Emily Jones, executive for Racial Justice at United Women in Faith, praised the move as \"very exciting \u2014 a real Advent blessing!\" in a statement to Fox News Digital.",

      "Lott, however, said that death sentences often inspire criminals to plead guilty to their crimes in order to avoid death, thus allowing governments to avoid costly and emotionally taxing death-penalty trials. Dylann Roof \u2014 one of the three federal inmates Biden decided to keep on death row \u2014 initially expressed interest in pleading guilty in his federal case to avoid the death penalty, Lott noted.",
      "\"Economists have looked at this extensively and found that on average, for each execution that occurs, you'll see a reduction in the number of murders by between about eight and eighteen,\" Lott said. \"That's obviously related to the fact that [the death penalty] is a deterent for these guys.\"",
      "The convicted murderers who will now escape execution include: Marcivicci Barnette, who killed a man in a carjacking and his ex-girlfriend; co-defendants Brandon Basham and Chadrick Fulks, who kidnapped and killed a woman after escaping prison; Anthony Battle, who killed a prison guard; Jason Brown, who stabbed a postal worker to death; Thomas Hager, who committed a drug-related killing; David Runyon, who participated in the murder-for-hire plot of a Naval officer; Thomas Sanders, who kidnapped and killed a 12-year-old girl; Rejon Taylor, who carjacked, kidnapped and killed a restaurant owner; and Alejandro Umana, who killed two brothers inside a restaurant.",
      "Kamala Harris is currently serving as Vice President of the United States for the Biden-Harris administration. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)",
      "The list also includes people who were convicted of murdering witnesses, a military service member, bank guards and employees during robberies and other federal prisoners; as well as people convicted in drug-related murders and one man who directed the murders of 12 people, including six members of a federal informant's family.",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Dec 2024 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Starting Jan. 1, older adults on Medicare will spend no more than $2,000 a year on prescription drugs when a new price cap on out-of-pocket payments from the Inflation Reduction Act goes into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Starting Jan. 1, older adults on Medicare will spend no more than $2,000 a year on prescription drugs when a new price cap on out-of-pocket payments from the Inflation Reduction Act goes into effect.",
      "Experts say the change is expected to provide major relief for cancer patients who often struggle to afford their medications due to the high cost of cancer drugs.",
      "Diana DiVito, of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, recalls the shock she felt after she got her first co-payment for the cancer drug Imbruvica in 2016.",
      "The 83-year-old was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a type of blood cancer that begins in the bone marrow, in 2005. She underwent treatment, including chemotherapy, and went into remission. When she had a recurrence, she started taking Imbruvica.",
      "By 2021, DiVito had spent $56,000 out-of-pocket on the daily pill.",
      "\u201cThe co-pays blew me away,\u201d said DiVito, who added she\u2019s been on limited income since her husband died in 2023. \u201cIt started out the first year was $8,500 out of pocket, and then it went up about $1,000 every year after that.\u201d",
      "The new price cap will apply to all prescription drugs under Medicare Part D; it won\u2019t apply to drugs given to patients in the hospital or other health care settings, such as chemotherapy or anesthesia. Medicare recipients will also have the new option of spreading their payments out over the course of the year, rather than paying a large co-payment all at once.",
      "Before the change, people on Medicare typically had to spend $7,000 or more out of pocket on their prescription drugs before they qualified for so-called catastrophic coverage, when insurance kicks in and covers most of the drug\u2019s cost. Under this coverage, patients are charged a small co-payment or a percentage of a drug\u2019s cost, usually 5%.",
      "Typically, DiVito would hit catastrophic coverage almost immediately after her plan reset each January. While that helped with costs for most of the year, it meant the first few prescriptions she filled were financially painful.",
      "Anticipating the cap next month, DiVito said she has much less stress and is spending a little more freely.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m being a little more generous with my grandchildren this Christmas,\u201d she said.",
      "Millions expected to benefit",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s $2,000 price cap comes after years of public outcry about the soaring cost of prescription drugs, including cancer medications, in the United States.",
      "The law introduced the cap gradually, starting with a cap of $3,250 on out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs in 2024.",
      "More than 65 million people, mainly older adults, are enrolled in Medicare. A study published in September in JAMA Network Open found that annual out-of-pocket costs for cancer medications averaged $11,284 for Medicare Part D beneficiaries in 2023. (Part D refers to coverage for prescription drugs.)",
      "A separate report from the nonprofit group AARP found that 3.2 million Medicare recipients are expected to see savings from the out-of-pocket cap in 2025. By 2029, the number is expected to increase to 4.1 million enrollees. The report didn\u2019t break down savings for people with certain conditions, such as cancer. However, research shows about 60% of cancer cases occur in adults 65 and older.",
      "On average, 1.4 million enrollees who reach the out-of-pocket cap from 2025 to 2029 are estimated to see annual savings of $1,000 or more, the AARP report found, and just over 420,000 will see savings of more than $3,000.",
      "Mary and Jim Scott of Oregon are among the Medicare enrollees expecting to see savings next year.",
      "In 2023, the couple\u2019s out-of-pocket prescription drug expenses skyrocketed to $8,000, up from their previous annual average of $240. It was a difficult year during which Jim, 83, faced multiple serious health issues, including congestive heart failure, an acute kidney injury and bladder cancer.",
      "The new cap won\u2019t apply to drugs given in a health care setting (these are covered under Medicare Part B), meaning Jim will still be responsible for the costs of chemotherapy not covered by his insurance.",
      "Still, Mary, 73, said the change offers a sense of relief after more than a year of struggling with the soaring costs of cancer care, making it easier for the couple to stay afloat and focus on what matters most: Jim\u2019s health, their grandchildren, their dog and their garden.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not planning any amazing trips. We\u2019re still needing to live our low-key lives,\u201d Mary said. \u201cBut by the end of the summer, maybe we\u2019ll be able to put up some new siding on the house and do a few things that we\u2019ve deferred.\u201d",
      "Living on fixed incomes",
      "Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Medicare policy program at KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues, noted that in the nearly 20 years since Medicare Part D was introduced, there has never been an annual cap on out-of-pocket costs.",
      "She co-wrote an analysis that found about 1.5 million people on Medicare had out-of-pocket prescription drug costs exceeding $2,000 in 2021 and would have benefited from the cap. Of the 1.5 million, about 200,000 Medicare enrollees spent $5,000 or more for their prescriptions that year.",
      "\u201cSo, for people who need really expensive drugs or who take a lot of medications where the monthly cost adds up, they may have had to pay several thousands of dollars out of pocket each year,\u201d she said.",
      "Many people on Medicare are retired and live on fixed incomes, Cubanski said, meaning people often go deep into debt or even bankrupt.",
      "Arthur Caplan, the head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, said that\u2019s especially true for cancer patients: A survey from the American Cancer Society\u2019s Cancer Action Network published in May found that nearly half of cancer patients have medical debt, despite most being insured.",
      "\u201cWe have many emerging treatments for cancer,\u201d Caplan said. \u201cThey are hugely expensive.\u201d",
      "Cubanski said that even for those who don\u2019t spend more than $2,000 a year, the cap is still important.",
      "\u201cThe unfortunate truth is we\u2019re all one scary diagnosis away from needing an expensive drug,\u201d she said.",
      "Is $2,000 a year still too high?",
      "George Valentine, 73, of Philadelphia, said he was at his annual physical in 2002 when his doctor noticed something unusual in his test results. Further testing revealed he had chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",
      "The medications he needed came with a hefty price tag \u2014 around $14,000 a month. While he was working in the information technology industry, this wasn\u2019t a major issue because his job-based health insurance included an out-of-pocket maximum, which he hit every year.",
      "However, when Valentine retired in 2019, he discovered a significant gap in Medicare\u2019s coverage. Unlike his previous insurance, Medicare had no out-of-pocket spending limit, leaving him responsible for 5% of his medication costs after reaching the catastrophic coverage phase.",
      "\u201cFive percent of $14,000 is a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cI would get to the catastrophic phase by February in any given year, and for the rest of the year I had this burden of $700 or around there every month and it never ended.\u201d",
      "Valentine, now an advocate for the PAN Foundation, a patient financial assistance group for people with life-threatening chronic conditions, said he would prefer the out-of-pocket cap in the New Year to be \u201czero.\u201d",
      "Still, he added, with the $2,000 cap he can now at least sleep at night.",
      "\u201cAll that matters is when I hit $2,000, I\u2019m done,\u201d he said."

      "Baby orcas are exposed to contaminants through their mothers' milk, which threatens their survival in their first year, the alliance said.",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Dec 2024 14:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Several buzzy films this year featured women in relationships with younger men. Experts weigh in on why the age-gap romance was so popular.",
    "story": [
      "Nicole Kidman wouldn\u2019t describe her latest film, \u201cBabygirl,\u201d as a professional \u201crisk.\u201d",
      "When asked by Zendaya about the project during their Variety Actors on Actors interview, Kidman said she didn\u2019t hesitate to get involved. \u201cAs soon as I heard it was called \u2018Babygirl,\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah. I want to be the babygirl,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "The A24 psychosexual drama, which hits theaters on Christmas, stars Kidman as the CEO of a company who begins an affair with her much-younger male intern (played by Harris Dickinson). For many women in Hollywood, a project like \u201cBabygirl\u201d would likely be considered risky just because of its premise.",
      "Over the years, men have been involved with younger female love interests (both on-screen and off), without many giving it a second thought. Women in similar situations have usually been categorized by society as \u201ccougars.\u201d Yet while some films have featured an older woman entangled with a younger man \u2014 including 1967\u2019s \u201cThe Graduate,\u201d 1971\u2019s \u201cHarold and Maude,\u201d 1998\u2019s \u201cHow Stella Got Her Groove Back\u201d and others \u2014 there\u2019s been a noticeable shift this year.",
      "We allow men to do it all the time. Why can\u2019t we do it?",
      "-Robinne Lee, \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d author",
      "A handful of releases \u2014 including \u201cThe Idea of You,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cLonely Planet\u201d and now, \u201cBabygirl\u201d \u2014 have embraced narratives in which an older woman is romantically involved with a younger man. Audiences have been here for it, too. Each project has generated buzz, particularly among female viewers.",
      "\u201cWomen I think want to see other women as fully fleshed out characters reclaiming their sexuality and their identity in a way we haven\u2019t been able to see often,\u201d said Robinne Lee, who wrote the 2017 book \u201cThe Idea of You\" that the movie was adapted from.",
      "\u201cThey want to see us enjoying ourselves and tapping into this part of who we are,\u201d Lee told NBC News in a recent Zoom interview. \u201cWe allow men to do it all the time. Why can\u2019t we do it?\u201d",
      "Martha Lauzen, the founder and executive director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, suggested the popularity of these recent releases can be explained by at least a couple of factors.",
      "To begin with, Lauzen noted, the films all feature Oscar-winning actresses.",
      "Kidman stars in two of them. In addition to \u201cBabygirl,\u201d she plays a woman who falls in love with her daughter\u2019s movie star boss (played by Zac Efron) in Netflix\u2019s \u201cFamily Affair.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s \u201cThe Idea of You,\u201d released by Amazon Prime Video, starring Anne Hathaway as divorced mom Solene Marchand, who finds herself in a relationship with the young lead singer of the fictional band August Moon (played by Nicholas Galitzine). The film's trailer release in March broke records, months before the film even debuted. Netflix\u2019s \u201cLonely Planet,\u201d released in fall, stars Laura Dern as a writer who finds a connection with a younger man (played by Liam Hemsworth) at a retreat in Morocco.",
      "All the films also \u201coffer an alternative to the traditional romantic narrative,\u201d Lauzen said in an email to NBC News.",
      "\u201cAge is typically associated with power,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe older a character is, the more likely they are to possess personal and/or professional power. The female characters in these films are likely to feel more comfortable in their lives and with themselves than their younger counterparts and are thus likely to navigate their romantic encounters in a different way. Some audience members are likely to find this power differential unique and appealing.\u201d",
      "Brenda Weber, chair and professor in gender studies at Indiana University, also pointed to the timing of the releases. In the aftermath of an election in which gender played a major role, some remain concerned about the future of women\u2019s reproductive rights.",
      "\u201cIt does seem worth thinking about the larger sexual politics in the U.S. right now,\u201d she told NBC News in an email. \u201cGiven how contested reproductive rights have become in the past two years, it\u2019s striking that it is often \u2018the older woman\u2019 \u2014 who might also be perceived as the menopausal and not fertile woman \u2014 who has any capacity to experience a full and rewarding sexual life.\u201d",
      "Like Lauzen, Weber said in \u201csome ways\u201d she does see the recent surge in the trope as \u201ca positive sign about allowing for and fostering women\u2019s power much longer into the life span than popular culture has typically imagined.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think for obvious reasons, it\u2019s good and noteworthy to extend the \u2018sell by\u2019 date for women, and underscoring an \u2018older\u2019 woman as both desiring and desirable has a certain amount of progressive verve to it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does concern me, however, that such an extension is made available only to exceedingly talented and conventionally beautiful people.\u201d",
      "A recent list of more flattering depictions of older women also doesn\u2019t erase past portrayals in film and TV.",
      "Some older movies \u201coffer a truly appalling version of older women and younger men,\u201d Weber said, citing 1950\u2019s \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d as an example. The film \u201cmakes the older woman figure lose her mind and become monstrous in relation to her love for the younger man, whom she kills,\" Weber noted.",
      "Lauzen appeared skeptical about whether the popularity of the trope in 2024 indicates a broader cultural acceptance of the dynamic.",
      "Next year, at least one film features a similar age-gap storyline with an older woman at the center. \u201cBridget Jones Mad About the Boy,\u201d the fourth installment in the franchise, follows the titular character (played by Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) as she navigates dating as a widow and mother of two. Her suitors include a younger man (played by Leo Woodall), as well her son\u2019s teacher (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor). (NBC News and Universal Pictures, the film\u2019s distributor, share Comcast as a parent company.)",
      "It\u2019s unclear how many similar projects are in the pipeline.",
      "\u201cIt is possible that these films will normalize these relationships and clear the way for greater numbers of them,\u201d Lauzen said, \u201cbut the overall numbers for gender and age argue against that happening.\u201d",
      "Lauzen cited research from her annual \u201cIt\u2019s a Man\u2019s (Celluloid) World\u201d report, which examines portrayals of female characters in the top grossing films for the year. The report determined that men continue to be older than their female counterparts on-screen.",
      "\u201cIf we consider the numbers of male and female characters in speaking roles in the top grossing films from 2023, we see that the majority of female characters are in their 20s and 30s and the majority of male characters are in their 30s and 40s,\u201d Lauzen noted.",
      "Still, some, like Lee, are hopeful that soon these types of stories will become mainstream across pop culture.",
      "\u201cMaybe it will become the norm, or just another option, like seeing a same-sex or interracial relationship on screen,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more familiar you are with it, the more it becomes like just another couple.\u201d",
      "At a June red carpet premiere for \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d Kidman reflected on portraying a romance between an older woman and younger man.",
      "\u201cBecause of the nature of the world, it\u2019s always been older men and younger women,\u201d she told Variety. \u201cEveryone\u2019s like \u2018oh my gosh\u2019 \u2026 and I think that needs to be kind of demystified.\u201d"

      "In a nod to that reality, Charles delivered his annual King's Speech from a former hospital chapel \u2014 a break with tradition, and the first time in more than a decade that the Christmas address has not been recorded from a royal palace or estate.",
      "In his speech, Charles extended a \u201cspecial, heartfelt thanks to the selfless doctors and nurses\u201d who he said had \"supported me and other members of my family through the uncertainties and anxieties of illness, and have helped provide the strength, care and comfort we have needed.\"",

      "\u201cI wish you, and all those you love, a most joyful and peaceful Christmas,\u201d Charles said.",
      "Christmas is a \u201creally important occasion for the royal family,\u201d Katie Nicholl, Vanity Fair\u2019s royal correspondent, told NBC News, noting that the last time the public saw the family \u201call out smiling, doing what they love, which is meeting members of the public, was Christmas Day\u201d last year.",

It\u2019s probably been the hardest year of my life,\u201d William told NBC News\u2019 international partner Sky News last month.",
      "Charles and Queen Camilla\u00a0hosted a pre-Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace last week, but William and his family, as well as Charles\u2019 brother Prince Andrew, were among the notable absences.",
      "William and Kate did not attend, as they were already in Norfolk with their three children,\u00a0Prince George,\u00a0Princess Charlotte and\u00a0Prince Louis.",
      "Andrew\u2019s absence, however, was another \u201chuge blow\u201d to him and the family, Emily Nash, royal editor at Hello! magazine, said in an interview with NBC News last Thursday.",
      "The scandal-plagued prince hit headlines again last week after a British High Court ruling said he had cultivated an \u201cunusual degree of trust\u201d with a man alleged to be a\u00a0Chinese spy.\u00a0Andrew\u2019s office said in a statement that he\u00a0\u201cceased all contact with the individual after concerns were raised.\u201d",
      "Andrew had previously been linked to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and in 2021 Virginia Giuffre filed a lawsuit against Andrew accusing him of sexually abusing her on separate occasions in the 1990s, when she was 17.",

      "A onetime war hero, Andrew served in Britain\u2019s Royal Navy and flew a number of missions during the 1982 conflict with Argentina over the remote\u00a0Falkland Islands. He returned his military affiliations and royal patronages\u00a0in January 2022.",
      "\u201cHe has lost any sort of public life and work, and now he\u2019s having to absent himself from private family\u00a0gatherings,\u201d Nash said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about protecting the reputation of the royal family.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in the eye of the storm at the moment,\u201d she added.",

      "Earlier this month, Kate continued a long-standing tradition by hosting her annual carol service at Westminster Abbey in London. The service was closed to the public, though 1,600 members of the community were invited to attend.",

      "In January this year, Kate was hospitalized for nearly two weeks to undergo abdominal surgery for unspecified reasons. Testing revealed she had cancer, and she later disclosed in a rare video statement that she was undergoing chemotherapy, her first public acknowledgment of her health struggles amid widespread speculation.",
      "In September, Kate said she had\u00a0completed chemotherapy treatment\u00a0and would return to a light schedule of public engagements through the end of the year.",

      "He\u00a0resumed public duties\u00a0as king in April after progress was made in his treatment. The illness had raised speculation that Charles may even abdicate the throne, a possibility royal experts say is unlikely but highlighted the challenges to his rule.",
      "An investigation published last month by the U.K.\u2019s Sunday Times and Channel 4\u2019s \u201cDispatches\u201d program uncovered details about about the royal family\u2019s property empires and the tax-free business deals they have struck with taxpayer-funded government institutions to maintain their wealth.",
      "Small anti-monarchy protests also greeted Charles during an October trip to Australia, which is set to vote on a referendum on whether to remain a constitutional monarchy. The death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth, revived debates among Commonwealth countries about leaving the monarchy, with some planning referendums to vote on whether to remove Charles as head of state.",
      "Meanwhile, Camilla, 77, has also faced health challenges. A chest infection caused her to miss last month\u2019s Remembrance events, which honor British and Commonwealth service members who lost their lives in conflict.",

      "Despite the year\u2019s challenges, it has \u201cbrought the royal family so close together, particularly the Princess of Wales and the king,\u201d given their shared experience with cancer, Nicholl said, adding: \u201cI think they\u2019ve never looked tighter as a family.\u201d",
      "However, this closeness within the royal family highlights the divide with Charles\u2019 younger son, Prince Harry.",
      "Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, along with their children, Archie and Lilibet, are not attending Christmas at Sandringham.",
      "Their children have only met their grandfather on \u201cless than a handful of occasions,\u201d Nicholl said. \u201cThere is very much a divide,\u201d both physically and metaphorically, between Harry, who lives in California, and the rest of the royal family.",
      "Although Harry has spoken of his hopes for reconciliation, Nicholl noted, \u201cit does seem some way off.\u201d",
      "Harry\u2019s memoir, released at the start of 2023, made headlines for its revelations and allegations. In the spring, Harry\u00a0officially considered himself a resident of the U.S., according to a U.K. regulatory filing. He and Meghan relocated to California in 2020 after stepping back from royal duties.",
      "\u201cWhile the door has always remained open for the king,\u201d Nicholl said, \u201che wants to have a relationship with his son. There is a fundamental issue that there\u2019s been a breakdown of trust here. I think Harry needs to earn that trust back.\u201d"

      "A Utah trip to enjoy the snow nearly ended in tragedy Tuesday when an avalanche struck a snowmobiler on a backcountry hillside \u2014 but his younger brother rushed to his aid and saved him.",
      "\u201cI could see his hand, his gloves, kind of poking out, waving,\u201d Braeden Hansen said Wednesday, a day after the avalanche buried Hunter Hansen, his brother, in the Franklin Basin, close to the Idaho border.",
      "\u201cBut by the time I got to him, he was about 2 feet, his head was about 2 feet under the snow,\u201d Braeden said.",
      "The avalanche happened at around 8,400 feet elevation, according to the Utah Avalanche Center. The area where it occurred had a \u201cpersistent weak layer,\u201d it said in a notice of the event.",
      "The brothers were enjoying the snow in some meadows in Logan Canyon. They were climbing up to a higher meadow when the avalanche came down the hillside.",
      "\"I saw the snow ripple and knew that was an avalanche,\" said Braeden, who was ahead of his brother.",
      "\u201cI turned around to watch the slide hit Hunter and just watched him kind of get tumbled and buried and then lost sight of him,\u201d he said.",
      "Braeden activated a beacon that showed where his brother was. He found Hunter about 150 yards down from where he had last seen him.",
      "\u201cI just cleared the snow away from his head and got his helmet off so that he could start breathing again, and then just started digging his body out from there,\u201d Braeden said.",
      "Hunter had pulled out his phone to record his brother passing him on the slope, and then something caught his eye. It was the avalanche, with the snow breaking apart and beginning to tumble. It happened too fast to get out of the way, he said.",
      "\u201cIt just washed me down the mountain,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most violent thing I\u2019ve ever felt.\u201d",
      "He tumbled, and when the snow compacted, it felt like concrete, he recalled.",
      "\"Couldn't breathe, couldn't do anything,\" he said. \"I slammed into a rock or a tree.\"",
      "Hunter said he was bruised and is going to get his leg checked out for a possible fracture. He has a wife and a daughter, and his family has said his survival is a \"Christmas miracle,\" he said.",
      "The brothers were connected by a radio, but Hunter was immobile in the snow and could only listen but not respond. He heard their father and his brother talking about him and searching for him.",
      "\"I found him, I found him,\" came over the radio, Hunter recalled.",
      "\"There was just a sigh of relief when I felt him start digging,\" he said. He recalled \"being on my last breath\" and holding it as long as he could before he was rescued.",
      "Hunter credited his brother's quick thinking.",
      "The brothers always have beacons, which allow others to find them, as well as probes, shovels and airbag devices when they go into the backcountry in case of an avalanche, they said.",
      "\"It can happen at any moment and day, and it sure did happen to us,\" Braeden Hansen said.",
      "An average of 27 people die in avalanches in the United States every year, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center. Utah has the fourth-most recorded avalanche deaths since the winter of 1951 and 1952. Colorado, Alaska and Washington state are the top three.",
      "\"You hear so many tragic stories of people getting buried in avalanches and not making it out, so I feel very blessed and lucky,\" Hunter Hansen said."

    "story": [
      "A\u00a0man accused of attempting to assassinate\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump in South Florida won\u2019t be tried until September 2025, a federal judge ruled this week.",
      "Ryan Routh\u2019s trial will begin Sept. 8 instead of the previously scheduled Feb. 10 start date, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said in an order released on Monday.",
      "Routh, 58, a Hawaii resident, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Routh\u2019s attorneys\u00a0had asked the judge\u00a0to delay the trial until no earlier than next December, saying they needed more time to review the evidence against him and decide whether to mount an insanity defense.",
      "Routh owned 17 cellphones and numerous other electronic devices, and there are hundreds of hours of police body camera and surveillance videos that have been provided to the defense, Routh\u2019s attorneys argued during a hearing two weeks ago in Fort Pierce, Florida.",
      "In her order, Cannon said she wanted to err on the side of providing more time given the seriousness of the allegations, but that starting the trial no earlier than December would be an excessive amount. A September trial date didn\u2019t amount to an \u201cunreasonable delay,\u201d she said.",
      "The judge said that any insanity defense or any request related to Routh\u2019s mental competency must be made by early February. Any visit to the scene of the assassination attempt must be made by the end of February.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions.",
      "He was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate.",
      "Routh\u2019s charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence in the event of a conviction. Other charges include assaulting a federal officer and three firearms counts. He is being held without bail at the federal jail in Miami.",
      "Routh\u2019s arrest came two months after\u00a0Trump was shot and wounded\u00a0in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\u00a0The Secret Service acknowledged failings\u00a0leading up to that shooting but has said security worked as it should have to thwart the potential Florida attack."

      "Bird flu ripped through a Washington state wildlife sanctuary, killing 20 big cats, the center said in a Facebook post, calling the deaths a \"significant loss.\"",
      "The first cat got sick around Thanksgiving, Mark Mathews, director of the Wild Felid Advocacy Center in Shelton, told NBC affiliate KING of Seattle. By early December, the state had confirmed cases of bird flu in their cats.",
      "In a Facebook post Friday, the sanctuary announced the deaths. They include five African servals, four cougars, four bobcats, two Canada lynx and one each of the following: Bengal cat, Amur/Bengal tiger, African caracal, Geoffroy's cat and Eurasian lynx.",
      "\"This tragedy has deeply affected our team, and we are all grieving the loss of these incredible animals,\" the sanctuary said, asking the community for assistance.",
      "Mathews told KING that at the end of November, he had 37 cats and now he has 17.",
      "Some of the cats were featured on the sanctuary's website. Tabbi, an endangered half-Bengal and half-Amur\u00a0tiger, enjoyed playing in the water, the site states. Hannah, a cougar, was brought to the sanctuary as a cub from Wyoming after her mother was killed. The website described Hannah as \"sweet\" and said she liked \"sneaking up on volunteers.\" Mouse, a Geoffroy's cat and one of the smallest animals at the sanctuary, captured the hearts of everyone who met her, the website stated.",
      "Mathews told KING that the deaths were a living nightmare.",
      "\"Every day, it\u2019s just kind of you wake up and you think hopefully it\u2019s a bad dream, but it\u2019s not,\" he said.",
      "Health officials confirmed that more than half of the sanctuary's animals had contracted avian influenza, the Facebook post stated. The virus primarily spreads through infected bird secretions and droppings. Carnivorous mammals can contract it by coming into contact with infected birds or a contaminated environment.",
      "The sanctuary said cats are particularly vulnerable to bird flu and symptoms can progress rapidly, \"often resulting in death within 24 hours due to pneumonia-like conditions.\"",
      "To protect the other animals and prevent further spread, the sanctuary is under quarantine and will remain closed until further notice.",
      "The deaths come as zoos across the country have started taking precautionary measures. Five zoo animals died from bird flu outside Phoenix and one animal died at a zoo in Seattle."

      "The Center for Whale Research said a team of researchers was able to begin observation of the newborn girl Monday, giving the calf the alphanumeric designation J61. The center added that it was \"eager\" to conduct follow-up observations of the calf.",
      "Her mother is known as Tahlequah, designation number J35. Researchers assign the animals alphanumeric identifications and eventually nicknames to go with them.",
      "The Center for Whale Research expressed concern for the health of both J61 and her mother.",
      "\"Early life is always dangerous for new calves, with a very high mortality rate in the first year,\" the Center for Whale Research said Tuesday. \"J35 is an experienced mother, and we hope that she is able to keep J61 alive through these difficult early days.\"",
      "Tahlequah made international headlines in 2018 when she carried her dead newborn calf for 17 days, tugging on the heartstrings of humans everywhere. By the time she let the baby's carcass go, she had carried the calf across 1,000 miles on her head.",
      "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee had already signed an executive order that year establishing the Southern Resident Killer\u00a0Whale Task Force. The goal was to study ways to preserve and restore the local orca population.",

      "Orcas are considered an endangered population as they face a variety of threats, including entanglement in fishing nets, dwindling food supply, human interference and pollution of their environments. It\u2019s estimated there are only 50,000 killer whales globally.",
      "Contaminants in the water are a large concern for the killer whale population. Toxins from industrial chemicals don\u2019t break down, and they become concentrated in the food chain supply and are then stored in the orcas' fat, according to the Georgia Strait Alliance.",
      "Baby orcas are exposed to contaminants through their mothers' milk, which threatens their survival in their first year, the alliance said.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted that there are \"relatively high contaminant levels\" among the female Southern Resident whales and their offspring.",

These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

      "\"Home Alone\" director Chris Columbus nearly helmed another iconic Christmas movie, but he said that a \"surreal\" pair of meetings with star Chevy Chase made him quit the film.",
      "Columbus, 66, shared in an interview with Vanity Fair that he had originally signed on to direct \"Christmas Vacation,\" but he and Chase ended up getting along about as well as Clark Griswold and Uncle Lewis.",
      "\"I was signed on \u2026 and\u00a0then\u00a0I met Chevy Chase,\" Columbus said. \"Even given my situation at the time, where I desperately needed to make a film, I realized I couldn\u2019t work with the guy.",
      "\u201cTale as old as time!\u201d he continued. \u201cI was one of the many who couldn\u2019t work with him. And I called John and I said, \u2018This is really hard for me, but I can\u2019t do this movie with Chevy Chase.\u2019\u201d",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Chase for comment but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Columbus said he and legendary producer John Hughes had the same agent, which resulted in Columbus being sent the script for \"Christmas Vacation.\"",
      "The director had begun shooting exterior shots in Chicago for the 1989 movie when he had meetings with Chase that derailed his participation.",
      "\"My first meeting with him, I sat down with him,\" Columbus said. \"It was just the two of us. He\u00a0had\u00a0to know I was directing the movie. I talked about how I saw the movie, how I wanted to make the movie. He didn\u2019t say anything. I went through about a half hour of talking. He didn\u2019t say\u00a0a word.\u00a0And then he stops and he says\u2014and this makes no sense to any human being on the planet, but I\u2019m telling you. I probably have\u00a0never\u00a0told this story.",
      "\"Forty minutes into the meeting, he says, 'Wait a second. You\u2019re the director?' And I said, 'Yeah\u2026I\u2019m directing the film.' And he said to me the most surreal, bizarre thing. I still haven\u2019t been able to make any sense out of it. He said, 'Oh, I thought you were a drummer.' I said, 'Uhh, okay. Let\u2019s start talking about the film again.' After about 30 seconds, he said, 'I got to go.'\"",
      "Columbus said Chase met with Hughes, and they set up a second meeting at dinner with Hughes in attendance.",
      "\"I was basically nonexistent,\" Columbus said. \"It was Chevy and Hughes, and they talked about everything except 'Christmas Vacation.' We spent two hours together, and I left the dinner and I thought, 'There\u2019s no way I can make a movie with this guy. First of all, he\u2019s not engaged. He\u2019s treating me like s---. I don\u2019t need this. I\u2019d rather not work again. I\u2019d rather write.'\"",
      "The interaction has left Columbus puzzled nearly 40 years later.",
      "\"I guess that sense of humor was funny in the early \u201970s,\" he said. \"It\u2019s so surreal \u2026 Who says anything like that to anybody? It makes no sense. So to tell that story almost makes no sense, but it actually happened. I thought, 'This was how we\u2019re going to work together? I\u2019m going to be on set and he\u2019s not listening.'",
      "\"I called John and said, 'I can\u2019t do this,'\" he continued. \"'John, I need this job desperately, but I know I will not make a good movie with this guy and I will let you down.' And he said, 'I understand. Completely understand.'\"",
      "Jeremiah S. Chechik ended up directing \"Christmas Vacation,\" which was the third edition of the \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" series, all of them starring Chase.",
      "However, leaving \"Christmas Vacation\" led Columbus right to another holiday classic.",
      "\"The next weekend, I got\u00a0another\u00a0script from John\u2014and it\u2019s\u00a0'Home Alone,'\" he said. \"'Home Alone,' for me, was even more personal, a better script. And I thought, I can really do something with this, and I don\u2019t have to deal with Chevy Chase. That was it.\"",
      "Columbus went on to direct \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,\" \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and a pair of \"Harry Potter\" blockbuster movies. He is a producer on the upcoming vampire film \"Nosferatu,\" a remake of the 1922 silent classic of the same name."

      "How Marc Chalamet and Nicole Flender met",
      "The couple haven\u2019t publicly shared their love story or even details about their wedding, but their son once offered up a hint at how his parents came into each other\u2019s lives.",
      "When promoting his work in Wes Anderson\u2019s 2021 dramedy, \u201cThe French Dispatch,\u201d to RSNG.com, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet compared the movie's plot to his parents\u2019 early days together.",

Now, he works at the United Nations. My mother was a dancer when she met my father, and now she\u2019s working in real estate.\u201d",

      "\u201cI took them to see many different plays and musicals when they were growing up, and I think seeing certain performances influenced them,\u201d she told The Guardian. \u201cThe productions they\u2019ve seen, and even growing up in New York, has informed who they are today.\u201d",
      "Although she told the publication she \u201cplanted seeds, and our lifestyle really inspired those interests,\u201d she added that her kids \u201calways had control of their careers.\u201d",

      "Amazon MGM Studios' new film, \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d starring Ryan Destiny, tells the story of professional boxer Claressa Shields and how she overcame all odds to be one of the greatest female boxers alive.",
      "Though Shields accomplished much in her life, including becoming the \"first American boxer (male or female) ever to win gold in back-to-back Olympic Games,\" her road to victory was anything but easy.",
      "She grew up in poverty in Flint, Michigan to a mother who battled alcoholism and a father who was in jail during the early years of her life. At age 11, Shields started boxing with the help of her coach Jason Crutchfield, played by Brian Tyree Henry in the film, and that helped her deal with a lot of anger she had while growing up.",
      "\"I was molested and raped. But I channeled all the anger from that into boxing, and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m so successful at it,\" she told ESPN of her childhood. \"Boxing really helped with that. It calmed me down a lot and gave me discipline and structure.\"",
      "Thanks to boxing, Shields found a way out of her tumultuous home life and was able to create a name for herself in the sports world.",
      "Scroll below to learn all about Shields and how close the film, \"The Fire Inside,\" is to her real life.",
      "Who is Claressa \u2018T-Rex\u2019 Shields?",
      "Claressa Shields, aka T-Rex, is an American professional boxer from Flint, Michigan. In 2012, Shields headed to the Olympics at 17 years old and became the first American woman to win gold in boxing. Then, four years later at the 2016 Olympics, she did it again when she secured her second gold medal.",
      "Now at age 29, Shields holds the title as being the first American boxer ever to win gold in back-to-back Olympic Games.",
      "Not to mention, she's also a three-time undisputed champ. The only fight that Shields ever lost in her boxing career was against British World Champion Savannah Marshall just months before the 2012 Olympic Games, per the Olympics. However, she avenged herself in 2022 when the two went head-to-head in London for the middleweight champion title.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, Shields explained how she got her nickname \"T-Rex.\" She said she got the moniker as a child when she was \"very skinny\" and had \"short arms.\"",
      "What happened to Claressa Shields after the Olympics?",
      "Shields' life did not change much after she brought home a gold medal in boxing at the 2012 Olympics. That was the same year that women\u2019s boxing became an official Olympic sport.",
      "The self-proclaimed GWOAT (Greatest Woman of All Time) returned home to Flint, Michigan, with no endorsement deals whatsoever.",
      "In the movie, it's said that Shields was still living on her coach's couch after she had just made history at the Olympics.",
      "In an interview with NPR, Shields said that the public wasn't comfortable with her image and she was advised to stop boasting about how she likes to beat people up in her interviews.",
      "\u201cThey had this weird definition of what a strong woman was. For some reason, that definition was pretty, non-sweaty and not as muscular. And one, I\u2019m very pretty. I think I\u2019m fine! I\u2019m gorgeous!\u201d said with a grin.",
      "\u201cBut the fact of it is,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhen [I\u2019m] boxing, I look so strong and I\u2019m punching so hard and I\u2019m punching so fast, and [I] make people feel intimidated. I think that now people are starting to embrace that. The definition of a strong woman is\u00a0Laila Ali.\u00a0Lucia Rijker. Serena Williams. Claressa Shields.\u201d",
      "Shields told Entertainment Weekly that it was hard for her to see other people get brand deals who didn't win gold medals. She explained that it was also difficult to see brands flock to her friends like Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky and then offer her nothing.",
      "\"I felt like my gold medal weighed less than theirs. So to be a 17-year-old going through that and also be in Flint where everybody\u2019s saying, 'They played you, they dissed you, your gold medal didn\u2019t mean anything, you\u2019re not getting what you deserve' \u2014 to hear that for so many years and then go back and do it again was like, 'Oh, man,'\" she said.",
      "How accurate is \u2018The Fire Inside\u2019?",
      "\"The Fire Inside\" is loosely based on Shields' life so all events in the film are not exactly true. For instance, the movie portrays Shields as a fighter who wanted to win gold at the 2012 Olympics. However, in an interview with ESPN, she said she heavily contemplated whether or not she wanted to come in first.",
      "After she lost her fight against Marshall at the 2012 AIBA world championships in China, Shields said she noticed that the dynamic around her started to change from people believing in her to having doubts about her talents. She said they didn't change their tune until she made it all the way to the finals in the 2012 Olympics.",
      "\"I really hated the fake vibes. I felt it from my Olympic teammates, some of the coaches and from people at home also,\" she said.",
      "Shields couldn't help but think about what her life would be like if she took home silver instead of gold.",
      "\"As I was walking to the ring for my final fight at the Olympics, I was telling myself, 'If you get silver, maybe you won\u2019t have so many fakers and doubters and all this weird stuff around that you don\u2019t want. But if you get gold, it\u2019s going to be all of these people that are gonna come into your life. All these new cousins and all this new stuff,\" she said.",
      "\"I had to make a decision on whether or not I wanted to get gold or silver because the power was in my hands,\" Shields continued. \"Then right before I got into the ring, I took a deep breath and I was like, 'You know what? I\u2019m gonna go ahead and get this gold medal, and however my life changes after this, I\u2019m just going to accept it and deal with it the best way I can. There is no way I\u2019m about to miss out on this opportunity because I\u2019m scared of how many fake people will come around.\u201d",
      "Shields added that people still walk up to her to this day and tell her that they lost money betting against her in the finals.",
      "Was Claressa Shields involved in the \u2018The Fire Inside\u2019?",
      "Yes, Shields served as an executive producer in \"The Fire Inside\" and she told Entertainment Weekly that she had \"a lot of input\" in how the film was made.",
      "\"Before Barry (Jenkins) wrote the script, we met in person and talked for almost five hours. I let him speak first about what he thought my story was, and when he got done talking, I said, 'Well, you had a few key parts, but this is what I want to tell, what I want them to understand about me,\" she said. \"When he wrote his script a few months later and sent it to me, he got it just right.\"",
      "Shields also hailed Destiny's acting in the film and said she did a \"great job\" playing her in \"The Fire Inside.\"",

      "What is Claressa Shields doing now?",
      "After the 2016 Olympics, Shields went pro and became a five weight world champion. She reminded ESPN of her accolades when it left her off a list of \"trailblazing\" female athletes that aired on the channel.",

      "When asked why she wanted to do MMA, Shields told Yahoo Sports in 2021 that she felt like she \"never got her just due in boxing.\" At the time, Shields was a 12-time world champion. She is now a 15-time world champ.",

Would that make me a household name? Or would that make me a millionaire?'\" she said. \"And the truth is no. It wouldn't open up any more doors to me than what has already been opened.\"",
      "\"I would have to keep fighting this war of equal pay and equal opportunity and getting women equal fight time,\" she continued. \"It just got to a place where I was like, you know what, I've been working so hard and boxing for so many years that if I'm going to work hard at something then at least let me reap what I sow.\""

    "story": [
      "There\u2019s one dessert that\u2019s the talk of Tinseltown around the holidays: the so-called \u201cTom Cruise cake.\u201d",
      "The white chocolate coconut Bundt cake from the family-owned Doan\u2019s Bakery in Woodland Hills, California got its nickname because the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d star famously gifts the dessert to his Hollywood friends at the end of every year.",
      "In 2018, Cruise said on \u201cThe Late Late Show with James Corden\u201c that he likes to send cakes to people because he doesn\u2019t consume sugar while training.",
      "So, instead of treating himself during the holidays, he treats his costars and colleagues to the coconut cake with chunks of white chocolate covered in cream cheese frosting and toasted coconut shavings.",
      "Who has received the Tom Cruise cake?",
      "Cruise\u2019s gift list reads like an awards show roll call: Renee Zellweger, Graham Norton, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Henry Cavill, Kirsten Dunst, Cobie Smulders, Jimmy Fallon, Jon Hamm and Angela Bassett are just a small selection of folks who have spoken publicly about receiving the cake.",
      "Brooke Shields famously spoke about being removed from the list for reasons unknown to her, and Tom Hanks said his ideal \u201clast meal\u201d would include the cake.",
      "This year is no different: On Dec. 13, Cruise\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d costar Glen Powell shared a photo of the cake on his Instagram story, writing, \u201cThe Cruise Cake has arrived.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 19, Mindy Kaling shared a photo of the cake on her Instagram story with the caption \u201cIykyk\u201d (an abbreviation for the phrase \u201cIf you know, you know\u201d).",
      "Singer Victoria Canal also got a Cruise cake this year and tried a bite of it on Instagram.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rich,\u201d Canal says in the video. \u201cLike Tom Cruise.\u201d",
      "The pastry is so famous, it was immortalized in HBO comedy series \u201cHacks.\u201d\u00a0 In the Season 3 premiere, fictional superstar comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) is lucky enough to be sent one of the cakes, which is immediately clocked by her protege Ava (Hannah Einbinder).",
      "Where does the Tom Cruise cake come from?",
      "The cake was invented by Karen Doan, who established Doan\u2019s Bakery in 1983 by baking desserts for restaurants, coffee houses, caterers and private events. According to the bakery\u2019s website, 25 years ago, Karen, her son Eric and his wife Carrie opened the bakery to the public. Karen died in 2023, and Eric now runs the bakery.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing seeing it go from my grandma renting out kitchens, making wholesale cakes for her friend\u2019s restaurant in \u201883 to now,\u201d Alexis Doan, Eric\u2019s daughter, tells TODAY.com. Alexis acts as the store manager and assists during the busy holiday season.",
      "Alexis says that Cruise orders around 300 to 400 cakes from the bakery every year, adding that the bakery doesn\u2019t ship them out, so they\u2019re unaware who in Hollywood is actually receiving them.",
      "How to get the cake for yourself",
      "Doan\u2019s Bakery also sells the dessert through Goldbelly for $129.95 including shipping. Alexis says if you pick it up in person, the cake, which has 12 to 16 servings, costs $59.",
      "The bakery also sells a medium size that serves six to eight people for $39 and an individual portion for $9.",
      "Although there\u2019s a markup on Goldbelly, it\u2019s proven super popular there and is sold out through late-February. The bakery ships out roughly 50 cakes per day, five days a week through the online marketplace.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s not including storefront, which totally varies, depending on the holiday,\u201d Alexis says.",
      "Goldbelly says it\u2019s been working with Doan\u2019s for more than five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most loved cakes on our site and we\u2019re thrilled to bring the magic of their white chocolate coconut cake to the world,\u201d Joe Ariel, founder and CEO of Goldbelly, tells TODAY.com. \u201cNow you no longer need to be a celebrity to order or gift someone the famous \u2018Tom Cruise Cake.\u2019\u201d",
      "If you want a celebrity coconut cake and can\u2019t wait until after Valentine\u2019s Day, Ina Garten has a get-it-sooner alternative on Goldbelly. Her coconut layer cake has a hint of almond and is layered with cream cheese icing and coated in shredded coconut, and will arrive at your door before the ball drops, for $99.95.",
      "Why does Tom Cruise love this cake?",
      "In a 2021 interview with Spectrum News, Karen recounts the story of how Cruise came to order so many cakes from their family-run business. As the story goes, Diane Keaton introduced the cake to Katie Holmes during the filming of \u201cMad Money\u201d in 2008. Holmes was married to Cruise at the time.",
      "\u201cSo when Tom and Katie had a big party at their new home in Beverly Hills, we did all the cakes,\u201d Karen said. \u201cThey loved it.\u201d",
      "Ever since then, Cruise has given the cake out every year \u2014 and word gets around.",
      "\u201cPeople do call it that,\u201d Alexis says, adding that while people come in asking for the Tom Cruise cake, they take special care to not advertise it that way. \u201cWe can\u2019t control what they call it, but out of respect for him, we just call it the White Chocolate Coconut Cake. We don\u2019t want to use him as publicity.\u201d",
      "How does it taste?",
      "On Dec. 13, the TODAY anchors tried the iconic cake for themselves. During PopStart, TODAY cohost Carson Daly served up the treat, which is known to be moist, buttery and coconutty, to the group.",
      "\u201cHow did you get this?\u201d Al Roker asked Carson, who replied that he got the cake from Goldbelly \u2014 not from Cruise (this year, at least).",
      "\u201cMmm,\u201d Hoda Kotb says while taking multiple bites of cake. \u201cI love it. Wow.\u201d",
      "The hosts all seemed to enjoy their slices, and Al said, \u201cThat\u2019s good cake.\u201d"

      "Their story is loosely told in \u201cLos Frikis,\u201d or \u201cThe Freaks,\u201d a drama in theaters Dec. 25, starring Adria Arjona, H\u00e9ctor Medina and\u00a0newcomer Eros de la Puente. Written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, creators of \u201cThe Peanut Butter Falcon,\u201d the Spanish-language film begins with the following message:",
      "\u201cIn 1961, Fidel Castro outlawed rock music in Cuba. For decades, only the boldest performers played \u2018the music of the enemy\u2019 in secret. The most extreme members of this movement became known as Los Frikis.\u201d",
      "Inspired by true events, \u201cLos Frikis\u201d tells the coming-of-age story of Gustavo (de la Puente), who idolizes his older brother Paco (Medina) and his rock music-loving friends. Poor and starving during a period of scarcity in Cuba, Paco and his friends inject themselves with HIV so they can be sent to a government-run sanitarium where they can have full meals, freedom and listen to and play rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.",
      "\u201c(There) they experience freedom and joy and a full belly for the first time in their lifetime,\u201d Arjona tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s a joyful, beautiful ride of these two brothers coming together. It\u2019s a coming-of-age story. It\u2019s funny, and it\u2019s incredibly, incredibly heartbreaking as well.\u201d",
      "Miller, along with producer Phil Lord and actors Adria Arjona, H\u00e9ctor Medina and\u00a0Eros de la Puente, break down the incredible story of resilience and endurance told in \u201cLos Frikis.\u201d",
      "A harrowing time in Cuba",
      "In 1989, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba\u2019s economy took a turn for the worse. The country entered its decadeslong depression known as the \u201cSpecial Period,\u201d when food and fuel shortages affected the population.",
      "\u201cLos Frikis\u201d shows the struggles that many people faced at that time and the extreme measures they took to survive. Early on there's a scene where Paco makes his brother catch and kill a cat so they can eat it. Gustavo doesn\u2019t have the stomach to do it.",
      "\u201cYou have to learn how to take care of yourself, OK!\u201d Paco sternly tells his brother. \u201cWake up! We live in Cuba!\u201d",
      "A 1989 New York Times article wrote about \u201cstarvation in Cuba,\u201d where it said \u201ccats and dogs there, and even iguanas and snakes, have been eaten.\u201d",
      "At the same time, as the AIDS epidemic spread in the '80s, HIV testing began in Cuba in 1986, according to The New York Times. Cuba took strict measures to combat the spread by frequently testing people for HIV and offering free basic health care, as well as forcing people who tested positive to quarantine in the sanitariums.",
      "The self-infected Frikis knew that if they were sent to the sanitariums they would be provided with food, shelter and the freedom to listen and play their music.",
      "\u201cThe thing that we were trying to do was make sure that it wasn\u2019t sensationalizing (people injecting themselves with HIV) and presenting what was happening in a matter of fact, letting the story tell you what was going on without trying to push it,\u201d producer Chris Miller tells TODAY.com. \u201cBecause what really happened is so outrageous, you don\u2019t need to do anything extra to make it seem outrageous. So it was really about trying to underplay it as much as possible.\u201d",
      "While the sanitariums kept people infected with the disease away from their families, people formed lifelong friendships and the places kept the spread to a minimum.",
      "According to a 2007 study, Cuba had one of the world\u2019s smallest HIV epidemics. Its infection rate was 0.1 %, the lowest HIV prevalence in the Caribbean, per the study. In 2015, Cuba became the first country to receive validation from the World Health Organization that it had eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis.",
      "Who were 'Los Frikis'?",
      "Los Frikis were a group of punk rockers who rejected communist Cuba, loved rock music (which was banned by Fidel Castro) and the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll style. They also were outcasts, many of whom were of the LGBTQ community.",
      "Niurka Fuentes' late husband, Papo La Bala, was one of the first Frikis, and injected himself with the virus. She told Vice in 2017, \u201cHe knew that he would meet other people like him in there, the police would leave him alone, and he would be able to live his life in peace.\u201d",
      "Papo La Bala was quoted as saying, per the metal music magazine Metal Hammer, \u201cI gave myself AIDS \u2014 and many others like me \u2014 because we were the most persecuted class in the entire country. The police fell hardest on us. All the laws were against us. It was a level of discrimination completely without democracy.\u201d",
      "Another Friki, Yoandra Cardoso, also told Vice, \u201cYou could hear rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and\u00a0heavy metal coming from every house. When the sanatorium first opened, it was 100\u00a0percent Frikis \u2026 we were all here together.\u201d",
      "At the time, there wasn\u2019t much information about HIV and AIDS. Cuba would seek cures and treatment. Patients at sanitariums could volunteer to be the test subjects, which is depicted in \u201cLos Frikis.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it was very important for this movie to make sure that people know how desperate you actually have to be in order to make that choice,\u201d de la Puente, who was born in Cuba, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Growing up in Cuba, Medina was very aware of the Frikis and even knew some of them.",
      "\u201cI spoke with a drummer who was in a band in Cuba,\u201d the 35-year-old says in Spanish about his research. \u201cHe told me about his friendships, that period, how they would try to find phone cords to use as guitar strings ... It was very interesting how they would find ways to play music.\u201d",
      "He also spoke with a medical professional who worked at Los Cocos, a sanitarium southwest of Havana, who recalled seeing his patient-turned-friends die of AIDS.",
      "The message behind 'Los Frikis'",
      "Producer Phil Lord wanted the movie to speak of the current moment but go beyond politics.",
      "\u201cWe wanted it to be something universal about how you find your freedom, who you find it with, how you stay together under adversity, how families carry on in adverse circumstances,\u201d the Cuban American filmmaker tells TODAY.com. \u201c(It\u2019s) the story of these two brothers... it was going to be funny and warm, even though, ostensibly, the topic is devastating.\u201d",
      "Producer Chris Miller adds that the movie is about \u201cfinding hope in a hopeless situation.\u201d",
      "For the actors, de la Puente says that what resonates with audiences is \u201cel esp\u00edritu Friki.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 17:03:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Martin Short and Melissa McCarthy teamed up for an aggressive approach to getting the last parking spot during a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch with Mikey Day and Chloe Fineman.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d brought back a fan favorite sketch, this time with a holiday twist.",
      "Martin Short hosted the late night sketch comedy show on Dec. 21 alongside musical guest, Hozier. The episode featured the sketch \u201cParking Lot Altercation,\u201d which served as a callback to when Quinta Brunson hosted in April 2023.",
      "The \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d star and creator appeared in a similar sketch called \u201cTraffic Altercation,\u201d wherein she and Mikey Day engaged in some animated and often inappropriate gesturing while they were stuck in a traffic jam on the highway.",
      "This time, Short competed with Day for a parking lot spot at a mall on the afternoon of Christmas Eve.",
      "At the beginning of their exchange, the men try to reasonably communicate their ownership over the spot, with Day insisting that the spot was his with some simple gesturing, while Short claimed that his blinker was on, as conveyed by his aggressive blinking.",
      "Tensions escalated from there, with Day claiming that he reached the spot first, to which Short accused him of being blind. The sketch continued to take dark and inappropriate turns as their argument over the parking spot continued without resolution. At one point, Day\u2019s daughter, portrayed by Chloe Fineman, got involved, albeit with some NSFW gestures.",
      "Day accused Short of being a liar after sharing that he was handicapped due to his high blood pressure, using his hand to gesture his nose growing \u00e0 la Pinocchio. Short responded by claiming he would never lie because he was a \u201csuper Christian\u201d as represented by him doing his best Superman stance and then holding his arms out as if he were on the cross.",
      "Eventually, Short said that if Day wouldn\u2019t listen to him, then maybe he would listen to his wife, portrayed by Melissa McCarthy. Though Day initially didn\u2019t see Short\u2019s wife, McCarthy came in hot on the scene and started to bang on the passenger side window.",
      "\u201cDrive away right now or I will kill you, now,\u201d she threatened the father-daughter duo. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make your dumb daughter watch.\u201d",
      "After the threats intensified, McCarthy paused to take a sip of an iced coffee before promptly spitting it back out onto the window.",
      "Day and Fineman could barely keep it together as McCarthy used her chest to wipe off the beverage from the window, pausing every few seconds to glare at them before pressing her chest against the window again. At one point, she even licked a line clean off the window so she could get a better look at the duo before creeping away.",
      "That was the final straw in the argument as Day ultimately surrendered the spot to Short who seemed overjoyed by the win.",
      "McCarthy wasn\u2019t the only celebrity cameo during last night\u2019s episode.",
      "The show kicked-off with a star-studded cold open that saw Short being inducted into the Five-Timers Club.",
      "The sketch featured several members of the club, including Tom Hanks, Paul Rudd, Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Wiig, Emma Stone, and John Mulaney.",
      "Though not a member of the club, Jimmy Fallon presented Short with his honorary purple velvet jacket and Colin Jost tried to enter with his wife, Johansson, but she ditched him for the shindig and shut the door in his face.",
      "Rudd appeared in several sketches throughout the night, including during the \u201cS\u00e1bado Gigante Christmas Special\u201d alongside Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez and as himself during the \u201cChristmas Airport Parade.\u201d McCarthy played a gate agent in the sketch, while Hanks appeared not at himself but as Captain Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger, a nod to the 2016 film \u201cSully.\u201d"

It\u2019s as horrifying as it is destructive.\u201d",

      "Why fans believe there\u2019s drama between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively",
      "Online, the volume of a single question surrounding the \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d rollout has gone steadily up in the week leading up to the release: Why hasn\u2019t star and director Baldoni been pictured with the rest of the cast?",
      "People on social media have dissected cast appearances and events. At the New York movie premiere Aug. 6, Lively was photographed with an ensemble, including her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and his \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d co-star Hugh Jackman. She also posed with \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d co-stars Brandon Sklenar and Jenny Slate. Baldoni appeared only with his wife, Emily Baldoni, or alone.",
      "Fans also noticed that Lively and Hoover do not follow Baldoni on Instagram, but they follow each other and other cast members like Sklenar and Slate.",
      "Since then, fans have began to speculate about possible tension between Baldoni and Lively. Baldoni did not partake in many group engagements with the cast to promote the film, often doing interviews solo, while Lively was paired with one or more other cast members. Fans on TikTok and YouTube were quick to note Baldoni\u2019s noticeable absence from Vanity Fair\u2019s interview with Lively and five other central actors in the film.",
      "This is part of a trend of fans close-reading press tours by analyzing interviews, red carpet interactions, body language and more for insight into cast dynamics. \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d press tour in 2023, for example, was clouded by rumors of a rift between star Taraji P. Henson and executive producer Oprah Winfrey, which they both denied. \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling,\u201d from 2022, was similarly overshadowed by a rumored feud between the cast and the relationship between a star (Harry Styles) and director (Olivia Wilde).",
      "What have \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 cast members said about an alleged feud?",
      "On Aug. 20, Sklenar became the first cast member to address any perceived iciness.",
      "\u201cColleen and the women of this cast stand for hope, perseverance, and for women choosing a better life for themselves,\u201d he wrote on Instagram in part. \u201cVilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strong in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about. It is, in fact, the opposite of the point. What may or may not have happened behind the scenes does not and hopefully should not detract from what our intentions were in making this film. It\u2019s been disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected online.\u201d",
      "Lively and Baldoni have not commented, though Baldoni has spoken highly about Lively and the contributions she made on the film.",
      "During a TODAY appearance Aug. 8, Baldoni said of the movie star: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know how smart and creative she really is. I think she\u2019s best known as an actress and of course she\u2019s a fashion icon, but she\u2019s so much more than that. She\u2019s dynamic, creative. She had her hands in every part of this production and everything she touched, she made better.\u201d",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com that took place after his broadcast appearance, Baldoni spoke to the extent of Lively impact on the movie, along with her husband\u2019s.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t summarize Blake\u2019s contribution in a sentence, because her energy and imprint is all over the movie and really, really made the film better, and from beginning to end,\u201d he said. \u201cRyan (Reynolds) was so generous ... he\u2019s a creative genius, that guy. So, you know, his gift is levity, and her gift is levity.\u201d",
      "Baldoni had also suggested Lively direct the sequel to \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there are better people for that one,\u201d Baldoni told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d when asked if he\u2019d be interested in heading the next movie. \u201cI think Blake Lively is ready to direct. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d",
      "As for Lively, she has not mentioned Baldoni in interviews, though she has been open about her creative touches seen in \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d In an interview with Hits Radio UK on Aug. 11, said she and people involved in the film disagreed over featuring Lana Del Ray\u2019s song \u201cCherry.\u201d Lively was strongly for it, while others were against it \u2014 though she added, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be talking about this.\u201d",
      "Lively on TODAY said she sourced her character Lily\u2019s clothes from her own wardrobe, as well from her friend Gigi Hadid\u2019s and Reynolds\u2019. And in an interview with E! News on the red carpet, Lively revealed her husband wrote the rooftop scene, where Ryle and Lily first meet.",
      "Why did Blake Lively sue Justin Baldoni?",
      "In December 2024, over four months after \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d premiered, Lively filed a complaint against Baldoni for sexual harassment.",
      "Lively claimed in her complaint, which was obtained by TODAY.com, that she experienced sexual harassment in addition to retaliation, breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and more.",
      "In the complaint, Baldoni and Jamey Heath, the CEO of Wayfarer Studios and producer on the film, were said to have engaged in \u201cinappropriate and unwelcome behavior\u201d toward Lively and other individuals on the set of the film.",
      "These claims included ignoring industry safeguards for filming intimate scenes, adding in \u201cgratuitous sexual content,\u201d discussing personal sexual experiences, and objectifying women, including Lively.",
      "The complaint also noted that Baldoni and his team proceeded to \u201cformulate a retaliatory plan\u201d due to knowledge the Wayfarer Studios had of the HR complaints made against the actor and Heath\u2019s behavior. It also stated that Baldoni retaliated because the complaints \u201cthreatened his feminist brand.\u201d",
      "Lively claimed in her complaint that due to an \u201cincrease in negative media articles and social media coverage,\u201d she, her family and her businesses all \u201csuffered\u201d and were \u201csubstantially harmed\u201d by Wayfarer Studios\u2019 actions.",
      "\u201cThe emotional impact on Ms. Lively has been extreme, not only affecting her, but her family, including her husband and four children,\u201d the complaint read in part. \u201cThere are days when she has struggled to get out of bed, and she frequently chooses not to venture outside in public.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, responded to the complaint in a statement to TODAY.com, sharing that they were \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Does \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 romanticize abuse?",
      "While current chatter around \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d surrounds the cast, the story itself has generated controversy. Previously, discourse revolved around its delivery of a heavy subject matter.",
      "Hoover has shared publicly that the story was inspired by her mom, who left her abusive husband (and Hoover\u2019s biological father) when Hoover was 2.",
      "A common criticism of the book was that it romanticized abuse.\u00a0An op-ed published to a domestic shelters non-profit said the BookTok favorite \u201cfeeds into the very structures of toxic masculinity that it purports to combat\u201d by \u201cromanticizing red flags\u201d and glorifies a \u201ccharismatic-but-dangerous man.\u201d",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Baldoni said he and screenwriter Christy Hall made a concerted effort to take criticism into account \u201cfrom the very beginning.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe talked about the criticism. We talked about why that happened. We talked about what we can do to protect the movie from that criticism, and how we can make sure that we inject as much truth into it, so that people can be seen and never feel like their stories are being exploited,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said he \u201ccompletely understands\u201d the criticism.",
      "\u201cI want to validate and support anybody and everybody who\u2019s come out against the book, because the last thing we need is to romanticize something that is such a real experience for so many people\u201d",
      "Baldoni took input from the domestic violence organization No More while making the film and also attended a support group for perpetrators to try to better understand their psychology.",
      "As a result of their effort, the movie changes one of the most controversial plot points from the book: the end of Lily and Ryle\u2019s relationship.",
      "In the book, although Lily leaves Ryle, he stays part of their daughter\u2019s life and watches her unsupervised for days on end. In the movie, Ryle isn\u2019t seen on screen after their daughter is born at the hospital.",
      "Baldoni told The Wrap the script\u2019s original draft had a scene that involved Ryle dropping off their child and having a short conversation with Lily.",
      "\u201cIt was written in a way that showed that they\u2019ve overcome a lot over the last two years. And I wasn\u2019t fully comfortable with it.\u201d",
      "Does the movie\u2019s marketing match its tone?",
      "Some are saying the movie\u2019s packaging is discordant with its subject matter.",
      "\u201cIf you just watch the trailer for this movie \u2026 it looks like a romance,\u201d as pop culture TikToker Jess Spoll said.",
      "The poster sees Lily smiling and surrounded by flowers. The original cover art for the movie took on a different tone. In it, Lily and Ryle stand close together in an embrace. Lily\u2019s face is in focus and she appears to wear an ambiguous impression.",
      "A post shared by It Ends With Us (@itendswithusmovie)",
      "Readers of the book often experienced a similar surprise, like this TikTok points to: \u201cReading \u2018It Ends with Us\u2019 thinking it is a cute romance,\u201d the text reads \u2014 before things change, and the true nature of Lily and Ryle\u2019s relationship emerges.",
      "Since the film's release, people started taking issue with Lively\u2019s promotion of the film.",
      "\u201cJustin is promoting the movie as it is, which is about DV (domestic violence), it\u2019s a very heavy topic, it\u2019s what the book focuses on,\u201d Meredith Mansfield says in a now-viral TikTok video. \u201cWhereas Blake and everybody else are promoting it like a rom-com and that\u2019s rubbing a lot of people the wrong way.\u201d",
      "Mansfield cited an interview with Lively where she suggested people \u201cgrab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see\u201d the film.",
      "In another viral video, TikToker Ashley Paige, who goes by @livingsingle and says she\u2019s a survivor of domestic abuse, addressed Lively in a 5-minute-long video.",
      "\u201cIn this video, you represented us... it\u2019s your job, right?\u201d she said, going on to cite domestic violence statistics in the United States.",
      "\u201cAnd you have the audacity to show up to the premiere and tell your audience and have influencers promote it like it\u2019s the sequel to \u2018Barbie,\u2019\u201d Paige said. \u201cYou could\u2019ve gone about this so differently, in such a respectful, tactful, gentle, understanding, advocacy-bringing awareness manner.\u201d",
      "Paige seemed to be responding, at least in part, to an Aug. 9 interview Lively did with the BBC where she said that \u201cwhat\u2019s important about the film\u201d is that her character Lily is \u201cnot just a victim.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile those are huge things to be, she\u2019s not defined by something that someone else did to her or an event that happened to her, even if it\u2019s multiple events,\u201d Lively said. \u201cShe defines herself and I think that\u2019s deeply empowering to remind people that no one else can define you. No experience can define you, you define you.\u201d",
      "How have cast members reacted to marketing criticism?",
      "Sklenar also addressed criticism surrounding promotion of the movie in his Aug. 20 Instagram post:",
      "\u201cTrust me when I tell you, there isn\u2019t a single person involved in the making of this film that was not aware of the responsibility we had in making this. A responsibility to all the women who have experienced generational trauma \u2014 domestic abuse \u2014 or struggle with looking in the mirror and loving who they see. This movie is a harsh reality check for the men who need to get their s\u2014 together and take responsibility for themselves and their actions.\u201d",
      "Lively nor Baldoni have spoken out directly, though Lively on her Instagram story Aug. 13 thanked viewers for seeing the movie and \u201cgetting a message so important out there to the masses.\u201d",
      "In a second post on her Instagram story that same day, she shared the link and phone number to the National Domestic Violence Hotline with the following caption:",
      "\u201c1 in 4 women aged 18 and older in the US alone have been the victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. Intimate partner violence affects all genders, including more than 12 million people every year in the United States.\u201d",
      "What happened with the coloring book?",
      "\ufeffIn 2023, Hoover announced \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d was becoming a coloring book, a move that was immediately criticized by fans who said the medium didn\u2019t fit the tone. A day later, plans for the book were canceled, and Hoover acknowledged fan feedback.",
      "\u201cThe coloring book was developed with Lily\u2019s strength in mind, but I can absolutely see how this was tone-deaf,\u201d Hoover wrote in part.",
      "Merch related to the book has continued, however. In April 2024, Hoover released a line of long-lasting nail polish and press-ons with Olive and June. Colors are named after the book\u2019s characters, as well as other books of hers (though there isn\u2019t a Ryle nail polish).",
      "Lively also launched in tandem with the movie\u2019s release a new product: her hair care line at Target.",
      "The characters\u2019 ages",
      "When the casting was announced in 2023, fans of the book immediately took issue with Lively and Baldoni portraying the main characters.",
      "At 36, Lively is older than the book\u2019s version of Lily, who is written to be 23. Ryle is about 30.",
      "Hoover told TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager in 2023 that she made a \u201cmistake\u201d with the characters\u2019 ages in the book and that both should be older, especially given Ryle is a neurosurgeon.",
      "\u201cAs an author, we make mistakes,\u201d she explained in her interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no 28-year-old neurosurgeons, you know? You go to school for 15 years. And so to make corrections to what I messed up in the book, we aged the characters up somewhat.\u201d"

      "BETHLEHEM, West Bank \u2014 In the little town of Bethlehem, Christmas this year is barely a whisper.",
      "Palestinian scouts paraded through the streets but without their traditional instruments of drums, horns and bagpipes. There was no jubilant countdown to the lighting of the Christmas tree in the main square. In fact, there is no Christmas tree at all.",
      "Bethlehem is facing its second bleak Christmas since the outbreak of the war in Gaza \u2014 leaving faith leaders and residents grappling with how to mark the festive holiday while fellow Palestinians continue to be killed.",
      "\u201cBethlehem is the capital of Christmas. It\u2019s supposed to be the best time of the year. None of that is happening because we\u2019re mourning,\u201d Rev. Munther Isaac, the pastor of Bethlehem\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church, told NBC News.",
      "Next to the altar where Isaac delivers sermons is an unusual Nativity scene: For the second Christmas in a row, the baby Jesus is wrapped in a keffiyeh, the traditional Palestinian scarf, and nestled on a pile of rubble. It serves as a reminder of the thousands of Palestinian children killed in Israeli strikes during the war, Isaac said. \u201cWe see Jesus in every child pulled from under the rubble in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Aside from the suffering in Gaza, Bethlehem faces its own challenges.",
      "Its economy is heavily dependent on tourism but few foreign visitors are coming to the city in the occupied West Bank amid the war sparked by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. That is compounding economic misery that began with the Covid pandemic, which also devastated the tourism industry.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a desert,\u201d said Rony Tabash, whose family has run a gift store near the Church of the Nativity for nearly a century. \u201cThere are no pilgrims, there are no tourists.\u201d At the worst points, he said, he had gone two months without making a single sale.",
      "Meanwhile, an Israeli-built wall partially encircles Bethlehem, cutting it off from Jerusalem and stifling homebuilding and urban growth. Israel says the wall is a necessary security measure to stop suicide bombings. But in 2004, the International Court of Justice determined it was illegal under international law.",
      "The hardship means many young people are leaving Bethlehem and moving abroad in search of a better future \u2014 raising fears that the Christian community in the city where the faith was born will dwindle and might one day disappear.",
      "\u201cWe are very, very concerned,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cThis is beyond the dangerous point.\u201d",
      "Life is no easier for elderly Christians. At the home of 79-year-old Nuha Tarazi, her landline phone beeps harshly as an attempted call to her relatives in Gaza once again fails to connect.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t put up the Christmas tree,\u201d the widowed grandmother said. \u201cI would not feel well if I did that while they\u2019re suffering there.\u201d",
      "Tarazi was born in Gaza City but has lived in Bethlehem for nearly 40 years. Four of her siblings were still alive in the Strip when the war broke out more than a year ago. But she said one of her sisters had been killed in an Israeli strike and a brother had died of untreated kidney disease as Gaza\u2019s health care system collapsed.",
      "Her two surviving siblings \u2014 sister, Samhiaa Azzam, and brother, Atallah Tarazi \u2014 are among hundreds of Christians sheltering at the Holy Family, a Catholic church in the ruins of Gaza City. Families fall asleep to the thump of nearby airstrikes and the constant whine of an Israeli drone overhead.",
      "\u201cWe constantly ask God to protect us and safeguard us from all evil,\u201d said Atallah, 77, a retired surgeon who once traveled the world but now rarely leaves the church compound and sleeps in a cot in a crowded storage room.",
      "During a visit in Gaza by NBC News, Samhiaa and Atallah placed a call to their sister Nuha in Bethlehem. This time the call connected.",
      "\u201cHappy New Year, may you be in peace,\u201d Samhiaa, 74, told her sister over the crackly line, urging her to celebrate Christmas despite everything. \u201cMy greetings to everyone, rejoice as much as you can. Rejoice.\u201d"

      "Sharaa, who has dropped his nom de guerre of Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has been pushing this line in meetings with Western diplomats and the media since rebel forces, led by his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, toppled the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. As his new administration takes charge, he has also called for the United States and other countries to drop sanctions against Syria.",
      "\u201cNow, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime,\u201d Sharaa, dressed in a smart suit and a white shirt, told the BBC in an interview earlier this week, having abandoned the camouflage military fatigues and turban he once wore as a jihadist leader.",
      "\u201cThe victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,\u201d he added.",

I think those are big questions,\" added Stroul, who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:48:24 GMT",
    "summary": "When a Saudi Arabian national was accused of ramming a car into a German Christmas market, members of the frequently anti-Muslim European far right said it proved their point.",
    "story": [
      "When a Saudi Arabian national was accused of ramming a car into a German Christmas market, members of the frequently anti-Muslim European far right said it proved their point. The deadly incident in Magdeburg was another example of Islamist terrorism, they said \u2014 and a result of the mass immigration they so vehemently oppose.",
      "Except it wasn\u2019t that simple.",
      "The suspect, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, 50, was in fact scathingly critical of Islam and immigration, according to his past posts on X. He aligned himself with the far-right, anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is endorsed by Musk and monitored by German intelligence agencies for suspected extremism. While authorities say the motive is not yet clear, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the suspect \u201cwas obviously Islamophobic.\u201d",
      "Al-Abdulmohsen\u2019s complex worldview, in which he criticized the Saudi Arabian government but also Germany\u2019s alleged failure to protect Saudi immigrants from the Middle Eastern kingdom\u2019s repression, has muddied attempts to use his alleged killing of five people and injuring 200 others as an anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim cautionary tale. It comes at a time when immigration is the most polarizing issue in Europe, where far-right parties are surging on a wave of discontent, and immigrants are blamed for job scarcity, housing shortages and cultural changes.",
      "There has been \u201czero\u201d contrition from those on the right who sought to capitalize on the incident, said Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group focused on radical ideologies.",
      "Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, who has backed far-right figures in Europe, wrote on X that the \u201clegacy media lies again\u201d when news outlets, including NBC News, reported that officials described the suspect as Islamophobic.",
      "Other figures who were quick to interpret the attack have since kept quiet.",
      "\u201cThey despise our values,\u201d Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders posted Friday on X. \u201cThis is our land, our freedom, our life. And we\u2019ll defend it and never surrender.\u201d",
      "However, it later emerged that the suspect was a fan of Wilders, having previously called him \u201ca true hero\u201d on X. Wilders has not posted about it since, as of 7 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, meanwhile, did continue to comment but instead focused on the suspect\u2019s immigrant background rather than his political and religious beliefs. On Monday night during a rally in Magdeburg\u2019s cathedral square she called for change \u201cso we can finally live once again in security,\u201d Reuters reported.\u00a0 Members of the crowd shouted \u201cdeport them\u201d punctuated her speech.",
      "Al-Abdulmohsen entered Germany in 2006 \u2014 almost a decade before then-Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201copen-door policy\u201d that saw 1 million asylum-seekers enter the country and, critics say, foment much of the political disquiet experienced today.",
      "\u201cWhen everyone, including myself, thought this was an Islamic State attack, these accounts were all posting Islamophobic stuff, then a couple of hours later, when it turned out this guy is Islamophobic himself, these right-wing social media feeds seamlessly switched to migration,\u201d Schindler said.",
      "Other organizations the suspect previously interacted with are now trying to distance themselves.",
      "An ultra-conservative American blog called the RAIR Foundation USA interviewed al-Abdulmohsen just eight days beforehand, profiling him as a former Muslim whistleblower \u201cexposing\u201d Germany\u2019s attempts to \u201cIslamize the West.\u201d",
      "After the attack, the foundation updated its interview page.",
      "\u201cIf these reports are accurate, it appears we and other media outlets \u2026 were misled regarding his true intentions,\u201d it stated.",
      "Meanwhile, far-right X account Radio Genoa shared a video of his arrest and described him as an \u201cArab Islamic terrorist.\u201d This, despite some commenters noting that al-Abdulmohsen himself had regularly reposted Radio Genoa\u2019s own racially charged criticisms of Islam and immigration.",
      "Musk\u2019s comment deriding the media\u2019s reporting of the suspect\u2019s past and beliefs came just hours after the South African-born billionaire doubled down on his support for the AfD party. This support comes amid a series of other positive comments from Musk boosting parties on the populist and nationalist right, having successfully backed President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s win in the United States last month.",
      "It\u2019s not only this that\u2019s alarming more mainstream European officials, but also what they see as a lack of regulation on Musk\u2019s X platform, which the suspect allegedly used to issue threats ahead of Friday.",
      "These kinds of \u201cweirdo, individual, radical, conspiratorial worldviews\u201d are \u201ca phenomenon that has been rising steadily since the coronavirus, since we all moved our lives online and on social media,\u201d Schindler said.",
      "He said this does not absolve German authorities, who were given an unspecified warning about al-Abdulmohsen last year. Musk posted that he \u201cshould never have been allowed to enter Germany\u201d and \u201cshould have been extradited.\u201d",
      "NBC News emailed X requesting comment about the criticism of Musk\u2019s remarks, as well as accusations that X failed to act on violent posts from the suspect, but the company did not respond.",
      "The competing narratives over al-Abdulmohsen\u2019s acts and beliefs look set to continue this week, with the AfD holding a memorial service for the victims, which some critics have derided as insensitive political opportunism.",
      "\u201cA bloody act like the one that occurred yesterday in #Magdeburg must never be repeated!\u201d the local AfD X account posted. \u201cLet us ensure that Magdeburg and Saxony-Anhalt become a place of carefree coexistence again.\u201d"

      "In a nod to that reality, Charles delivered his annual King's Speech from a former hospital chapel \u2014 a break with tradition, and the first time in more than a decade that the Christmas address has not been recorded from a royal palace or estate.",
      "In his speech, Charles extended a \u201cspecial, heartfelt thanks to the selfless doctors and nurses\u201d who he said had \"supported me and other members of my family through the uncertainties and anxieties of illness, and have helped provide the strength, care and comfort we have needed.\"",

      "\u201cI wish you, and all those you love, a most joyful and peaceful Christmas,\u201d Charles said.",
      "Christmas is a \u201creally important occasion for the royal family,\u201d Katie Nicholl, Vanity Fair\u2019s royal correspondent, told NBC News, noting that the last time the public saw the family \u201call out smiling, doing what they love, which is meeting members of the public, was Christmas Day\u201d last year.",

      "Small anti-monarchy protests also greeted Charles during an October trip to Australia, which is set to vote on a referendum on whether to remain a constitutional monarchy. The death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth, revived debates among Commonwealth countries about leaving the monarchy, with some planning referendums to vote on whether to remove Charles as head of state.",

      "However, this closeness within the royal family highlights the divide with Charles\u2019 younger son, Prince Harry.",

      "Although Harry has spoken of his hopes for reconciliation, Nicholl noted, \u201cit does seem some way off.\u201d",

In the spring, Harry\u00a0officially considered himself a resident of the U.S., according to a U.K. regulatory filing. He and Meghan relocated to California in 2020 after stepping back from royal duties.",

      "Following meetings between U.S. diplomats and\u00a0HTS in Dasmacus last week, in which\u00a0al-Sharaa committed to ensuring terrorist groups do not pose a threat to the U.S. and its allies, the U.S. said it was set to remove the $10 million bounty\u00a0it had placed\u00a0on his head.",
      "The Biden administration has also said it is weighing whether to remove HTS from its list of terrorist organizations, but that will depend on whether it views al-Sharaa and his new leadership group as one that it can engage with.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re watching what they do now,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday last week. \u201cThey want to be inclusive in dealing with other groups inside Syria, making clear that they respect women and minorities as they establish interim governing authorities\u2014and making clear that Syria won\u2019t be used as a base for terrorist groups.\u201d",
      "The U.S. military said Monday that it had conducted an airstrike in Syria that killed two Islamic State operatives and wounded another.",
      "\"The terrorists were moving a truckload of weapons which were destroyed during the strike,\" it said on X. \"This strike occurred in an area formerly controlled by the Syrian regime and Russians.\"",
      "Meanwhile, al-Sharaa made an agreement with rebel factions to dissolve their groups and merge them under the country's defense ministry, part of the new leader's ongoing efforts to build a cohesive state after 53 years of Assad family rule.",
      "The need for a cohesive and discipled Syrian security force became acutely obvious on Tuesday when two people were killed and four others injured in the city of Manbij, eastern Aleppo, according the Syrian Civil Defense."

      "But even staying put poses a risk to 400 people, including patients, medics and sheltering civilians, who are in Kamal Adwan Hospital, according to its director, Dr. Husam Abu Safiya.",
      "Abu Safiya said that, over the weekend, tanks and bulldozers encircled the hospital\u2019s western gates, with heavy gunfire continuously aimed at the facility in Beit Latiya.",
      "\u201cBullets had penetrated the intensive care unit, the maternity department and the specialized surgery department,\u201d he said in a statement issued via WhatsApp.",
      "On Telegram, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry also stated that the hospital was being attacked with explosives.",

      "By then, \u201cthankfully,\u201d patients had been moved to the hospital\u2019s internal corridors, Abu Safiya said.",
      "The Israeli military declined to respond on the record to Abu Safiya\u2019s allegations, but on Friday it told Reuters it had sent food and fuel to the hospital and helped evacuate \"more than 100 patients\" and others.",
      "In October, Israeli forces stormed and then withdrew from Kamal Adwan Hospital, leaving a trail of destruction after a dayslong siege and overnight airstrikes that killed dozens. The United Nations\u2019 human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, labeled the offensive one of the \u201cdarkest moments\u201d in the conflict.",

      "The war that followed the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 and saw 250 taken hostage has decimated Gaza. Israeli forces have since killed some 45,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and destroyed much of the enclave\u2019s health system.",

      "She added, \u201cAny newborn baby fighting to sustain its breaths from inside a hospital incubator is entirely defenseless and entirely reliant on specialist medical care and equipment to survive.\u201d",
      "Doctors have floated that the Indonesian Hospital, located just outside the Jabaliya refugee camp, could serve as an alternative for transferring patients from Kamal Adwan. But they added that transporting patients and providing the necessary resources there would prove difficult.",
      "\u201cThe Indonesian Hospital has nonoperational generators, and there is also an oxygen station that is not functioning,\u201d Abu Safiya said.",
