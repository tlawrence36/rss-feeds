      "The five-member K-pop group 1VERSE is debuting Friday, with two North Korean defectors alongside members from the United States and Japan",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- With two out of five of its members North Korean defectors, the K-pop group 1VERSE is breaking new ground as it debuts its single album Friday.",
      "The band represents an unusual convergence of backgrounds: North Korea-born rapper Hyuk and singer Seok join Nathan from Arkansas, Kenny from Los Angeles, and Aito from Japan.",
      "While not the first K-pop act to include North Korean defectors \u2014 BE BOYS\u2019 Hak Seong debuted earlier this year \u2014 the diversity of the group's members add a rare dimension to the genre\u2019s growing global diversity.",
      "The group debuts Friday with their single album \u201cThe 1st Verse\u201d under Seoul-based label Singing Beetle. Their title track \u201cShattered\u201d features lyrics co-written by Hyuk and Kenny.",
      "\u201cWith members from different countries all coming together as 1VERSE, I just thought \u2018we can do this regardless of background\u2019 going forward,\u201d said Aito, the group\u2019s youngest member from Chiba, Japan.",
      "Hyuk, who lived in North Korea\u2019s North Hamgyong Province until age 12, defected to the South in 2013. His journey to K-pop stardom began while working in a factory in South Korea, where a chance encounter with the CEO of a music label eventually led to weekend rap lessons in Seoul.",
      "\u201cI went to university but then things went bad. It was when COVID was pretty severe, and a bad incident happened, so I had no choice but to work at a factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Initially skeptical, Hyuk thought the invitation to become a pop star might be a scam. He recalled thinking: \u201cI really have nothing right now, even if you rob me, not even dust would come out.\"",
      "After a year of meetings where the music executive consistently bought him meals and encouraged his training, Hyuk joined the agency in late 2021.",
      "Seok\u2019s path was similarly unconventional. A former soccer player who started playing at 8 years old in North Korea, he defected in 2019. He declined to provide additional details, citing safety concerns.",
      "After arriving in South Korea, he briefly played for a semi-professional team before pursuing physical education studies. During weekend soccer games he was approached about an idol training program.",
      "\u201cI was starting music for the first time, right? So I started with the mindset that if it doesn\u2019t work out, I can just stop and try something else,\u201d Seok said.",
      "Both members\u2019 experiences reflect harsh realities they left behind. Hyuk described spending eight to 10 hours daily collecting firewood as a child just to survive.",
      "\u201cWhere I lived, we had to collect firewood just to cook rice and survive day by day \u2014 it was essential,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Hyuk didn't have much access to music growing up. \u201cSince I lived struggling every day, I lived so busily that I wonder if I even had time to listen to music \u2014 I didn\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d he said.",
      "Seok had some exposure to K-pop in North Korea, listening occasionally to f(x)\u2018s \u201cLA chA TA\u201d and Super Junior songs despite it being illegal in North Korea to listen to South Korean music. \u201cI probably heard K-pop back in elementary school. But I couldn\u2019t listen often since it was illegal,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts and defectors say K-pop and other South Korean pop culture products have emerged as a challenge to North Korea\u2019s leadership as they steadily gained popularity among the public.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has intensified campaigns since the pandemic to eliminate South Korean cultural influence.",
      "Nathan, from Arkansas, first encountered K-pop through his Texas-based cousins who were longtime fans. \u201cI would kind of just pretend to be a hater, like urgh, K-pop. And then I just so happened to come across EXO\u2019s \u2018Growl\u2019 music video on YouTube,\u201d he recalled.",
      "The group\u2019s diverse backgrounds are reflected in their training, which includes courses on global citizenship. \u201cWe want to be inclusive of everyone\u2019s history, everyone\u2019s current situations back home,\u201d Kenny explained.",
      "Seok expressed excitement about connecting with international fans, particularly in America. \u201cSince I came from North Korea, it\u2019s hard to see foreigners there. So I really wanted to see people from other countries,\u201d he said.",
      "The group has already gained traction online. Seok described filming emotional video diaries during difficult early training days, which fans responded to with supportive messages.",
      "\u201cI filmed that diary video with somewhat emotional, slightly teary feelings. And I uploaded it to TikTok or YouTube, and fans sent me comforting letters,\" he said. \u201cAs soon as I saw the first line, tears came out and I was really touched.\u201d",
      "Hyuk acknowledged the attention their North Korean background generates while emphasizing the group\u2019s collective identity.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very grateful that people are paying attention to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay as long as it doesn\u2019t lean too much to one side ... it\u2019s not just me but all our members are here too, it\u2019s a journey we\u2019re creating together.\u201d",
      "The group\u2019s debut single album is available on all major streaming platforms.",

      "Thursday's sale came a day after the Rosebud sled from \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d went for a staggering $14.75 million, making it one of the priciest props in movie history.",
      "They were part of the Summer Entertainment Auction being held all week by Heritage Auctions.",
      "Heritage says the overall take has made it the second-highest grossing entertainment auction of all time, and there's still a day to go.",
      "Yet to be up for bids are Macaulay Culkin's knit snow cap from \u201cHome Alone,\u201d a Kurt Russell revolver from \u201cWyatt Earp,\u201d a pair of \u201cHattori Hanzo\u201d prop swords from \u201cKill Bill Vol. 1\" and a first edition set of Harry Potter novels signed by J.K. Rowling.",
      "The whip sold Thursday was used during the Holy Grail trials that Ford's character goes through at the climax of 1989's \u201cIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\u201d",
      "Ford gave it to then-Prince Charles at the film's U.K. premiere. It was given as a gift to Princess Diana, who gave it to the current owner, who was not identified. The buyer also was not identified.",
      "\u201cThe bullwhip is the iconic symbol of an iconic character of cinema history, Indiana Jones, and has been a highlight of this auction,\" Joe Maddalena, Heritage\u2019s executive vice president, said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "The $525,000 price includes the \u201cbuyers premium\u201d attached to all auction items for the house that sells it.",
      "Heritage said the nearly $15 million bid for the Rosebud sled puts it second only to the $32.5 million that Judy Garland's ruby slippers from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d fetched in December. Neither of those buyers were identified either.",
      "The sled was sold by longtime owner Joe Dante, director of films including \u201cGremlins.\u201d",
      "\u201cRosebud\u201d is the last word spoken by the title character in director Orson Welles' 1941 film \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d and the hunt for its meaning provides the film's plot. Many critics have regarded it as the best film ever made.",
      "Long thought lost, the sled is one of three of the prop known to have survived. Dante stumbled on it when he was filming on the former RKO Pictures lot in 1984. He wasn\u2019t a collector, but knew the value of the sled and quietly preserved it for decades, putting it as an Easter egg into four of his own films.",
      "Dante's friend and mentor Steven Spielberg paid $60,500 for another of the sleds in 1982, and anonymous buyer paid $233,000 for the third in 1996.",

      "In Alaska, a public radio station general manager took a moment from a busy day warning her community about a possible tsunami for a special task \u2014 sending a text message to Sen. Lisa Murkowski urging her to vote against a measure to strip federal fund...",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.",
      "Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio \u2014 to Adams' station.",
      "At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS \u2014 a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.",
      "Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.",
      "Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task \u2014 texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.",
      "\u201cI thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,\u201d Adams said.",
      "The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.",
      "The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.",
      "\u201cMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. \u201cThere is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.\u201d",
      "The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.",
      "Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like \u201cCaillou\u201d and \u201cDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood\u201d to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.",
      "\u201cThis is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cThat is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.\u201d",
      "Maine\u2019s public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he\u2019s not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state\u2019s residents.",
      "Maine\u2019s rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a \u201clifeline\u201d to her growing up off the grid.",
      "NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.",
      "NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. \u201cThat is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,\u201d she said.",
      "The affair transcends violins and piccolos. NPR received support Thursday from the heavy metal band Gwar, whose lead singer Blothar the Berserker posted a call on social media for fans to pay attention to what is going on with public media.",
      "Already, public media is seeing an increase in donations from reader and viewers to support its mission, and stations are actively sounding the alarm. In a plea to listeners on its website Thursday, Philadelphia's WXPN radio pointed to its legacy in helping people discover new music. \u201cThe most important thing you can do is support WXPN and the public media system in a way that is meaningful to you,\u201d the station urged on its website.",
      "But donations aren't going to fill the hole left by the loss in federal funding, Maher said. The public media leaders have already turned to lobbying Congress to restore some of the funding through the appropriations process for next year's budget. They don't know how much time they have; Maher said it would be inordinately costly, and perhaps prohibitive, to reopen a radio station that is forced to close.",
      "Public media isn't getting any help from states, either. At least five states have reduced their own outlays for public media this year, either for budget or political reasons.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, vetoed nearly $6 million that Florida lawmakers had set aside for public broadcasters the day before the state's budget took effect on July 1. \u201cDone in Florida,\u201d DeSantis responded on social media to a Trump post calling public broadcasting a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that should be defunded.",
      "Back in Alaska, KMXT public radio station\u2019s general manager, Jared Griffin, called the Senate vote a \u201cdevastating gut punch.\u201d He estimated that the cuts would amount to 22% of KMXT\u2019s budget. Griffin said the station\u2019s board has already agreed on a plan to furlough staff members one day a month, and he\u2019s taking a 50% pay cut.",
      "The station covers Kodiak Island, home to one of the nation\u2019s largest U.S. Coast Guard bases.",
      "\u201cWe have to dip into our savings while we figure out what KMXT is going to look like over the next six months, Griffin said. \u201dAt least for the next year we\u2019ll be fine but we\u2019re probably going to have to look at leasing space in our building to other organizations to help fill that gap.\u201d",
      "Unalaska resident Nikki Whittern said KUCB plays a vital role in the community during emergencies like the tsunami warning.",
      "\u201cThey broadcast everything, and they make sure that everybody knows and everybody\u2019s safe,\u201d said Whittern, a bartender. She spoke while preparing to open the Norwegian Rat Saloon \u2014 known to local fishermen simply as \u201cthe Rat\u201d \u2014 on Thursday morning.",

      "Members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell\u2019s onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, a fracas that prompted the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "They join a long and storied tradition of bandmates suing one another, taking interpersonal and legal troubles from the recording studio to the courtroom. Here\u2019s a look at a few very famous cases.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell\u2019s behavior on their recent tour had ranged from erratic to out of control, culminating in an assault where Farrell punched Navarro both onstage and backstage.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: It hasn't been; it's just getting started. Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: How much time do you have? The late, great Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys\u2019 leader, feuded with his cousin and bandmate Mike Love over songwriting credits dating back decades. Love had sued Wilson several times, beginning in the 1990s.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Wilson often wasn't the victor \u2014 except in 2007, when U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins threw out one of Love's lawsuits against Wilson. In it, Love alleged that a free, 2004 promotional CD of re-recorded Beach Boys songs cost him millions of dollars and violated Love and Wilson\u2019s partnership.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The sibling rivalry between Oasis brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher is well established. Their brawls not only led to the band\u2019s dissolution in 2009, before their 2025 reunion, but also a legal upset. In 2011, Liam sued Noel for saying Liam\u2019s hangover caused the cancellation of a 2009 festival performance. He said in a statement that the lawsuit was not about money, but that he wanted an apology and for Oasis fans \u201cto know the truth\u201d \u2014 that laryngitis prevented him from performing.",

      "WHAT HAPPENED: The post-breakup decades of Creedence Clearwater Revival were marked by so much legal and personal infighting that you might think CCR stands for Conflict, Clash, Repeat. In 1996, singer-songwriter-guitarist John Fogerty sued ex-bandmates Doug Clifford and Stu Cook for performing under the name Creedence Clearwater Revisited. That case settled in 2001, but the bandmates sued Fogerty in 2014, alleging he was violating the settlement by continuing to publicly slag off the Revisited name. And they said Fogerty himself was now illegally using Creedence Clearwater Revival in concert advertising. Fogerty sued back in 2015, saying Cook and Clifford weren\u2019t paying him proper songwriting royalties for their performances.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A federal court merged the two cases, and the resulting hybrid was settled under confidential terms in 2017.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Fleetwood Mac and feuds are practically synonymous. Breakups and divorces between members are essential to some of their best songs. The conflict resumed in the 2010s when the band kicked lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham off their 2018 tour, and he sued. Buckingham claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that January that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: At some point, two key members of Journey stopped believin' in each other. And all over an Amex. Longtime guitarist Neal Schon sued longtime keyboardist Jonathan Cain in 2022, saying Cain was refusing to let him use the band's American Express card. A counterclaim came from Cain, who said that Schon was running up enormous personal charges on the band's account.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A judge in 2024 appointed a custodian over the band's financial decisions, specifically empowered to settle disagreements between Schon and Cain.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: In 2023, Daryl Hall sued his longtime music partner John Oates, arguing that Oates' plan to sell off his share of a joint venture would violate the terms of a business agreement the Hall & Oates duo had forged long before. The move quickly prompted a judge to temporarily block the sale.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit and arbitration are ongoing.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Their artistic partnership had been over for months, but the Beatles had to break out the barristers to break up their business. Paul McCartney went to London\u2019s High Court of Justice in 1970 to dissolve the Fab Four's 1967 contractual partnership, which included the Apple record label. McCartney above all wanted to get rid of manager Allen Klein, whom John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr wanted to keep as overseer of their business. \u201cThe only way for me to save The Beatles and Apple,\u201d McCartney told British GQ in 2020, \u201cwas to sue the band.\u201d",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The court ruled in McCartney's favor and appointed a receiver to oversee their ventures in 1971. But negotiations and wrangling continued until a long-term solution that would become known as \u201cThe Beatles Agreement\u201d was signed by all four members in 1974.",

    "story": [
      "The 1950s and \u201960s pop singer Connie Francis died Thursday at 87",
      "Connie Francis was a giant of 1950s and '60s sugary-sweet pop, notching more than a dozen hits. In the months leading up to her death, announced Thursday, she experienced one more in \u201cPretty Little Baby,\u201d which has become a viral hit on TikTok six decades after its release.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 22.5 million TikTok videos have been created using the sound, often partnering videos of baby animals, toddlers, makeup tutorials and retro fashions. According to TikTok, those videos have amassed more than 45.5 billion views, globally. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and North West have used it, too, with West lip-syncing along to the track.",
      "Hooky, feel-good pop songs tend to do well on TikTok, and 1962's \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d is an exemplar of that phenomenon. Users gravitated toward the song's wholesome simplicity, sweet vocals, delicate organ and upstroke riffs. \u201cYou can ask the flowers / I sit for hours / Telling all the bluebirds / The bill and coo birds / Pretty little baby, I\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d Francis swoons on the verse that has picked up steam on the platform.",
      "And all of this has transpired in mere months: According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d was earning just over 17,000 on-demand audio streams in the U.S. during the week ending April 10. A month later, that number had climbed to 2.4 million. That\u2019s a growth of over 7,000%. The song has earned over 29 million streams this year so far.",
      "In one popular video, which garnered over 56 million views, a user posted about baby teething hacks for first-time moms. Another user, Amari Goins, posted a video, with over 112 million views, of her 2-year-old daughter singing along to the lyrics, noting that her toddler picked up the song because of how often they heard it on TikTok.",
      "Most recently, TikTok users have begun posting covers of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d as part of a singing challenge, where they exaggerate Francis' performance with their own stylized vocal runs. Francis, who died at 87, herself joined TikTok as a result of her song's popularity, and her first two videos \u2014 which earned 16.3 million and 31.2 million views, respectively \u2014 furthered engagement. In her first video, posted in early June, she said she was \u201cflabbergasted and amazed\u201d at the song's resurgence.",
      "\u201cTo think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me,\u201d Francis said in that first post, which she followed with a clip of herself lip-syncing to the song.",
      "For decades, the song lived in relative obscurity \u2014 written by Don Stirling and Bill Nauman for Francis, it was never a single and was originally released in the U.K. as the B-side of her 1962 single \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Warm This Winter.\u201d It appears on her album \u201cConnie Francis Sings \u2018Second Hand Love,\u2019\u201d released the same year. More than 60 years later, the song reached No. 20 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart in June 2025 and hit both the Hot 100\u2019s Bubbling Under chart and the Billboard Global 200.",
      "In Francis' last TikTok video, posted late last month, she thanked the \u201cmany wonderful artists\u201d who paid tribute to her, and all the users who sang along with her.",
      "Peter Lemongello Jr., a singer and performer who called Francis a friend, posted a TikTok in May where he sang the song to Francis, what he wrote on Facebook was \u201cone of the greatest and most exciting moments of my career so far.\u201d The video garnered over 15 million views.",
      "\u201cThere are no words to express this monumental loss,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cI will be forever grateful to her for the help she gave me with my career.\u201d",
      "Ian Paget, a TikTok creator, posted a tearful video Thursday and said he hopes Francis and her family \u201chave felt that love from the younger crowd learning who she is.\u201d",
      "The TikTok popularity of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d prompted her label Republic/UMe Records to reissue versions Francis had sung in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish in 1962. Bruce Resnikoff, president and CEO of UMe, wrote in a statement that the global catalog division was saddened but took \u201ccomfort in knowing how joyful and fulfilled she felt in these last few months, as a new generation discovered her music and celebrated her legacy.\u201d",
      "In May, as the song took off, Francis thanked TikTok and its users for \u201cthe wonderful, and oh so unexpected, reception\u201d in a Facebook post.",
      "As for her reaction to having a \u201cviral hit\u201d? She continued: \u201cClearly out of touch with present day music statistics terminology, my initial response was to ask: 'What\u2019s that?' Thank you everyone!\u201d",

      "Classic rocker Steve Miller has canceled his U.S. tour because he said severe weather including extreme heat and unpredictable flooding poses a danger to his band, its fans and crew.",
      "The tour was set to kick off in August and run through early November, with nearly three dozen stops across the U.S. including cities in New York, Tennessee, Florida and California.",

      "Lin-Manuel Miranda is using the 10th anniversary Broadway performance of *Hamilton* to support nonprofits providing immigration services",
      "Lin-Manuel Miranda plans to use the 10th anniversary Broadway performance of his award-winning cultural phenomenon \u201cHamilton\u201d as a fundraiser for a coalition of nonprofits providing immigration services.",
      "The Aug. 6 performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d at Broadway\u2019s Richard Rodgers Theatre is expected to raise about $3 million for the Immigrants: We Get the Job Done Coalition, 14 nonprofits ranging from the Hispanic Federation and National Immigration Law Center to the Haitian Bridge Alliance and the Tahirih Justice Center. The donation will come from Miranda, the Miranda Family and Miranda Family Fund, and the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast.",
      "It seemed like a fitting tribute to \u201cHamilton\u201d and its inspiration, Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, Miranda told The Associated Press, though he recognizes that Hamilton wouldn\u2019t have called himself an immigrant.",
      "\u201cHis narrative in our country kind of mirrors that of an immigrant story,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cHe did not grow up here. He didn\u2019t come from England. He came from the Caribbean, escaping harsh circumstances. And he really helped shape this country.\u201d",
      "Miranda did exclusively reveal some plans for the special, invite-only \u201cHamilton\u201d anniversary show and the preshow reception that he will host. Fans already know the possibilities after the special \u201cHamilton\u201d medley at the Tonys in June. Even the audience will be \u201cstacked,\u201d he said, since every actor who has ever performed during the show's Broadway run will be invited to be in the audience to watch the show\u2019s current Broadway cast that night. \u201cWe\u2019re working on something special for the curtain call and another nice special thing after that,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can say.\u201d",
      "The bulk of the invites have gone to winners selected from a Prizeo sweepstakes, where entrants donated at least $10 to the Immigrants coalition. A few dozen VIP packages, ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, will be available Thursday through the Hispanic Federation, with proceeds also going to the coalition.",
      "\u201cOne of America\u2019s greatest exports -- at least for me growing up -- was the immigration narrative,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cSo many people I know\u2026 came to this country from somewhere else seeking a better life and then helped make this country better by being here. And I believe that\u2019s one of the greatest promises, one of greatest things about the American experiment, and I\u2019ll continue to fight for that and support organizations that are helping that cause.\u201d",
      "And the organizations that will benefit from the donations generated by the \u201cHamilton\u201d 10th anniversary, better known as #Hamilten, say the donations and encouragement are sorely needed now.",
      "Since the start of his second term, President Donald Trump swiftly moved to make good on \u201cMass Deportation Now!\u201d promises from his campaign. His administration has encouraged U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain and deport people quickly, even to countries where they have never been, in order to rein in illegal immigration.",
      "Hispanic Federation President and CEO Frankie Miranda, no relation to Lin-Manuel Miranda, said he is heartened by the more than 125,000 people who have donated to the \u201cHamilton\u201d fundraiser. \u201cI think it is the beginning of what could be an incredible movement of philanthropy and individual donors basically saying, \u2018Enough is enough\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen it also in the different demonstrations of people around the country where they are expressing their concern and their frustration out in the streets.\u201d",
      "Hispanic Federation has already lost millions in federal funding, as the Trump administration cuts support for workplace development initiatives and environmental justice work, Frankie Miranda said. He has also seen some corporations withdraw their financial support because they fear reprisals from the Trump administration. \u201cWe need bold ideas like \u2018Hamilton\u2019 where everybody feels that they can stand behind it,\u201d he said.",
      "Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, another coalition member, said the donations would help her group continue to provide community legal services to individuals, while also pursuing lawsuits like its challenge to the Trump executive order seeking to strip away birthright citizenship from some children born in the United States.",
      "\u201cAt this time, when so many people are afraid to speak out and support vulnerable communities, Lin-Manuel Miranda being willing to use the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 platform just shows real leadership and bravery,\u201d Kohli said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping that more donors will step up and support our sector. We are the firewall between authoritarianism and democracy.\u201d",
      "Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, said her nonprofit plans to use the donations from the coalition to support its Defending Democracy initiative, which informs immigrants of their rights and uses the law as \u201ca bulwark against unconstitutional actions carried out by this administration.\u201d",
      "Matos sees it as a \u201cfull circle\u201d moment to use funding generated by \u201cthe story of one of our nation\u2019s Founding Fathers who himself was an indigent immigrant, who through his own grit, determination and his brilliance, worked his way up.\u201d \u201cHe was somebody who thought deeply about this new nation\u2019s democracy,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat better way to honor Hamilton and to express our gratitude for these resources?\u201d",
      "For Lin-Manuel Miranda, the fact that people remain fascinated by \u201cHamilton\u201d 10 years later also leaves him feeling grateful.",
      "And he remains surprised by the resonance of the line \u201cImmigrants: We get the job done,\u201d a line shared in the show by Hamilton and French military officer Marquis de Lafayette at the Battle of Yorktown.",
      "\u201cI thought it was no big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from the moment it was performed on stage, the audience reaction was so joyous at just the utterance of that simple fact. It\u2019s one of the things that just heartens me and gives me hope. In these dark times, it still gets a big cheer.\u201d",
      "The cheering still requires the show to add extra measures of music to wait for the audience to calm down before continuing with the song \u201cYorktown.\u201d Miranda attributes it to the fact that so many Americans are only one or two generations away from an immigrant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same reason why that No Kings protest vastly outnumbered the military parade happening on the same day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who believe in basic decency and treating people who come here -- often from really tough situations -- with humanity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction have filed dueling lawsuits after an onstage scuffle last year prompted the cancellation of the band's tour",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell's onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, prompting the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell's behavior on the tour had ranged from erratic to out-of-control, culminating in the assault, where Perry punched Navarro both on stage and backstage.",
      "\u201cWith a series of swift blows, he single-handedly destroyed the name, reputation, trademark, and viability of the Band and those who built it,\u201d their lawsuit says.",
      "Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "\u201cNavarro, Avery and Perkins apparently decided,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cthat Jane\u2019s Addiction\u2019s decades of success should be jettisoned in pursuit of a yearslong bullying campaign against Farrell involving harassing him onstage during performances, including, among other tactics, trying to undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing.\u201d",
      "The Farrells said that Navarro and Avery actually assaulted them.",
      "Perry Farrell said he was \u201cblindsided\u201d when the other members canceled the remaining 15 shows of the tour and broke up the band without consulting him, costing all of them a great deal of money.",
      "And he said his bandmates defamed him by publicly saying after the fight that he had mental health problems.",
      "Jane's Addiction was an essential part of the Los Angeles music scene in the late 1980s with their combination of elements of punk, goth and psychedelic sounds and culture. They became a national phenomenon with hits including \u201cJane Says\u201d and \u201cBeen Caught Stealing,\u201d and through their founding of the Lollapalooza tour, whose first incarnations they headlined in 1991.",
      "The group broke up soon after but returned several times in various incarnations. The 2024 tour was the first time the original members had played together since 2010.",
      "Farrell missed all seven of the group's rehearsals in the run-up to the tour, his bandmate's lawsuit alleges, and his behavior during the early shows ranged from erratic to out-of-control.",
      "\u201cHe struggled night to night amid public concern for his well-being and apparent intoxication,\u201d their lawsuit says. \u201cPerry forgot lyrics, lost his place in songs he had sung since the 1980s, and mumbled rants as he drank from a wine bottle onstage.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says Farrell was given many solutions to the volume problem, none of which he followed.",
      "Then on Sept. 13 at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston in front of about 4,000 fans, videos partially captured Farrell lunging at Navarro and bumping Navarro with his shoulder before taking a swing at the guitarist with his right arm. Navarro is seen holding his right arm out to keep Farrell away before Farrell is dragged away.",
      "But Farrell's lawsuit says the \u201cvideo evidence is clear that the first altercation onstage during the Boston show was hardly one-sided.\u201d It says Navarro was deliberately playing loud to drown out the singer, and \"what followed was an inappropriate violent escalation by Navarro and Avery that was disproportionate to Farrell\u2019s minor body check of Navarro.\"",
      "Farrell alleges that when he was being restrained by a crew member, Avery punched him in the kidneys, and that both Avery and Navarro assaulted him and his wife backstage.",
      "Shortly after the fight, Farrell in a statement apologized to his bandmates, especially Navarro, for \u201cinexcusable behavior.\u201d",
      "Both lawsuits allege assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract, among other claims.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Navarro, Perkins and Avery's lawsuit says, \u201cthe Band will never have their revival Tour, to celebrate a new album and 40+ years of deep, complex, chart-topping recordings. Instead, history will remember the Band as suffering a swift and painful death at the hands of Farrell\u2019s unprovoked anger and complete lack of self-control.\"",

      "The Duke of Sussex is in the southern African country with the Halo Trust organization, the same group Princess Diana worked with when she went to Angola in January 1997, seven months before she was killed in a car crash in Paris.",
      "Diana's advocacy and the images of her walking through a minefield helped mobilize support for a land mine ban treaty that was ratified later that year.",
      "Harry walked through a land mine field near a village in Cuito Cuanavale in southern Angola, according to Halo Trust. It's not the first time he has retraced his mother's steps after traveling to Angola for a similar awareness campaign in 2019.",
      "The land mines across Angola were left behind from its 27-year civil war from 1975 to 2002. The Halo Trust says at least 60,000 people have been killed or injured by land mines since 2008. It says it has located and destroyed over 120,000 land mines and 100,000 other explosive devices in Angola since it started work in the country in 1994, but 1,000 minefields still need to be cleared.",

      "The countdown to Lee Corso\u2019s final appearance on ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d will kick off when the longtime analyst and former coach is honored at the ESPYS on Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique opportunity we have to weave him into the evening and really begin the process of sending him off with full honors,\u201d ESPN\u2019s president of content Burke Magnus said. \u201cTo get him there in person to acknowledge all of his contributions and what he\u2019s meant to both the company and sports, but more importantly the fans, we just think it\u2019s a fitting way to kick off his departure.\u201d",
      "Kirk Herbstreit, Desmond Howard and Pat McAfee will give their thoughts about Corso before a video tribute airs. Corso will then have a couple of minutes to be acknowledged by the crowd at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.",
      "Corso \u2014 the lone remaining member of the show's original cast who turns 90 in August \u2014 announced earlier this year that his final show would be on the opening week of the season. ESPN last month revealed the 39th season of \u201cGameDay\u201d would begin in Columbus, Ohio, before defending national champion Ohio State hosts the Texas Longhorns on Aug. 30.",
      "Corso's popular headgear segment started at Ohio State on Oct. 5, 1996, before the Buckeyes faced Penn State. Since then, he has gone 286-144 in 430 selections wearing everything from helmets and mascot heads to dressing up as the Fighting Irish leprechaun from Notre Dame, the Stanford tree and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. He has worn 69 different school\u2019s mascot headgear.",
      "His television career withstood a stroke in 2009 that left him unable to speak for a while. Even though his appearances on the road have decreased in recent seasons, he was in Atlanta in January for the College Football Playoff national title game between Ohio State and Notre Dame.",
      "\u201cWith the popularity and cultural phenomenon that \u2018GameDay\u2019 became, there\u2019s no one more responsible for that than Lee Corso. The way he changed the way the game was covered with the irreverence, the humor, the lack of a filter, all of those things that sort of set the tone and the standard,\" said \u201cGameDay\u201d host Rece Davis.",

      "Justin Timberlake had \u201cTrolls.\u201d Rihanna has \u201cSmurfs.\u201d Now, we patiently await a \u201cGummi Bears\u201d with the Biebs.",
      "But first we have \u201cSmurfs,\u201d which, like \u201cTrolls,\u201d gets as much mileage as it can from its pop singer-voice actor. Rihanna voices Smurfette and supplies a new song, giving a half-hearted injection of star power to an otherwise uninspired, modestly scaled, kiddo-friendly cartoon feature.",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d directed by Chris Miller ( \u201cPuss in Boots,\u201d \u201cShrek the Third\u201d), cribs heavily from the \u201cTrolls\u201d playbook. Both feature brightly colored little forest creatures that like a good tune. In the opening of \u201cSmurfs,\u201d Papa Smurf (John Goodman) is DJing for a dancing Smurf Village.",
      "As the many Smurfs gyrate next to mushroom houses, you might find yourself wondering how we got here. And what, exactly, is a Smurf, anyway? It\u2019s been nearly 70 years since Belgian comic artist Peyo created \u201cLes Schtroumpfs,\u201d though most of those still familiar with the little blue fellas remember them from the 1980s Hanna-Barbera cartoons.",
      "The Smurfs have never really transcended their Saturday morning cartoon origins. Neither a pair of live-action hybrid movies in the early 2010s or a 2017 animated release have done much more than keep us vaguely aware of what a Phrygian cap is.",
      "And \u201cSmurfs\u201d is unlikely to change that. The best thing that can be said for the latest attempt to reboot the blue Belgian beings is that it maintains the light feel of a morning cartoon. Even with a brief SpongeBob SquarePants short running ahead of it, \u201cSmurfs\u201d \u2014 seemingly designed to be the least ambitious of all possible parent-child outings \u2014 passes in about 90 minutes.",
      "The pressing issue in Miller\u2019s film is that one Smurf, No Name Smurf (James Corden), lacks a defining feature. There are so many other labels already taken that all that\u2019s left for him are Clog Making Smurf and Shark Taming Smurf \u2014 and neither of those is promising, either.",
      "When No Name Smurf suddenly grows magical powers, he gets a boost in confidence but inadvertently sets off a dangerous chain reaction. The burst of magic reveals the location of Smurf Village and a long-hidden magical book that, if reunited with three others, confers world domination. (Fun fact: This is also what happens if you reunify all first editions of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d)",
      "The outburst brings the attention of the evil wizard Razamel, brother of Gargamel. (Both are excellently voiced by JP Karliak.) And the Smurfs are cast into a chase through dimensions to rescue the kidnapped Papa Smurf and prevent Razamel from seizing the fourth book. The trip takes them through Paris, Munich, Australia and, briefly, Claymation.",
      "The zaniness is often forced. There are also Koosh ball-like creatures named Snooter Poots with a leader named Mama Poot (Natasha Lyonne). And if you were ever hoping to hear Rihanna sing, as a Smurf, from the seat of a kangaroo pouch, your movie has finally arrived.",
      "But any expectations of something more quickly dissipate, despite the fact that \u201cSmurfs\u201d was scripted by Pam Brady, the screenwriter of \u201cHot Rod\u201d and co-writer of \u201cTeam America: World Police.\u201d Most of the attempts at adult-winking gags are hackneyed jokes about Zoom, podcasting, spam filters and LinkedIn.",
      "You can almost feel IP-rights pressures animating the entire enterprise. See, there are other Smurf names out there. What about Corporate Mandate Smurf?",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action, language and some rude humor. Running time: 92 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "The new \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d pretty much follows the plot of the 1997 film of the same name: A bunch of well-to-do young people get stalked and killed by a vengeful killer in a rain slicker with an ice hook. It even has some of the same stars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 1997 all over again. It\u2019s so nostalgic,\u201d says Freddie Prinze Jr., who stars in both, this time around. Responds another returning star, Jennifer Love Hewitt: \u201cNostalgia is overrated.\u201d",
      "That line deserves a big laugh from a so-called \u201clegacy sequel\u201d that blends old and new to resurrect a franchise long dormant but isn\u2019t sure where it sits in 2025. A wink here, an eye-gouging there.",
      "By aping the structure of the original \u2014 maddeningly calling itself by its predecessor's name \u2014 the new version of \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d is both too tentative a step forward and yet too reliant on the past to fully break free of that gravitational pull.",
      "The new installment follows a group of post-high school friends (Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Sarah Pidgeon and Tyriq Withers) who cause a fatal car wreck on July Fourth and swear to keep their involvement a secret. But a year later, someone wants them dead, offering the anniversary warning: \u201cI know what you did last summer.\u201d",
      "This is a franchise that got a bit lost in the shadow of the \u201cScream\u201d dynasty, but still helped make household names of such Gen X heroes as Prinze, Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe. A relaunch makes sense but it\u2019s pretty vapid stuff until the OGs arrive.",
      "In fact, you may find yourself rooting for the killer. The five youngsters who have grown up in Southport, North Carolina \u2014 \u201cthe Hamptons of the South\u201d \u2014 mostly live lives of nepo privilege, drinking from flasks, driving Volvos, munching on macarons and taking Adderall. One lives on a 156-foot (48-meter) yacht with three decks.",
      "The movie mostly muddles along like a TV special, only coming to life when Prinze and Hewitt arrive, asked by the hunted youngsters for guidance. After all, the duo survived the 1997 attacks. \u201cGet them before they get you,\u201d Hewitt's Julie advises.",
      "Director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sam Lansky, mixes gruesome stabbings, harpoon impalings and corpses displayed on hooks like fish at the dock with jokes that needle everything from Nicole Kidman's cheesy AMC commercials to our fling with true-crime podcasts.",
      "The filmmakers make half-hearted attempts to explain the ripple effects from trauma but we're not here for generational pain; we're here for the slashy-slashy. There is one dream sequence with a surprise returning OG that's worth the ticket price alone.",
      "The tone is all over the place \u2014 whimpering victims one moment, horny the next. The police in Southport are nefarious \u2014 in a nod to \u201cJaws,\u201d they cover up the murders for fear of turning off tourism \u2014 but there's a \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d vibe here (even a mention) that seems less playful than idea-deprived. There are elements of spoof, too, like a vain woman who has just lost someone close in a grisly bloodbath but worries about her skin care.",
      "Look, we hate to break it to you, it's not going to end well for many of this privileged set, as they hunt whoever is hunting them. Coherence is also stabbed a lot because a clear motive for the mass murder is really hard to understand.",
      "No matter: We get the scene when a scared victim with a massive knife sticking out of her back shoots a harpoon gun at the hook killer, and that's why we came in the first place. We also get Hewitt screaming her catchphrase, mocking her attacker: \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Well, what are you waiting for?",
      "\u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cbloody horror violence, language throughout, some sexual content and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 111 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Romance novels have always spiced up quiet nights. Now, a genre that has sometimes been dismissed as a guilty pleasure is bringing readers and writers together through social media, book clubs and a growing number of romance-specific bookstores.",
      "At a recent launch party for Nora Dahlia's enemies-to-friends romance \u201cPick-Up\u201d at Lovestruck Books, a romance-dedicated store in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a crowd of women sipped cocktails from the bar-caf\u00e9 as they browsed the shelves.",
      "After Dahlia\u2019s reading, patrons stuck around to mingle, swap contact info and trade author recommendations.",
      "It was a particularly social event for a book talk. But the communal atmosphere is typical of events for romance fans.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re educated on the genre in a real way,\u201d Dahlia said. \u201cMany of them started reading romance \u2014 Danielle Steel, V.C. Andrews, Jude Deveraux \u2014 as teenagers.\u201d",
      "At The Ripped Bodice bookstore in Brooklyn, New York, manager Katherine Zofri said romance fans who have connected online frequently come into the store to meet in person. Along with author events, the store hosts three different book clubs and a romance comedy night.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple proposals here, we\u2019ve had a wedding here which was really fun,\u201d Zofri said.",
      "She said customers range \u201cfrom teenagers who are starting to really get into the romance genres to older folks who have been romance readers for their entire lives and remember way back when they were reading the Harlequins and romance wasn\u2019t as widely accepted.",

      "\u201cThe pandemic had pushed so many people toward reading for escape and comfort, and romance became a lifeline for a lot of folks,\u201d said Kanter.",
      "\u201cAt the same time, there was a wider cultural shift happening \u2014 people were rethinking what mattered, craving joy and softness, and looking to support indie businesses that reflected their values. Romance, with all its hope and heart, met that moment beautifully,\" she said.",
      "Romance has countless subgenres \u2014 hockey romance, Western romance, LGBTQ romance, even romance set on prison planets.

      "\u201cRomance must have a happily-ever-after \u2014 or at least a happily-for-now. Romance writers and readers are very clear on this,\u201d she said.",
      "Romantic fiction that doesn\u2019t end that way? That\u2019s just a love story.",
      "Traits of the romance genre also include strong character descriptions, attraction, conflict, and a satisfying resolution and emotional growth. Expect plenty of steam \u2014 some authors deploy it explicitly, others are more tame.",

      "Romance novels, she said, are \u201ca lovely reminder that individualism and companionship can go together. These are basic bonds.\u201d",
      "Podcasts, too, have become a source for discovering what's trending. Andrea Martucci, creator and host of the romance-focused \u201cShelf Love\u201d podcast, said romance bookstores have become places of connection akin, in some ways, to churches \u2014 for the romantically devoted.",

      "In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "DC and Warner Bros. had a lot riding on \u201cSuperman.\u201d While the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Marvel Studios has had its own share of struggles, the superheroes of DC have recently found mostly kryptonite in theaters. Films like \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d all flopped.",
      "But \u201cSuperman,\u201d written and directed by Gunn, is intended as a new start. It\u2019s the first release fully steered by Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios, since they were handed the keys to DC\u2019s superhero cinematic universe.",
      "And while Gunn turned \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d into a massive success for Marvel, his irreverent, idiosyncratic touch made the director \u2014 once a B-movie filmmaker with Troma Entertainment \u2014 an unlikely steward for one of the movies\u2019 most bankable and beloved brands.",
      "The roughly on-target opening was the third largest of 2025, and the first DC title to surpass $100 million in its opening weekend since \u201cWonder Woman\u201d in 2017.",
      "Ticket sales were relatively soft for \u201cSuperman\u201d overseas. In 78 international markets, it grossed $95 million. In China, it collected just $6.6 million.",
      "As an American icon, \u201cSuperman\u201d inevitably attracted political discourse. Some right-wing commentators criticized the movie as \u201cwoke\u201d after Gunn described the superhero from Krypton as \u201can immigrant.\u201d On X, the White House posted an image of President Donald Trump as Superman.",
      "In \u201cSuperman,\u201d which cost about $225 million to make, Gunn steers the Man of Steel in a drastically different tonal direction than in previous iterations from filmmaker Zack Snyder. Skipping the Kansas origin story, the film instead picks up with Superman ( David Corenswet ) after his first defeat. Rachel Brosnahan plays Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult is Lex Luthor.",
      "The \u201cSuperman\u201d debut didn\u2019t come close to besting the $166 million launch for Snyder\u2019s \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d in 2016. But it did open higher, not accounting for inflation, than Snyder\u2019s \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d That film debuted with $116 million in 2013.",
      "But while Snyder\u2019s films were often unloved by critics, largely good reviews greeted Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman.\u201d On Rotten Tomatoes, it scored 82% fresh \u2014 the best for the franchise since the first two movies with Christopher Reeve: \u201cSuperman\u201d (1978) and \u201cSuperman II\u201d (1980). Audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cSuperman\u201d faced sizeable competition too. Last week\u2019s top film, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d slid to second place with $40 million. With \u201cSuperman\u201d soaking up many large-format screens, Universal Pictures\u2019 seventh \u201cJurassic\u201d film slipped a steep 57% from its opening weekend. Starring Scarlett Johansson, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d got off to a thunderous $318.3 million global start. In two weeks, it\u2019s amassed $529.5 million worldwide.",
      "Also still in the mix is Apple Studios\u2019 biggest box-office success yet, \u201cF1.\u201d Joseph Kosinski\u2019s Formula One action thriller, starring Brad Pitt, came in third with $13 million in its third weekend. The film, distributed by Warner Bros., has collected $393.4 million globally in three weeks. But it also carries a hefty price tag of roughly $250 million, plus at least $100 million in promotion.",

      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d will crown season seven's winning couple Sunday evening after a tumultuous season",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cLove Island USA\u201d will crown the winning couple of its seventh season Sunday evening, culminating a tumultuous summer full of explosive breakups and shock exits.",
      "The finale will air on Peacock at 6 p.m. Pacific/9 p.m. Eastern, following a chart-topping run since the season premiered on June 3. The show brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "The show, an American spinoff to the UK series, has shaken up reality TV, becoming Peacock\u2019s most watched entertainment series on mobile devices, according to NBC Universal.",
      "This season follows breakout success from last summer, which captured mainstream attention. \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa,\u201d a new series spinoff premiering Sunday, follows Season 6's main cast as they navigate relationships, life and newfound social media fame in Los Angeles.",
      "This season has also been under fire as two contestants \u2013 Cierra Ortega and Yulissa Escobar \u2013 left the villa following resurfaced posts in which they used racial slurs.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained a slur against Asian people. She apologized for the resurfaced posts in a nearly five minute TikTok video Wednesday.",
      "Friday's episode saw the elimination of Ace Greene and Chelley Bissainthe, setting the stage for the finale. Green and Bissainthe were the only couple to maintain a relationship throughout most of the show.",
      "With $100,000 up for grabs for the winning couple, here\u2019s a look at the season\u2019s run and the final four couples heading into the finale.",
      "Stripped of their phones and connection with the outside world, five men and five women arrive in the villa and coupled up based on initial romantic interest. Throughout the season, the show introduces a steady stream of bombshells, new contestants who are brought in to disrupt existing relationships and build new storylines.",
      "Under constant surveillance, contestants partook in kissing competitions, heart rate challenges and drama-inducing games ripe for viral moments. The final six couples even became instant parents, startled awake by cries as they were tasked with taking care of baby dolls to further test their romantic connections.",
      "Halfway through the season, established couples were temporarily separated for Casa Amor, the show's ultimate test, and encouraged to explore new relationships with a fresh group of single contestants.",
      "Contestants are routinely dumped from the villa, removed either by a public vote or by the islanders themselves.",
      "Amaya Espinal, 25, made waves when she walked in as a bombshell early in the season and has been credited for some of the season\u2019s most viral moments.",
      "\u201cI never said I was perfect. I never said I didn\u2019t have any flaws. But at least I\u2019m pretty, and at least I\u2019m a little funny, and at least I\u2019m my own best friend,\u201d Espinal sang to herself in the makeup room, which prompted various covers online and inspired a Google pop-up message when you search up her nickname, Amaya Papaya.",
      "The New York City native, who labeled herself a \u201csensitive gangster,\u201d tested various connections, including Greene, Austin Shepard and Casa Amor contestant Zak Srakaew, that all fizzled out. Her previous partners on the show said Espinal, who is Dominican, expressed affection too quickly.",
      "A connection sparked between Espinal and Bryan Arenales, 28, a Casa Amor contestant, late in the season after he defended her, saying that \u201ccoming from a Hispanic household, calling someone babe, mi amor, mi vida, that\u2019s just how we talk.\u201d Arenales is from Boston and is of Puerto Rican and Guatemalan descent, according to his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cI always stress that as I get older, it\u2019s important to be with someone that keeps you young. I definitely think Amaya is that type of person,\u201d Arenales said during a confessional interview.",
      "Huda Mustafa, 24, and Chris Seeley, 27, explored different connections in Casa Amor before expressing interest in each other and eventually recoupling.",
      "Mustafa, from North Carolina, is the first contestant in the series to be a mother, which caused tension with her initial \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Jeremiah Brown. The two coupled up and developed a strong connection very quickly, causing the other contestants to doubt their relationship.",
      "Mustafa and Brown, 25, had a turbulent experience, leading to some of the most viral arguments of the season. The two eventually broke off their relationship and Brown was dumped from the villa halfway through the season.",
      "Mustafa explored other connections but remained single until Casa Amor, where she built a connection with Seeley, who was initially interested in Bissainthe.",
      "The two quickly developed an unexpected connection, bonding over Seeley's struggles with leaving his overseas basketball career and Huda\u2019s difficult experience with motherhood.",
      "\u201cI think me and her are actually really good for each other,\u201d Seeley said during a confessional interview. \u201cShe helps me kind of get out of my head and I help her, you know, be her true self and I calm her down in moments where she gets emotional or heated.\u201d",
      "The two hit a snag during the show\u2019s baby challenge, where they argued over Mustafa\u2019s lack of public displays of affection.",
      "Iris Kendall, 25, and Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez, 27, came in as bombshells with fellow contestant Jalen Brown in the ninth episode and explored various connections before coming together in the show\u2019s last recoupling.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez initially formed a strong connection with Hannah Fields, 23, which was cut short when a shocking dumping forced her to leave the villa and left him single.",
      "Kendall initially coupled up with Brown before he was dumped from the villa along with Fields. She developed a strong connection with TJ Palma, 23, who walked in as a bombshell in episode 15, and they became a couple.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez coupled up with Gracyn Blackmore, 25, during Casa Amor. Each respective couple remained together until Blackmore and Palma left the villa following a mass dumping late in the season, leaving both Kendall and Garcia-Gonzalez single.",
      "The pair, who had developed a strong friendship, then coupled up and started a romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cWith Iris, it just feels comfortable. I think it\u2019s that whole, you know, you\u2019re friends to start and then maybe it can become something else,\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez said during a confessional interview.",
      "Olandria Carthen, 27, and Nic Vansteenberghe, 24, had an unconventional path to the finale.",
      "The pair had expressed initial interest in each other during the first episode, before settling into separate couples. Carthen, an Alabama native, was set on finding her \u201ccowboy,\u201d coupling up with Taylor Williams, 24, from Oklahoma. The pair remained together for most of the season, though Williams sporadically mentioned he lacked a physical connection with Carthen.",
      "Vansteenberghe initially coupled up with Belle-A Walker, 22, before choosing to recouple with Ortega, who walked in as a bombshell at the end of the first episode. The pair remained together throughout the show until her abrupt departure from the villa a week ago.",
      "During Casa Amor, Carthen and Vansteenberghe didn\u2019t didn't find new connections and they were dumped from the villa. In a shocking twist, however, the contestants were offered a lifeline \u2014 they could return to the villa if they couple up with each other. The pair then briefly explored a romantic connection before ultimately deciding to remain friends.",
      "Carthen chose to return to Williams but was left single after he recoupled with Casa Amor contestant Clarke Carraway. Vansteenberghe and Ortega stayed together, but her departure days later ultimately left him single.",
      "Carthen and Vansteenberghe ultimately recoupled in the same episode.",
      "\u201cFor our journey to be almost identical is mind-blowing to me. I can\u2019t wrap my head around this situation,\u201d Carthen said during a recent confessional interview. \u201cMaybe it was Nic this whole time and we\u2019ve just been so oblivious to it.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he is considering \u201ctaking away\u201d the U.S. citizenship of a longtime rival, actress and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell, despite a decades-old Supreme Court ruling that expressly prohibits such an action by the government.",
      "\u201cBecause of the fact that Rosie O\u2019Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday. He added that O'Donnell, who moved to Ireland in January, should stay in Ireland \u201cif they want her.\u201d",
      "The two have criticized each other publicly for years, an often bitter back-and-forth that predates Trump\u2019s involvement in politics. In recent days, O\u2019Donnell on social media denounced Trump and recent moves by his administration, including the signing of a massive GOP-backed tax breaks and spending cuts plan.",
      "It's just the latest threat by Trump to revoke the citizenship of people with whom he has publicly disagreed, most recently his former adviser and one-time ally, Elon Musk.",
      "But O'Donnell's situation is notably different from Musk, who was born in South Africa. O'Donnell was born in the United States and has a constitutional right to U.S. citizenship. The U.S. State Department notes on its website that U.S. citizens by birth or naturalization may relinquish U.S. nationality by taking certain steps \u2013 but only if the act is performed voluntary and with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship.",
      "Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, noted the Supreme Court ruled in a 1967 case that the Fourteen Amendment of the Constitution prevents the government from taking away citizenship.",
      "\u201cThe president has no authority to take away the citizenship of a native-born U.S. citizen,\" Frost said in an email Saturday. \u201cIn short, we are nation founded on the principle that the people choose the government; the government cannot choose the people.\u201d",
      "O'Donnell moved to Ireland after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to win his second term. She has said she's in the process of obtaining Irish citizenship based on family lineage.",
      "Responding to Trump Saturday, O\u2019Donnell wrote on social media that she had upset the president and \u201cadd me to the list of people who oppose him at every turn.\u201d",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- In a small bookstore in the Caribbean's largest mall, dozens of people gathered on a recent evening for the launch of a slim dictionary. Its title is \u201cThe ABC of DtMF,\u201d which is short for \u201cDeB\u00cd TiRAR M\u00e1S FOToS,\u201d the newest album from Puerto Rico's latest prodigious son, Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, better known as Bad Bunny.",
      "The mostly older crowd flipped through the pages, seeking to understand more about Puerto Rico's culture, the places, phrases and references in Bad Bunny's music.",
      "The singer has elevated the global profile of the island, a U.S. territory, to new heights, promoting its traditional music, denouncing its gentrification and challenging its political status.",
      "It was an unexpected opportunity for an island that for years has cried out about its territorial status, dwindling affordable housing, high cost of living, chronic power outages, medical exodus and fragile economy. Pleas for change have been largely pushed aside, but Puerto Ricans are optimistic that Bad Bunny\u2019s new album and his series of 30 concerts that began Friday means they\u2019ll finally be heard.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to bring change, and there\u2019s a young generation who\u2019s going to back him,\u201d said Luis Rosado, 57, who this week attended the dictionary launch at the urging of his son, who lives abroad.",
      "Ten minutes before the first concert on Friday, a giant billboard on stage lit up with the words, \u201cPuerto Rico is a colony since Christopher Columbus \u2018discovered\u2019 the island during his second trip to the New World in 1493.\u201d",
      "The crowd that filled the 18,000-capacity coliseum whooped.",
      "\u201cThis album has sparked a conversation around the world about our situation as a colony,\u201d said Andrea Figueroa, a 24-year-old professional athlete who said foreigners have started to ask her about Puerto Rico and its issues, something she hopes might lead to change.",
      "Those born on the island of 3.2 million inhabitants are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, and they have one representative in Congress with limited voting powers.",
      "Figueroa said the album resonated with her because her father is one of thousands forced to leave the island in search of work as the economy crumbled. It\u2019s a sentiment Bad Bunny sings about in \u201cWhat happened to Hawaii,\u201d with the lyric, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to go to Orlando, but the corrupt ones kicked him out.\u201d",
      "The song taps into concern that the Puerto Rican identity is eroding amid an influx of people from the U.S. mainland, many of them attracted by a 2012 law that allows Americans to move to the island and pay no taxes on capital gains if they meet certain conditions.",
      "Hundreds of Americans also snapped up properties in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck the island as a powerful Category 4 storm in 2017, forcing more than 100,000 people to leave.",
      "\u201cThey want to take the river away from me and also the beach; they want my neighborhood and the grandma to leave,\u201d Bad Bunny sang on Friday as the crowd drowned out his voice.",
      "The artist spent half of Friday\u2019s concert singing from the porch and roof of a traditional Puerto Rican home that served as a second stage, where he wonders about its fate aloud because it\u2019s been rented: \u201cDo good people live there? Is it an Airbnb?\u201d",
      "The mostly young crowd booed loudly, flinching at their reality on an island where the housing price index increased by almost 60% from 2018 to 2024 and where short-term rentals have surged from some 1,000 in 2014 to more than 25,000 in 2023.",
      "However, they cheered upon seeing Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James emerge from the house as a surprise guest.",
      "The song hit Carmen Lourdes L\u00f3pez Rivera especially hard. She is the vice president of the Community Board Association of La Perla, an impoverished community once known for being Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest heroin distribution point.",
      "Investors with deep pockets have long sought to buy up the area, which is perched on a hill with deep turquoise waters lapping below a massive 16th-century fort popular with tourists.",
      "\u201cThey have always said they want to kick us out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for what belongs to us.\u201d",
      "The effect of Bad Bunny\u2019s album and concerts is already being felt.",
      "More than 35,000 hotel nights have been booked during the normally slow summer season, with the concerts expected to attract more than 600,000 visitors, generate more than $186 million and create more than 3,600 jobs, according to government officials.",
      "Beyond that, Bad Bunny\u2019s use of folkloric music like bomba and plena has revived interest in those musical traditions. Dozens of newcomers have requested classes and are seeking out teachers, said Jorge Gabriel L\u00f3pez Ol\u00e1n, 28, an experienced drummer.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s very necessary, isn\u2019t it? To understand where we come from and where our music and culture come from,\u201d he said.",
      "On Friday, Bad Bunny fans sported long ruffled skirts traditionally worn to dance bomba, while others donned straw hats known as a \u201cpava,\u201d worn by \u201cj\u00edbaros,\u201d Puerto Rican peasants. Musicians and dancers wore the same outfits on the main stage, which at one point even featured live chickens.",
      "Interest has surged to the point where universities including Princeton and Yale have launched courses on Bad Bunny. Albert Laguna, a Yale professor, described Bad Bunny\u2019s residence as a powerful move: \u201cInstead of me going to the world, right, I\u2019m going to start here.\u201d",
      "There is even renewed interest in the Puerto Rican crested toad, the island\u2019s sole indigenous toad species that is under threat and was featured in a video as part of Bad Bunny\u2019s newest album.",
      "Not even two weeks had passed since the album\u2019s launch and people already were sending in pictures to confirm if they had spotted the crested toad, said Abel Vale Nieves with Citizens of the Karst, an environmental nonprofit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we had not seen before,\u201d he said, adding that the album presented Puerto Rico\u2019s reality to the world: \u201cA situation of complete disadvantage where we don\u2019t have the right to a lot of things.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt creates interest in Puerto Rico\u2019s historical situation, and I think it did so in a wonderful way,\u201d he said, adding that the concerts will only boost visibility of the island\u2019s issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful opportunity.\u201d",

      "The removal of 21 children from a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family",
      "The removal of 21 children from the custody of a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family. Surrogacy has no federal regulation, leaving it up to states to set the rules if they choose to allow it.",
      "The kids \u2014 15 at the couple's mansion and six more living elsewhere \u2014 were taken by an LA County child welfare agency in May after the parents were accused of failing to intervene in the abuse of a baby by a nanny, police in Arcadia said.",
      "The children range in age from 2 months to 13 years, with most between 1 and 3, police said. The FBI won\u2019t comment but agents are investigating. Silvia Zhang, 38, and Guojun Xuan, 65, have not responded to emails seeking comment.",
      "Police believe Zhang gave birth to one or two of the children while the rest were born by surrogate. Some women who were paid surrogates for the couple now say they were unaware that the couple was accumulating a supersize family, raising questions about their intentions.",
      "\u201cWhat were they going to do with these children?\u201d said Deborah Wald, a lawyer in San Francisco whose expertise includes surrogacy law.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties to have a woman become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby. The intended parent or parents might struggle with infertility. They also could be same-sex couples.",
      "There\u2019s no limit on how many children someone can have through surrogates or any other method, said Wald, who is not involved in the Arcadia case.",
      "She acknowledged that California is considered a \u201csurrogacy-friendly state\" because it has clear laws around the process.",
      "Both sides are required to have lawyers, and there must be a written, notarized contract before an embryo transfer, Wald said.",
      "\u201cThe legitimate surrogacy community in California is very distressed when things like this happen,\u201d Wald said of surrogates feeling deceived. \u201dWe\u2019ve worked very hard on legal and ethical standards. It hurts everyone when something like this happens.\u201d",
      "There are businesses that act as matchmakers, connecting surrogates to people who want to have children. State business records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investment LLC had been registered at the Arcadia address of Zhang and Xuan.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Zhang and Xuan set up the business solely to find surrogates for themselves. State records show the company terminated its business license in June.",
      "Wald said there are no special licensing requirements in California for businesses that match surrogates with intended parents.",
      "Wald said there should have been plenty of checks and balances in the process, noting the role of fertility clinics in handling embryos.",
      "\u201cThe first place typically is the matching program that matches the surrogate with an intended parent. But in this situation the intended parents were the matching program,\u201d Wald said. \u201cI am not familiar with any other prior case where that was true.\u201d",
      "Arcadia police said the six children who were not at the couple's home were found with family friends. The couple's house was \u201cset up for a school environment,\u201d Lt. Kollin Cieadlo said.",
      "Zhang and Xuan were accused of neglect and arrested in May. Charges were not formally pursued at that time in order for an abuse investigation to continue, and detectives now believe there were other instances of abuse, Cieadlo said.",
      "A 2-month-old infant with a traumatic head injury, allegedly at the hands of a nanny, remains in a hospital in stable condition, he said.",
      "California law requires child welfare agencies to prioritize placing children who cannot safely be with their parents in homes with extended family, and requires siblings to be kept together unless it would endanger the child to do so, said Leslie Heimov, the executive director of the Children\u2019s Law Center of California.",
      "The Children\u2019s Law Center has worked with some families with 10 to 12 children, Heimov said. A family with 20 children or more is \u201cunusual,\" she added.",
      "It\u2019s more complicated to find foster homes for larger families that can accommodate all the children\u2019s needs, especially for infants, Heimov said.",
      "In addition to expenses and limited space, it's hard to give infants the proper stimulation and care they need if they are in a home with many other children, she said.",
      "In cases involving many children, the state will sometimes get creative to make sure that siblings can maintain relationships with each other, like placing them in the same neighborhood, or placing them in different but related households, Heimov said.",
      "A case involving over 20 children conceived through surrogacy would \u201cpresent some legal questions,\u201d said Heimov. \u201cBut it would not change our advocacy \u2014 we want every child we represent to be in a loving, safe home.\"",

      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency",
      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what's called chronic venous insufficiency. It's a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. Here are some things to know.",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, happens when veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart. That can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger leg sores known as ulcers.",
      "Overcoming gravity to pump blood from the feet all the way up to the heart is a challenge, especially when someone is standing or sitting for long periods. So legs veins are lined with one-way valves that keep blood from sliding backward on that journey. Anything that damages those valves can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors can include blood clots, vein inflammation known as phlebitis or being overweight.",
      "Doctors must rule out serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart problems, kidney disease or blood clots. Ultrasound exams of the leg veins can help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According to the Cleveland Clinic, treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking, is recommended \u2014 because strong leg muscles can squeeze veins in a way that helps them pump blood. Medications and medical procedures are available for more advanced cases.",

    "story": [
      "Researchers report that eight healthy babies were born with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing rare diseases to their children",
      "LONDON -- Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.",
      "Most DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it's that genetic material \u2014 some inherited from mom, some from dad \u2014 that makes us who we are. But there's also some DNA outside of the cell's nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.",
      "Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it's not clear.",
      "Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the first babies had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother's egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.",
      "The latest research \u201cmarks an important milestone,\u201d said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. \u201cExpanding the range of reproductive options \u2026 will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.\u201d",
      "Using this method means the embryo has DNA from three people \u2014 from the mother's egg, the father's sperm and the donor's mitochondria \u2014 and it required a 2016 U.K. law change to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.",
      "Experts at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.",
      "One of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.",
      "Dr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work \u201ca triumph of scientific innovation,\u201d and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.",
      "Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.",
      "\u201cIf you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor \u2026 you will have much more DNA from another person,\u201d he said.",
      "In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country\u2019s fertility regulator. As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the technique.",
      "Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it's impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.",
      "\u201cCurrently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,\" Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. \u201dWhether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.\"",
      "For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, \u201cin which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.\u201d",
      "But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.",
      "Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.",
      "She said the diagnosis \u201cturned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.\u201d Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter\u2019s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s super exciting for families that don\u2019t have much hope in their lives,\u201d Curtis said.",

      "Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand access to the lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies \u2014 advances that could help recover would-be heart donations that too often go unused.",
      "The new research aims to overcome barriers for using organs from someone who dies when their heart stops. Called DCD, or donation after circulatory death, it involves a controversial recovery technique or the use of expensive machines.",
      "Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they\u2019ve separately devised simpler approaches to retrieve those hearts. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts to a 3-month-old infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt.",
      "\u201cThese DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors,\u201d said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.",
      "Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.",
      "Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn\u2019t ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.",
      "To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor\u2019s abdominal and chest organs \u2014 after clamping off access to the brain. But it\u2019s ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.",
      "Another option is to \u201creanimate\u201d DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke\u2019s Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can\u2019t be used for young children\u2019s small hearts \u2014 the age group with the most dire need.",
      "Turek\u2019s team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function \u2014 not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.",
      "They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate \u2014 and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn\u2019t allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek\u2019s team test the experimental alternative.",
      "It took just five minutes to tell \u201cthe coronary arteries are filling well, it\u2019s pink, it\u2019s beating,\u201d Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.",
      "Vanderbilt\u2019s system is even simpler: Infuse the heart with a nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing it from the donor\u2019s body, similar to how hearts from brain-dead donors are handled.",
      "That \u201creplenishes the nutrients that are depleted during the dying process and helps protect it for transport,\u201d Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt has performed about 25 such transplants so far. \u201cOur view is you don\u2019t necessarily need to reanimate the heart.\u201d",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure, yet many are never even offered a transplant because of the organ shortage.",
      "Every year about 700 children in the U.S. are added to the transplant list for a new heart and about 20% die waiting. Turek said infants are at particular risk.",
      "Last year, people whose lives ended via circulatory death made up 43% of the nation\u2019s deceased donors \u2014 but just 793 of the 4,572 heart transplants.",
      "That's why many specialists say finding ways to use more of those hearts is crucial. The new studies are small and early-stage but promising, said Brendan Parent of NYU Langone Health, who directs transplant ethics and policy research.",
      "\u201cInnovation to find ways to recover organs successfully after circulatory death are essential for reducing the organ shortage,\u201d he said.",
      "If alternatives pan out, \u201cI absolutely think that cardiac programs will be thrilled, especially at hospitals that have rejected NRP.\u201d",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- For decades, proponents of psychedelic drugs have come to Washington with a provocative message: Illegal, mind-altering substances like LSD and ecstasy should be approved for Americans grappling with depression, trauma and other hard-to-treat conditions.",
      "A presidential administration finally seems to agree.",
      "\u201cThis line of therapeutics has tremendous advantage if given in a clinical setting and we are working very hard to make sure that happens within 12 months,\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told members of Congress.",
      "His suggested timeline for green-lighting psychedelic therapy surprised even the most bullish supporters of the drugs. And it comes as psychedelics are making inroads in deep red states like Texas, where former Trump cabinet secretary and ex-governor Rick Perry has thrown his full support behind the effort.",
      "The administration's embrace of psychedelics has sparked both excitement as well as concern from those in the field, who worry the drugs might be discredited if they appear to be rushed onto the market or are too closely linked with Kennedy, who is known for controversial views on vaccines, antidepressants and fluoride.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic,\u201d says Rick Doblin, whose organization has pursed the medical use of MDMA (or ecstasy) since the 1980s. \u201cBut I\u2019m also worried that the message the public might get is \u2018Well, RFK likes psychedelics and now it\u2019s approved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Under President Joe Biden, the FDA rejected MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, citing flawed data and questionable research. Regulators called for a new study, likely taking several years. It was a major setback for Doblin and other advocates hoping to see the first U.S. approval of a psychedelic for medical use.",
      "But the agency appears ready to reconsider. FDA chief Marty Makary, who reports to Kennedy, has called the evaluation of MDMA and other psychedelics \u201ca top priority,\u201d announcing a slate of initiatives that could be used to accelerate their approval.",
      "One new program promises to expedite drugs that serve \u201cthe health interests of Americans,\u201d by slashing their review time from six months or more to as little as one month. Makary has also suggested greater flexibility on requirements for certain drugs, potentially waiving rigorous controlled studies that compare patients to a placebo group.",
      "That approach, considered essential for high-quality research, has long been a stumbling point for psychedelic studies, in which patients can almost always correctly guess whether they\u2019ve received the drug or a dummy pill.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and FDA also recently hired several new staffers with ties to the psychedelic movement.",
      "\u201cThese are all very promising signs that the administration is aware of the potential of psychedelics and is trying to make overtures that they\u2019re ready to approve them,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a fellow at the libertarian Reason Foundation, who also consults for psychedelic companies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything about that in the Biden administration\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "As a presidential candidate, Kennedy discussed how his son and several close friends benefited from using psychedelics to deal with grief and other issues.",
      "A number of veterans lobbying for psychedelic access have already met with Trump's Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing so far is positive,\u201d Collins told House lawmakers in May.",
      "But some experts worry the hope and hype surrounding psychedelics has gotten ahead of the science.",
      "Philip Corlett, a psychiatric researcher at Yale University, says bypassing rigorous clinical trials could set back the field and jeopardize patients.",
      "\"If RFK and the new administration are serious about this work, there are things they could do to shepherd it into reality by meeting the benchmarks of medical science,\" Corlett said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "As officials in Washington weigh the future of psychedelics, some states are moving ahead with their own projects in hopes of nudging the federal government. Oregon and Colorado have legalized psychedelic therapy.",
      "And last month, Texas approved $50 million to study ibogaine, a potent psychedelic made from a shrub that's native to West Africa, as a treatment for opioid addiction, PTSD and other conditions. The research grant \u2014 the largest of its kind by any government \u2014 passed with support from the state's former GOP governor, Perry, and combat veterans, some who have traveled to clinics in Mexico that offer ibogaine.",
      "Ibogaine is on the U.S. government\u2019s ultra-restrictive list of illegal, Schedule 1 drugs, which also includes heroin. So advocates in Texas are hoping to build a national movement to ease restrictions on researching its use.",
      "\u201cGovernmental systems move slowly and inefficiently,\u201d said Bryan Hubbard of Americans for Ibogaine, a group formed with Perry. \u201cSometimes you find yourself constrained in terms of the progress you can make from within.\u201d",
      "Ibogaine is unique among psychedelics in both its purported benefits and risks. Small studies and anecdotal reports suggest the drug may be able to dramatically ease addiction and trauma. It was sold for medical use in France for several decades starting in the 1930s, but the drug can also cause dangerous irregular heart rhythms, which can be fatal if left untreated.",
      "Some veterans who have taken the drug say the risks can be managed and ibogaine\u2019s healing properties go far beyond antidepressants, mood stabilizers, counseling and other standard treatments.",
      "Marcus Capone struggled with anger, insomnia and mood swings after 13 years as a Navy Seal. In 2017, at the urging of his wife Amber, he agreed to try ibogaine as a last resort. He described his first ibogaine session as \u201ca complete purge of everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut afterward I felt the weight just completely off my shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more anxiety, no more depression, life made sense all of a sudden.\u201d",
      "A nonprofit founded by the Capones, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, or VETS, has helped over 1,000 veterans travel abroad to receive ibogaine and other psychedelics.",
      "But federal scientists have looked at the drug before \u2014 three decades ago, when the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded preliminary studies on using it as an addiction treatment. The research was discontinued after it identified \u201ccardiovascular toxicity.\"",
      "\u201cIt would be dead in the water,\u201d in terms of winning FDA approval, longtime NIDA director Nora Volkow said.",
      "But Volkow said her agency remains interested in psychedelics, including ibogaine, and is funding an American drugmaker that's working to develop a safer, synthetic version of the drug.",

    "story": [
      "Dozens of ice cream makers pledged on Monday to remove artificial dyes from their products by 2028",
      "Ice cream makers representing about 90% of the U.S. supply of the frozen treat have pledged to remove artificial dyes from their products in less than three years, federal health officials said Monday.",
      "The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects. In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too.",
      "\u201cThis is a Renaissance moment for health in America,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference.",
      "About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association. The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn't identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering.",
      "The national focus on artificial food dyes is \u201ca good step to take,\" but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\u201cJust taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.\u201d",
      "However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called \u201ca 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.\u201d",
      "The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects\u201d when consuming foods made with them.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.",
      "The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said.",
      "Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that \u201cencourages\u201d them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.",
      "Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won't guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.",
      "\u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d Galligan said. \u201cIt's easy for companies to make promises to look like they're being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "South Africa has played a historic, global role in scientific research, from COVID-19 vaccines to HIV",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Just a week had remained before scientists in South Africa were to begin clinical trials of an HIV vaccine, and hopes were high for another step toward limiting one of history's deadliest pandemics. Then the email arrived.",
      "Stop all work, it said. The United States under the Trump administration was withdrawing all its funding.",
      "The news devastated the researchers, who live and work in a region where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world. Their research project, called BRILLIANT, was meant to be the latest to draw on the region's genetic diversity and deep expertise in the hope of benefiting people everywhere.",
      "But the $46 million from the U.S. for the project was disappearing, part of the dismantling of foreign aid by the world's biggest donor earlier this year as President Donald Trump announced a focus on priorities at home.",
      "South Africa has been hit especially hard because of Trump's baseless claims about the targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority. The country had been receiving about $400 million a year via USAID and the HIV-focused PEPFAR.",
      "Now that's gone.",
      "Glenda Grey, who heads the Brilliant program, said the African continent has been vital to the development of HIV medication, and the U.S. cuts threaten its capability to do such work in the future.",
      "Significant advances have included clinical trials for lenacapavir, the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, recently approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One study to show its efficacy involved young South Africans.",
      "\u201cWe do the trials better, faster and cheaper than anywhere else in the world, and so without South Africa as part of these programs, the world, in my opinion, is much poorer,\u201d Gray said.",
      "She noted that during the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa played a crucial role by testing the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccines, and South African scientists' genomic surveillance led to the identification of an important variant.",
      "A team of researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand has been part of the unit developing the HIV vaccines for the trials.",
      "Inside the Wits laboratory, technician Nozipho Mlotshwa was among the young people in white gowns working on samples, but she may soon be out of a job.",
      "Her position is grant-funded. She uses her salary to support her family and fund her studies in a country where youth unemployment hovers around 46%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and devastating, honestly,\" she said of the U.S. cuts and overall uncertainty. \u201cWe\u2019ll also miss out collaborating with other scientists across the continent.\u201d",
      "Professor Abdullah Ely leads the team of researchers. He said the work had promising results indicating that the vaccines were producing an immune response.",
      "But now that momentum, he said, has \u201call kind of had to come to a halt.\u201d",
      "The BRILLIANT program is scrambling to find money to save the project. The purchase of key equipment has stopped. South Africa's health department says about 100 researchers for that program and others related to HIV have been laid off. Funding for postdoctoral students involved in experiments for the projects is at risk.",
      "South Africa's government has estimated that universities and science councils could lose about $107 million in U.S. research funding over the next five years due to the aid cuts, which affect not only work on HIV but also tuberculosis \u2014 another disease with a high number of cases in the country.",
      "South Africa\u2019s government has said it will be very difficult to find funding to replace the U.S. support.",
      "And now the number of HIV infections will grow. Medication is more difficult to obtain. At least 8,000 health workers in South Africa's HIV program have already been laid off, the government has said. Also gone are the data collectors who tracked patients and their care, as well as HIV counselors who could reach vulnerable patients in rural communities.",
      "For researchers, Universities South Africa, an umbrella body, has applied to the national treasury for over $110 million for projects at some of the largest schools.",
      "During a visit to South Africa in June, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima was well aware of the stakes, and the lives at risk, as research and health care struggle in South Africa and across Africa at large.",
      "Other countries that were highly dependent on U.S. funding including Zambia, Nigeria, Burundi and Ivory Coast are already increasing their own resources, she said.",
      "\u201cBut let\u2019s be clear, what they are putting down will not be funding in the same way that the American resources were funding,\" Byanyima said.",

      "BEIJING -- China\u2019s Education Ministry issued a safety warning for Chinese students in the Philippines after what it said were a series of criminal incidents targeting them.",
      "The brief warning Friday did not identify any specific incidents but told students to increase their safety awareness should they choose to study in the Philippines. The number of Chinese students in the country was not given but enrolments have fallen to just a few hundred in recent years, according to the Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post.",
      "Relations between the governments of China and the Philippines are particularly tense due to disputes over maritime claims in the South China Sea, which China claims almost in its entirety. China has used water cannons and other non-lethal shipboard deterrents to drive off Philippine fishing boats.",
      "Undersecretary Claire Castro of the Presidential Communications Office said on Friday that China has the right to issue such an advisory but underscored that the crime rate in the Philippines has been falling and \u201csafety and security in the Philippines, we can say, have been improving as far as we are concerned.\u201d",
      "Police response to public concerns over crime has been fast. Crimes sparked by Chinese online gambling have declined or have been eradicated and many Chinese suspects have been deported by the Philippines, Castro told a daily news briefing.",
      "In February a 14-year-old Chinese student was kidnapped in Manila by a Chinese-led gang, which killed his driver and cut off the student\u2019s finger in a bid to force his parents to pay a huge ransom. The Philippine interior secretary said the student\u2019s family and the Chinese leader of the kidnappers were allegedly former operators of lucrative online gambling outfits.",
      "Politically, China has dismissed a U.N.-backed court decision in The Hague that ruled out most of China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea and has expressed resentment over close ties between the U.S. and Manila.",
      "China often disrupts cultural and economic ties to register their discontent over actions by foreign governments.",
      "In April, China issued a similar warning about the risk to Chinese students in the United States.",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Three Polish doctors were convicted for their roles in the 2021 death of a 30-year-old pregnant woman that sparked massive protests, Polish news agency PAP reported.",
      "The death from sepsis of the woman known as Iza at a hospital in southern Poland in her 22nd week of pregnancy led to huge street protests against the country\u2019s restrictive anti-abortion law. Activists blamed her death on doctors\u2019 choice to \u201cwait and see\u201d rather than immediately carry out an abortion because of the Poland\u2019s near-ban on the procedure.",
      "Two of the doctors were sentenced to more than a year in prison without parole and the third received a two-year suspended sentence, PAP reported Thursday. They can appeal the decision.",
      "The charges, filed in 2022, were of exposing the patient to the danger of loss of life. Two of the doctors also were charged with unintentionally causing the patient\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cAs a result of the team\u2019s activity and the failure to act, the patient has died,\u201d Agnieszka Wichary, spokesperson for the prosecutors\u2019 office in Katowice, said in a statement at the time.",
      "Poland, a mostly Catholic country, passed a strict law in 1993 that banned abortions except when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, when the woman\u2019s life or health is at risk, or when the fetus had congenital deformities.",
      "But the Constitutional Tribunal, under the influence of Poland\u2019s conservative ruling party, ruled in 2020 that abortions for congenital defects were not constitutional, even if the fetus has no chance of survival. That sparked huge street protests.",
      "Activists said Iza was the first to die from the further tightening of the restrictive law. The woman left behind a husband and a daughter.",
      "In practice, activists say, many women have abortions on their own with pills obtained from abroad.",

      "In cell phone messages to The Associated Press on Thursday, Mdluli said it wasn't clear how long that would take.",
      "The men, who the U.S. says were convicted of serious crimes and were in the U.S. illegally, are citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos. Their convictions included murder and child rape, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said, describing them as \"uniquely barbaric.\"",
      "Their deportations were announced by Homeland Security on Tuesday and mark the continuation of President Donald Trump's plan to send deportees to third countries they have no ties with after it was stalled by a legal challenge in the United States.",
      "Here's what we know and don't know about the deportations:",
      "Eswatini, a country of 1.2 million people bordering South Africa, is the latest nation to accept third-country deportees from the U.S. The Trump administration has sent hundreds of Venezuelans and others to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama, and deported eight men earlier this month to South Sudan, also an African country.",
      "The deportees to South Sudan are citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan. They were held for weeks in a converted shipping container at a U.S. military base in the nearby country of Djibouti until a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for them to be finally sent to South Sudan. The U.S. also described them as violent criminals.",
      "Eswatini's government confirmed on Wednesday that the latest five deportees were in its custody after landing on a deportation plane from the U.S.",
      "Local media reported they are being held at the Matsapha Correctional Complex, outside the country's administrative capital of Mbabane, which includes Eswatini's top maximum-security prison.",
      "The Eswatini government said the men are \u201cin transit\u201d and will eventually be sent to their home countries. The U.S. and Eswatini governments would work with the U.N. migration agency to do that, it said.",
      "The U.N. agency \u2014 the International Organization for Migration or IOM \u2014 said it was not involved in the operation and has not been approached to assist in the matter but would be willing to help \u201cin line with its humanitarian mandate.\u201d",
      "Eswatini's statement that the men would be sent home was in contrast to U.S. claims they were sent to Eswatini because their home countries refused to take them back.",
      "It's unclear how sending the men to Eswatini would make it easier for them to be deported home. There was also no timeframe for that as it depends on several factors, including engagements with the IOM, Mdluli said.",
      "\u201cWe are not yet in a position to determine the timelines for the repatriation,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Four of the five countries where the men are from have historically resisted taking back some of their citizens deported from the U.S., which has been a reoccurring problem for Homeland Security. Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the administration was happy the men were \u201coff of American soil\u201d when she announced their deportations.",
      "There have been no details on why Eswatini agreed to take the men and Mdluli, the government spokesperson, said \"the terms of the agreement between the U.S. and Eswatini remain classified.\u201d",
      "Eswatini has said it was the result of months of negotiations between the two governments. South Sudan has also given no details of its agreement with the U.S. to take deportees and has declined to say where the eight men sent there are being held.",
      "Some analysts say African nations might be willing to take deportees from the U.S. in return for more favorable relations with the Trump administration, which has cut foreign aid to poor countries and threatened them with trade tariffs.",
      "The Trump administration has also said it's seeking more deportation deals with other countries.",
      "Rights groups have questioned the countries the U.S. has chosen to deal with, as South Sudan and Eswatini have both been criticized for having repressive governments.",
      "Eswatini is Africa's only absolute monarchy, meaning the king has power over government and rules by decree. Political parties are banned and pro-democracy protests have been quelled violently in the past.",
      "Several rights groups have criticized Eswatini since pro-democracy protests erupted there in 2021, citing deadly crackdowns by security forces and abusive conditions in prisons, including at the Matsapha Correctional Complex, where pro-democracy activists are held.",

      "Members of Syria's Druze community are searching for loved ones and counting their dead after days of clashes in a southern province that left bloodied bodies of civilians on the streets and homes looted",
      "JARAMANA, Syria -- A Syrian Druze woman living in the United Arab Emirates frantically tried to keep in touch with her family in her hometown in southern Syria as clashes raged there over the past days.",
      "Her mother, father and sister sent videos of their neighbors fleeing as fighters moved in. The explosions from shelling were non-stop, hitting near their house. Her family took shelter in the basement. When she reached them later in a video call, they said her father was missing. He had gone out during a lull to check the situation and never returned.",
      "\u201cNow I only pray. That\u2019s all I can do,\" she told The Associated Press at the time.",
      "Hours later, they learned he had been shot and killed by a sniper. The woman spoke on condition of anonymity fearing that using her name would put her surviving family and friends at risk.",
      "A ceasefire went into effect late Wednesday, easing days of brutal clashes in Sweida. Now, members of its Druze community who fled or went into hiding are returning to search for loved ones and count their losses. They are finding homes looted and bloodied bodies of civilians in the streets.",
      "The fighting began with tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between local Sunni Bedouin tribes and Druze militias in the majority-Druze Sweida province. Government forces that intervened to restore order clashed with the Druze militias, but also in some cases attacked civilians.",
      "At least 600 people \u2014 combatants and civilians on both sides \u2014 were killed in four days of clashes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor. It said the dead included more than 80 civilians, mostly Druze, who were rounded up by fighters and collectively shot to death in what the monitor called \u201cfield executions.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese are not individual acts but systemic,\u201d the Observatory\u2019s director Rami Abdul-Rahman told the AP. \u201cAll the violations are there. You can see from the bodies that are all over the streets in Sweida clearly show they\u2019re shot in the head.\u201d",
      "In response, Druze militias have targeted Bedouin families in revenge attacks since the ceasefire was reached. Footage shared on Syrian state media shows Bedouin families putting their belongings in trucks and fleeing with reports of renewed skirmishes in those areas. There was no word on casualties in those attacks.",
      "Most of the Syrian Druze who spoke to the AP requested anonymity, fearing they and their families could be targeted.",
      "The Druze religious sect is an offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. More than half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. The others live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",
      "They largely celebrated the downfall in December of Syrian autocrat Bashar Assad but were divided over interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa\u2019s Sunni Islamist rule. The latest violence has left the community more skeptical of Syria\u2019s new leadership and doubtful of peaceful coexistence.",
      "One Syrian-American Druze told the AP of his fear as he watched the clashes from the United States and tried to account for his family and friends whom he had seen in a recent trip to his native city Sweida.",
      "Despite internet and communications breakdowns, he tracked down his family. His mother and brother fled because their home was shelled and raided, he said. Their belongings were stole, windows shattered. Their neighbors\u2019 house was burned down. Two other neighbors were killed, one by shelling, another by stray bullets, he said.",
      "He also pored over online videos of the fighting, finding a harrowing footage.",
      "It showed gunmen in military uniform forcing a number of men in civilian clothes to kneel in the street in a well-known roundabout in Sweida. The gunmen then spray the men with automatic fire, their bodies dropping to the ground. The footage was seen by the AP.",
      "To his horror, he recognized the men. One was a close family friend \u2014 another Syrian American on a visit to Sweida from the U.S. The others were the friend\u2019s brother, father, three uncles and a cousin. Friends he reached told him that government forces had raided the house where they were all staying and took them outside and shot them.",
      "\u201cWe affirm that protecting your rights and freedoms is among our top priorities,\u201d al-Sharaa said in a speech broadcast Thursday, where he addressed the Druze people in Syria, promising to hold perpetrators of civilian killings to account.",
      "But some rights groups accused Syria\u2019s interim government of systematic sectarian violence, similar to that inflicted on the Alawite religious minority in the coastal province of Latakia in the aftermath of Assad's fall as the new government tried to quell a counterinsurgency there.",
      "Footage widely circulated on social media showed some of the carnage. One video shows a living room with several bodies on the floor and bullet holes in the walls and sofa.",
      "In another, there are at least nine bloodied bodies in one room of the home of a family that took in people fleeing the fighting. Portraits of Druze notables are visible, smashed on the floor.",
      "Evelyn Azzam, a Druze woman, is searching the Damascus suburb of Jaramana, trying to find out what happened to her husband, Robert Kiwan.",
      "Last week, the 23-year-old Kiwan left home in Jaramana early as he does every day to commute to his job in Sweida.",
      "He got caught up in the chaos when the clashes erupted. Azzam was on the phone with him as government forces questioned him and his coworkers. She heard a gunshot when one of the coworkers raised his voice. She heard her husband trying to appeal to the soldiers.",
      "\u201cHe was telling them that they are from the Druze of Sweida, but have nothing to do with the armed groups,\u201d the 20-year-old Azzam said.",
      "Then she heard another gunshot; her husband was shot in the hip. An ambulance took him to a hospital, where she later learned he underwent an operation. But she hasn\u2019t heard anything since and doesn\u2019t know if he survived.",
      "Back in the U.S., the Syrian-American said he was relieved that his family is safe but the video of his friend\u2019s family being gunned down in the street filled him with \u201cdisbelief, betrayal, rage.\u201d",
      "He said his family and friends protested against Assad, celebrated his downfall and wanted to give al-Sharaa\u2019s rule a chance. He said he hadn\u2019t wanted to believe that the new Syrian army \u2014 which emerged from al-Sharaa\u2019s insurgent forces \u2014 was made up of Islamic militants.",
      "But after the violence in Latakia and now in Sweida, he sees the new army as a \u201cbunch of militias \u2026 with a huge majority being radicals.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a world where I would be able to go back and integrate with these monsters,\u201d he said.",

      "BERLIN -- Germany deported dozens of Afghan men to their homeland on Friday, the second time it has done so since the Taliban returned to power and the first since a new government pledging a tougher line on migration took office in Berlin.",
      "German authorities said a flight took off Friday morning carrying 81 Afghans, all of them men who had previously come to judicial authorities' attention and had had asylum applications rejected.",
      "Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the deportation was carried out with the help of Qatar and preceded by weeks of negotiations. He also said there were contacts with Afghanistan, but didn\u2019t elaborate.",
      "More than 10 months ago, Germany's previous government deported Afghan nationals to their homeland for the first time since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Then-Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed to step up deportations of asylum-seekers.",
      "Merz noted that, while diplomatic relations between Germany and Afghanistan have not formally been broken off, Berlin doesn't recognize the Taliban government in Kabul.",
      "\u201cThe decisive question is how one deals with this regime, and it will remain at technical coordination until further notice,\u201d he said at a news conference in Berlin.",

      "Merz made tougher migration policy a central plank of his campaign for Germany\u2019s election in February.",
      "Just after he took office in early May, the government stationed more police at the border \u2014 stepping up border checks introduced by the Scholz government \u2014 and said some asylum-seekers trying to enter Europe\u2019s biggest economy would be turned away. It also has suspended family reunions for many migrants.",
      "Asylum applications declined from 329,120 in 2023 to 229,751 last year and have continued to fall this year.",
      "\u201cYou can see from the figures that we are obviously on the right path, but we are not yet at the end of that path,\u201d Merz said.",
      "The Afghan deportation flight took off hours before German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt plans to discuss migration with his counterparts from five neighboring countries \u2014 France, Poland, Austria, Denmark and the Czech Republic \u2014 as well as the European Union's commissioner responsible for migration, Magnus Brunner. Dobrindt is hosting the meeting on the Zugspitze, Germany's highest peak, on the Austrian border.",

      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are signing a treaty Thursday to strengthen defense ties and combat migrant smuggling across the English Channel",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are set to sign a treaty on Thursday pledging to tighten defense ties and step up law-enforcement cooperation against gangs that smuggle migrants across the English Channel.",
      "The center-right German leader is in London on his first official visit to Britain since taking office in May. Starmer visited Berlin in August 2024, announcing plans for the U.K.-Germany \u201cfriendship and cooperation\u201d treaty with Merz\u2019s predecessor, Olaf Scholz.",
      "A priority for Starmer, who heads the center-left Labour Party, is curbing the gangs behind cross-channel people smuggling. About 37,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel from France in small boats in 2024, and more than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of 2025. Dozens of people have died trying to cross.",
      "Berlin agreed last year to make facilitating the smuggling of migrants to the U.K. a criminal offence, a move that will give law enforcements more powers to investigate the supply and storage of small boats to be used for the crossings. Merz is expected to commit to adopting the law change by the end of the year.",
      "\u201cChancellor Merz\u2019s commitment to make necessary changes to German law to disrupt the supply lines of the dangerous vessels which carry illegal migrants across the Channel is hugely welcome,\u201d Starmer said, calling the U.K. and Germany \u201cthe closest of allies.\u201d",
      "Germany and the U.K. \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest and second-largest economies \u2013 are also expected to announce a series of investment deals.",
      "The treaty builds on a defense pact the U.K. and Germany, two of the biggest European supporters of Ukraine, signed last year pledging closer co-operation against a growing threat from Russia. It includes a promise to come to one another\u2019s aid in case of attack.",
      "The two leaders also are expected to agree Thursday to joint export campaigns for jointly produced equipment such as Boxer armored vehicles and Typhoon jets, and to develop a deep precision strike missile in the next decade.",
      "Starmer has worked to improve relations with Britain\u2019s neighbors, strained by the U.K.\u2019s acrimonious departure from the European Union in 2020. He has sought to rebuild ties strained by years of ill-tempered wrangling over Brexit terms. He has ruled out rejoining the 27-nation bloc\u2019s single market or customs union, and has been cool to the idea of a youth mobility agreement with the EU, but has sought to reduce trade barriers and to strengthen defense cooperation.",
      "\u201cI make no secret of the fact I very much regret to this day that Britain left the European Union,\u201d Merz told the German parliament last week. \u201cBut if they at least work together with us again in the area of foreign and security policy, then that is a very good sign. Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants that.\u201d",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A teacher was stabbed and seriously injured at a musical performance by elementary school pupils on Wednesday night, Dutch police said in a statement Thursday. Three suspects were later arrested.",
      "The 53-year-old teacher was stabbed as he tried to intervene in an argument between three men at a cultural center in Alblasserdam, police said, adding that many people witnessed the stabbing and were offered counselling in the immediate aftermath.",
      "Children at elementary schools in the Netherlands traditionally put on shows for their parents in the last week before the summer holidays.",
      "A 44-year-old man was arrested close to the cultural center shortly after the stabbing. Two other men later went to a hospital in nearby Rotterdam. One of them, who had undisclosed injuries, was arrested there. The other man fled but was quickly arrested, police said. The reason for the argument that preceded the stabbing was not immediately clear.",
      "The alleged role of the three men in the stabbing was being investigated. Their identities were not disclosed, in line with Dutch privacy guidelines. Police also impounded two vehicles as part of their investigation.",
      "The incident happened at a musical show put on by final-year students at an elementary school in Alblasserdam, a small town famous for the World Heritage-listed Kinderdijk windmills on the outskirts of the town.",

      "Svyrydenko is one of a group of officials taking on new roles in Ukraine\u2019s government, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reshuffles the Cabinet in a bid to energize a war-weary nation and boost domestic weapons production in the face of Russia\u2019s grinding invasion.",
      "At home, however, the Cabinet recalibration has not been seen as a major shift, as the Ukrainian leader continues to rely on officials who have proven their effectiveness and loyalty during the war, now in its fourth year.",
      "Zelenskyy submitted nominations on Thursday to shuffle top government positions, including the replacement of Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, the longest-serving head of government in Ukraine\u2019s history.",
      "Shmyhal now moves to become defense minister, according to the parliamentary website.",
      "Other changes are expected in the Cabinet, but Svyrydenko\u2019s appointment as prime minister is taking center stage.",
      "She played a key role in negotiating a U.S.\u2013Ukraine mineral agreement, ensuring the terms were acceptable to Kyiv. Svyrydenko has frequently represented Ukraine in high-level talks with Western partners, focusing on defense cooperation, economic recovery and reconstruction.",

      "His new post as defense minister means he is not leaving government entirely, but instead remains in the cabinet in a powerful role. The defense ministry commands one of the largest budgets and carries critical importance because of the war.",
      "Shmyhal will replace Rustem Umerov, who, although he sought to push reforms, saw his tenure marked by internal turbulence and persistent dysfunction in Ukraine\u2019s defense procurement system. Despite his active role on the international stage, critics said the ministry remained plagued by mismanagement.",

      "North Korea says the complex can accommodate nearly 20,000 guests. The resort opened to domestic tourists July 1 before receiving a small group of Russian tourists last week. Observers expected North Korea to open the resort to Chinese tourists while largely blocking other international tourists.",

      "Analyst Lee Sangkeun of Seoul's Institute for National Security Strategy said the ban could be associated with difficulties in recruiting Russian tourists because many would consider North Korea too far away and the trip too expensive.",
      "Experts say North Korea must open the Wonsan-Kalma zone, the country\u2019s biggest tourist complex, to Russian and Chinese tourists, given what was likely a huge construction and operational expenditure from the country\u2019s tight budget.",
      "\u201cIf foreign tourists aren't allowed to the site, no Russian rubles, Chinese yuans and dollars won't come in. Then, North Korea can't break even and it has to shut down the resort,\u201d said Ahn Chan-il, head of the World Institute for North Korean Studies think tank in Seoul.",
      "Kim has said the site would be \u201cone of the greatest successes this year\u201d and \u201cthe proud first step\u201d in tourism development. North Korea\u2019s state media reports the Wonsan-Kalma site has been crowded with local tourists.",

      "Chinese group tours, which made up more than 90% of visitors before the pandemic, remain stalled. In February, North Korea allowed a small group of international tourists to visit the northeastern city of Rason, only to stop the program in less than a month.",

      "BERLIN -- German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday that his coalition has a \u201cstable foundation\u201d and has achieved a lot in its first 10 weeks, but acknowledged that \u201coccasional setbacks\u201d are a risk in government as his administration struggles with its first major dispute.",
      "Merz took office on May 6, leading a coalition of his conservative Union bloc with the center-left Social Democrats that has a relatively thin parliamentary majority. He vowed to strengthen Europe's biggest economy after years of stagnation, enable Germany to build Europe's strongest conventional army and keep the U.S. on board with aid to Ukraine.",

      "Merz said at the German leader's annual summer news conference that he is \u201cvery satisfied with what we have achieved in the first 10 weeks.\u201d",
      "Merz set out to avoid the infighting that plagued ex-Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition, which collapsed in November. However, the new government's record has been overshadowed over the past week by parliament's failure to elect three new justices for Germany's highest court.",
      "Nominations have in the past mostly been approved uneventfully. But planned votes last Friday were scrapped at the last minute after some lawmakers in Merz's bloc balked at a candidate put forward by the Social Democrats.",
      "Opponents of the nominee, law professor Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, have cited her perceived liberal views on issues such as abortion. Leading Social Democrats have been irked by the conservatives' failure to follow through on an agreement on the new justices and have stood by their candidate.",
      "Merz has downplayed the argument and insisted Friday that \u201cthere is no time pressure\" to rush to a solution. And he rejected a suggestion that his coalition is on wobbly ground, with the court nominee flap following its bumpy start when lawmakers needed an unprecedented two rounds of voting to elect Merz as chancellor in May.",
      "\u201cThis government stands on a stable foundation, on a stable majority in the German parliament,\u201d Merz said. \u201cBut you see from these two votes that we are living in very uncertain times, also regarding supposed certainties in the German parliament.\u201d",
      "He said that \u201cwe know what job we have, and high points and successes are part of that as well as occasional setbacks.\u201d",
      "Recent polls have suggested that Merz's coalition has work to do to convince voters. Ratings for the Union and Social Democrats haven't picked up from their lackluster showing in Germany's February election. Surveys show the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany solidifying its strong second place.",

      "Government security forces agreed with some of the Druze factions that they would re-enter the area to impose stability and protect state institutions, according to two Syrian officials who spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Syrian government forces had largely pulled out of the Druze-majority southern province of Sweida after days of clashes with militias linked to the Druze religious minority that threatened to unravel the country\u2019s fragile post-war transition.",
      "The conflict drew airstrikes against Syrian forces by neighboring Israel in defense of the Druze minority before most of the fighting was halted by a truce announced Wednesday that was mediated by the U.S., Turkey and Arab countries. Under that agreement, Druze factions and clerics would be left to maintain internal security in Sweida, Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa said Thursday.",
      "The clashes initially began between Druze militias and local Sunni Muslim Bedouin tribes Sunday before government forces intervened, nominally to restore order, but ended up taking the Bedouins\u2019 side against the Druze. The fighting killed hundreds of people over four days, with allegations that government-affiliated fighters executed Druze civilians and looted and burned homes.",
      "Israel intervened, launching dozens of airstrikes on convoys of government fighters and striking the Syrian Defense Ministry headquarters in central Damascus in a major escalation of its involvement.",
      "The Druze form a substantial community in Israel, where they are seen as a loyal minority and often serve in the Israeli military.",
      "After the ceasefire and withdrawal of government forces, clashes once again flared between the Druze and Bedouin groups in parts of Sweida province. State media reported Druze militias carried out revenge attacks against Bedouin communities, leading to a wave of displacement.",
      "The governor of neighboring Daraa province said in a statement that more than 1,000 families had been displaced to the area from Sweida as a result of \u201cattacks on Bedouin tribes by outlaw groups.\u201d",
      "The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. More than half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most of the other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",
      "While predominantly Druze, Sweida is also home to Bedouin tribes who are Sunni Muslim and have periodically clashed with the Druze over the years. The latest escalation began with members of a Bedouin tribe in Sweida setting up a checkpoint and attacking and robbing a Druze man, which triggered tit-for-tat attacks and kidnappings.",

      "El Salvador\u2019s top human rights organization, Cristosal, says it is leaving the country after harassment and legal threats by the government of President Nayib Bukele",
      "MEXICO CITY -- El Salvador's top human rights organization, Cristosal, announced Thursday it is leaving the country because of mounting harassment and legal threats by the government of President Nayib Bukele.",
      "The organization has been one of the most visible critics of Bukele, documenting abuses in the strongman\u2019s war on the country\u2019s gangs and the detention of hundreds of Venezuelan deportees in an agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Bukele\u2019s government has long targeted opponents, but Cristosal Executive Director Noah Bullock said things reached a tipping point in recent months as Bukele has grown empowered by his alliance with Trump.",
      "\u201cThe clear targeting of our organization has made us choose between exile or prison,\" Bullock said in an interview with the Associated Press. \u201cThe Bukele administration has unleashed a wave of repression over the past few months ... There's been an exodus of civil society leaders, professionals and even businessmen.\u201d",
      "El Salvador 's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Cristosal has been working in El Salvador since 2000, when it was founded by Evangelical bishops in order to address human rights and democratic concerns following the country\u2019s brutal civil war.",
      "On Thursday, the human rights organization announced that it packed up its offices and moved 20 employees from the Central American nation to neighboring Guatemala and Honduras. Cristosal quietly got staff and their families out before publicly announcing they were leaving out of fear that they could be targeted by the Bukele government.",
      "The decision came after its top anti-corruption lawyer Ruth L\u00f3pez was jailed in June on enrichment charges, which the organization denies.",
      "Cristosal's legal team has supported hundreds of cases alleging the government arbitrarily detained innocent people in its crackdown on gangs, and has unlawfully detained Venezuelans deported from the U.S. L\u00f3pez headed many of those investigations. In a court appearance in June, she appeared shackled and escorted by police.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going to silence me, I want a public trial,\u201d she shouted. \u201cI\u2019m a political prisoner.\u201d",
      "For years, the organization said staff have been followed around by police officers, had their phones tapped by spyware like Pegasus, and been subject to legal attacks and defamation campaigns.",
      "But L\u00f3pez's court appearance was the moment that Bullock said he knew they would have to leave the country.",
      "At the same time, the government has arrested more critics, while others have quietly fled the country. In late May, El Salvador\u2019s Congress passed a \u201cforeign agents\u201d law, championed by the populist president. It resembles legislation implemented by governments in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, Belarus and China to silence and criminalize dissent by exerting pressure on organizations that rely on overseas funding.",
      "Bullock said the the law would make it easier for the government to criminalize staff and cripple the organization economically.",
      "Cristosal's flight from the country marks another blow to checks and balances in a country where Bukele has virtually consolidated control of the government. Bullock said no longer being able to work in the country will make it significantly harder for the organization to continue their ongoing legal work, particularly supporting those detained with little access to due process.",

      "Masai Ujiri is staying focused on his upcoming Giants of Africa Festival even as the longtime NBA executive navigates his recent departure from the Toronto Raptors",
      "NEW YORK -- Masai Ujiri's July is shaping up to be quite the rollercoaster ride. The recently-fired former Toronto Raptors executive is navigating his sudden departure from a franchise where he'd spent 13 seasons while also launching the second edition of his private foundation's Giants of Africa Festival \u2014 all within a one-month span.",
      "The humanitarian work, Ujiri pledged, will continue regardless of his employment status. The British-born NBA executive, raised in his father's native Nigeria, founded Giants of Africa in 2003 \u2014 back when he was just starting off as a scout and long before becoming the first African team president of a professional North American sports franchise.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an obligation for me,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cIt\u2019s a passion.\u201d",
      "The foundation's ambitions have risen with his own success. Giants of Africa has reached thousands of campers across 18 countries. It has helped build more than three dozen courts on the continent. High-profile supporters include Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's The Archewell Foundation. 2023\u2019s inaugural Giants of Africa Festival united more than 250 boys and girls around a week of basketball clinics, life skills lessons and community building that culminated in a concert headlined by South African superstar Tyla. The goal? A \u201cborderless Africa\u201d as Ujiri likes to say.",
      "The festival returns to Kigali, Rwanda, on July 26 with a lineup featuring Nigerian pop singer Ayra Starr and WNBA great Candace Parker. Two-time NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard \u2014 brought to Toronto by Ujiri for the team's championship-winning 2018-2019 season \u2014 will mentor campers and train underserved youth.",
      "Ujiri discussed the upcoming event, and his future, with The Associated Press. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "A: When we had the last festival, we really focused on \u2014 whether it was the basketball, the life skills, the coaching, the mentorship \u2014 we focused on culture. We focused on the whole ecosystem of how we feel kids need this opportunity to grow. It really inspired us to think about how we bring this to more countries.",
      "We\u2019re doing this incredible, incredible fashion show showing the print, the threads of Africa, and who we really are. It used to be weird where you\u2019d see somebody wearing cloth from Africa. Now it\u2019s part of the fashion. It\u2019s part of us. It\u2019s just like Afrobeats \u2014 it\u2019s part of life everywhere. Everybody wants to wear a boubou. You see a lot of fashion designers from all over the world using our prints. We want to showcase that and give these youth the opportunity to see that this is how they can also expand their minds.",
      "A: It's been unbelievable. With these camps, it started off as basketball development, but you've seen that really become something that has really grown even bigger. I saw Pascal (Siakam), I saw (Joel) Embiid, I saw all these guys as youth in camps. Seeing them as 15-, 16-year-old kids in camp, you can't even project. And that tells you how much talent we have on the continent. I always say Africa's biggest jewel is the talent of the youth. One out of every four people in the world are going to be Africans by the year 2050 and the median age is 20. We should be investing on the continent.",
      "A: I'm the prime example of that. I didn't play in the NBA. I didn't even play high-level college or high-level Europe. The entry point for me was a scout in the NBA. From then on lots of people helped me to create this path that I'm on still. I go back to Basketball Without Borders, when the NBA gave me the opportunity to be a director. That has led to me becoming an executive in the NBA. That's the example I want to give.",
      "That's why we have so many people coming to this festival to really show these kids \u2014 whether it's me or a journalist or a sports doctor or sports lawyer \u2014 there's so many careers. And the start is sports and doing it passionately and doing it well.",
      "A: When I first started, I was doing boys camps. Not every kid is going to make it to the NBA. So we started focusing on life skills. That was teaching respect, honesty, being on time. One of the big focuses was respect for women.",
      "So, I'm challenging these boys but I'm not challenging myself. I can't say \u201cwomen's empowerment\u201d and \u201crespect women\u201d and just do these camps for boys. So, we introduced the girls. And it's not 50 boys and 10 girls just for token. It's equality. They all have a basketball and they have the same court time. We can't just say it. We actually have to do it.",
      "A: Job, no job, wherever I am, whatever kind of job I'm doing, Giants of Africa is key. The focus will always be that just because I owe it to the youth of the continent. I owe it to the continent. My goal is not how big does Giants of Africa get. I look at it as: how big are these youth going to become? They'll go on to do other things. They could go on to become a president or become a governor or become president of a team. The hope is that this experience here will even make them reimagine many of the things that they want to do. So, Giants of Africa will never go anywhere.",

      "From crypto coins to bibles, overseas development deals to an upcoming line of cellphones, Trump family businesses have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars since his election",
      "WASHINGTON -- If one theme has emerged in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, it's this: He's leveraged the power of his office for personal gain unlike anyone before in history.",
      "From crypto coins to bibles, overseas development deals to an upcoming line of cellphones, Trump family businesses have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars since his election, an unprecedented flood of often shadowy money from billionaires, foreign governments and cryptocurrency tycoons with interests before the federal government.",
      "\u201cHe is president and is supposed to be working in the public\u2019s interest,\u201d said James Thurber, an emeritus professor at American University, who has researched lobbying, campaign finance and political corruption for decades. \u201cInstead, he is helping his own personal interest to grow his wealth. It\u2019s totally not normal.\u201d",
      "The sums amassed by the Trump Organization, the collection of companies controlled by the president\u2019s children, are far greater than those collected by the family during the president\u2019s first term, when patronage of his hotels, resorts and golf courses was de rigueur to curry favor with the famously transactional commander-in-chief.",
      "The second time around, the Trump family\u2019s ambitions are far grander, stretching from cyberspace to far-flung regions across the globe. One of Trump\u2019s cryptocurrencies is conservatively estimated to have pulled in at least $320 million since January, while another received a $2 billion investment from a foreign government wealth fund. A third has sold at least $550 million in tokens.",
      "His sons have jetted across the Middle East to line up new development deals, while his daughter and son-in-law are working with the Albanian government to build a Mediterranean island resort. Even first lady Melania Trump has inked a $40 million documentary deal with Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, was a frequent target of Trump during his first presidency and whose companies contract extensively with the federal government.",
      "The dealmaking is a rejection of Trump\u2019s first-term pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington and dwarfs the influence peddling efforts of former President Joe Biden\u2019s family, whom Trump and his allies attacked as the \u201cBiden Crime Family.\u201d",
      "While Democrats have condemned Trump for his overlapping roles as a beneficiary and president, he is not likely to face any immediate repercussions for such extensive conflicts-of-interest. Congress is controlled by fellow Republicans, and his administration is stocked with loyalists who have dismantled many guardrails of oversight. Last summer, the Supreme Court, with a conservative majority cemented by Trump, ruled that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.",
      "Even in the rare cases where Trump\u2019s allies have urged caution, the president has ignored them. That\u2019s what happened when he accepted a $400 million \u201cbeautiful, big, magnificent, free airplane\u201d from the Qatari government. Trump said the Boeing 747 \u201cwould go directly\u201d to his presidential library upon leaving office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mount Everest of corruption\u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Since Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace, presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid the appearance of such conflicts.",
      "Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan kept assets in a \u201cblind trust,\u201d while George H.W. Bush used a \u201cdiversified trust,\u201d which blocked him from knowing what was in his portfolio. His son, George W. Bush, used a similar arrangement.",
      "Barack Obama was an exception, but his investments were mostly a bland mix of index funds and U.S. treasuries. During his first term, Trump even gave a nod toward ethics. He issued a moratorium on foreign deals. But instead of placing his assets in a blind trust like many of his predecessors, he handed the reins of the Trump Organization to his children, which kept his financial holdings close.",
      "This time, he has made no such gesture. His sons, Eric and Donald Jr., are again running the business while Trump is in office. And though the White House says he is not involved in its day-to-day decisions, the trust he has established continues to profit. He promotes his resorts, merchandise and the family\u2019s crypto ventures while residing in the White House, often from his account on Truth Social, the social media company he and his allies launched.",
      "He\u2019s also touted a line of Trump shoes, a Bible, which is made in China, and Trump guitars, one of which is a $1,500 Gibson Les Paul knockoff, featuring \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d fret inlays. Conservative groups and Republican committees have spent at least $25 million at Trump properties since 2015, with most of it coming from Trump\u2019s own political organization, campaign finance disclosures show.",
      "Yet, those ventures pale in comparison to his exploits in cryptocurrency, which offers perhaps the clearest example of the conflicts of interest that have come to dominate Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Trump was once a crypto skeptic who declared that cryptocurrencies were \u201cnot money,\u201d were based on \u201cthin air\u201d and seemed \u201clike a scam.\u201d By the time he was running again for president, however, he\u2019d become a proponent of the industry.",
      "\u201cThe difference now is he has realized that it can be his scam,\u201d said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in banking and cryptocurrencies.",
      "Trump has pledged to turn the U.S. into the \u201ccrypto capital of the world\u201d and promised to roll back oversight of the industry.",
      "Deregulation, of course, will help his own businesses. At the height of the campaign, Trump announced the launch of his own crypto coin and World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm that would be run by his sons and several business associates. Among those partners was Steve Witkoff, now one of Trump\u2019s top diplomatic envoys.",
      "The Trump Organization and World Liberty Financial declined to comment.",
      "But it was also rooted in his 2024 campaign. At a crypto event at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in May 2024, he received assurances that industry figures would spend lavishly to get him reelected, The Associated Press previously reported.",
      "Asked recently at the White House if he'd consider having his family business step back from its crypto investments to avoid questions about conflicts of interest, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ve created a very powerful industry. That\u2019s much more important than anything that we invest in.\"",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care about investing. You know, I have kids and they invest in it, because they do believe in it,\" Trump added of crypto. \"But I\u2019m president, and what I did do there was build an industry that\u2019s very important. And, if we didn\u2019t have it, China would.\u201d",
      "Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, reiterated that Trump's crypto boosterism isn't driven by self-interest.",
      "He \u201cis taking decisive action to establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology and to secure America\u2019s position as the world\u2019s leader in the digital asset economy,\u201d Fields said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration,\" Fields added, \"is fulfilling the president\u2019s promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the planet by driving innovation and economic opportunity for all Americans.\u201d",
      "Trump is soon expected to sign cryptocurrency legislation approved by Congress on Thursday. Among the provisions is a ban on members of Congress issuing their own brand of a particular type of cryptocurrency. The prohibition does not extend to the president.",
      "Fields said it was unfair to equate critics\u2019 charges of conflicts of interest against Trump with the president\u2019s own suggestions that Biden\u2019s family benefited financially while he was in office.",
      "He said Trump\u2019s policies haven\u2019t benefited the president personally and have nothing to do with his family\u2019s financial concerns \u2014 and said Trump entered the White House an already successful businessman who didn\u2019t need a political career to become rich.",
      "Even so, Trump\u2019s family is poised to benefit financially from the crypto industry\u2019s growing clout. It holds a majority ownership stake that entitles them to 75% of earnings from their first coin, released last September, according to World Liberty Financial\u2019s website.",
      "The coin, $WLFI, was not an immediate success. Then, after the president's election, sales took off.",
      "Days before his inauguration, Trump announced a new meme coin, $Trump, during the \u201cCrypto Ball,\u201d a Washington gala intended to showcase a regulatory sea change he vowed to usher in.",
      "\u201cTime to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!\u201d Trump posted to his X account. \u201cJoin my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW.\u201d",
      "Often created as a joke with no real utility, meme coins are prone to wild price swings that often enrich a small group of insiders at the expense of less sophisticated investors. $Trump soared to over $70, but its price soon collapsed, losing money for many. It has hovered around $10 since March. Trump did well, though. By the end of April, the coin had earned over $320 million in fees, according to an analysis by the crypto tracking firm Chainalysis.",
      "A third cryptocurrency, a \u201cstablecoin\u201d called USD1, launched in April.",
      "There appear to be upsides for Trump\u2019s cryptocurrency investors and associates.",
      "Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire, has disclosed investing nearly $200 million in the Trumps' various crypto ventures. Amid this spree, the Trump administration announced it had paused a securities fraud case against him. In June, Sun announced he was taking his crypto company, Tron, public after securing financing through a deal brokered by Eric Trump. Last week, Sun posted on Twitter that he was purchasing an additional $100 million worth of Trump's meme coin.",
      "Sun is not the only one. Changpen Zhao, a convicted felon who founded the crypto exchange Binance, was part of a megadeal in which a United Arab Emirates-controlled wealth fund invested $2 billion in the Trump stablecoin, USD1, which it used to purchase a stake in Zhao\u2019s Binance.",
      "The deal gave outsized publicity to World Liberty Financial and instantly made the stablecoin one of the top in the market. It will also allow the Trump family and their business partners to reinvest the $2 billion and collect interest, estimated to be worth as much as $80 million a year.",
      "Soon after the purchase was announced, Trump granted the UAE greater access to U.S. artificial intelligence chips, which it had long sought. Binance and Zhao benefited, too.",
      "Binance is restricted in the U.S. and entered a settlement with the Biden administration that sent Zhao to jail in 2024 after he pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an anti-money-laundering program. Prosecutors said he looked the other way as criminals used his platform to move money connected to child sex abuse, drug trafficking and terrorism.",

      "That fueled a temporary rise in the coin's value. It also helped enrich the Trump Organization, which is entitled to collect fees when the coin is traded. A month later, Trump addressed attendees of the dinner, standing before a lectern with the presidential seal. The White House said at the time that it had nothing to do with the meme coin.",
      "For decades, campaign contributions and lobbying have been governed by laws that place limits on how much donors can give, require a degree of transparency and limit how politicians can spend the money they raise. Trump\u2019s venture into cryptocurrency effectively sidesteps these laws, legal and finance experts say.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot like the Trump Hotel from the first term, but what crypto has done is dispensed with the need for the hotel,\u201d said Allen, the law professor. \u201cBecause crypto assets can be made out of thin air, he has found a way of creating an unlimited supply of assets to offer to people who want to give.\u201d",

      "A new AP-NORC poll shows that while Republican elected officials are promoting their recently passed tax and spending bill as a win for working Americans, everyday Americans broadly see it as a win for the wealthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "Republican elected officials are promoting their recently passed tax and spending bill as a win for working Americans, but a new survey shows that Americans broadly see it as a win for the wealthy.",
      "About two-thirds of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most \u2014 about 6 in 10 \u2014 think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people. About half say it will do more harm than good for middle-class people and people like them.",
      "Republicans have already begun airing advertisements framing the legislation as a tax cut for all Americans, highlighting new deductions on tips and overtime income. But Democrats have been making the case that the wealthiest Americans will benefit from the legislation, citing cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.",
      "The new poll indicates that Republicans still have persuading to do. The high price tag may also be turning off some Americans. Trump's approval rating on government spending has fallen since the spring, according to the new survey, and about 6 in 10 U.S. adults across the political spectrum think the government is spending \u201ctoo much.\u201d",
      "Most people have heard at least something about the new law, according to the poll, which found that about two-thirds of U.S. adults have heard or read \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome\u201d about it.",
      "Those who know something about the legislation are more likely to believe it favors the wealthy, compared with people who have heard \u201conly a little\u201d or \u201cnothing at all.\"",
      "Anaiah Barrow, a 25-year-old single mom from North Carolina who doesn't identify with a political party, said she\u2019s concerned that the new law will hurt caregivers like her. Barrow -- who\u2019s juggling a job, taking care of two young children and pursuing a degree -- is concerned about losing access to day care and food stamps.",
      "\u201cIt has a really big effect,\u201d Barrow said of the recently passed legislation, which she has learned about on TikTok. \u201cIt may not be as a big now, but in the long run it\u2019s going to have that effect -- it\u2019s going to hit bad.\u201d",
      "Even many Republicans agree that the wealthy are likely to benefit from the tax and spending law. About half say the law will do more to help the wealthy. A similar percentage say this about middle-class people, while about 4 in 10 Republicans think it will do more to help than hurt low-income people.",
      "Lori Nichols, a 51-year-old caregiver for her elderly mother in Illinois, said the legislation has \u201cvery little for the older people and people that are on disability.\u201d Although Nichols is a Republican, she said she didn't vote in the 2024 presidential election and voted for Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "\u201cAs far as the tax part goes, it seems to me like (Trump\u2019s) just making the rich richer,\u201d Nichols said.",
      "Despite the overall sense that wealthy people will be the primary beneficiaries, Democrats and independents are much likelier than Republicans to think the law could harm them personally.",
      "Nathan Hay, a shift service manager at an international dealership that repairs trucks, said he thinks lower-income people might see a \u201cslight increase\u201d in taxes but still supports the bill. \u201cPersonally, it\u2019s not helping me a ton,\u201d Hay said, but he believes it will help small businesses, which have been a staple in his own life and his family\u2019s.",
      "About half of Republicans expect the legislation to do more to help \u201cpeople like you,\u201d compared with about 2 in 10 independents and just 6% of Democrats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a tax accountant, but it sounds as if it would be more beneficial to (people) in the higher tax level,\u201d said Republican Geraldine Putnam, 87, a Trump voter who lives in the rural south.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I would want to take away the incentive to become more wealthy \u2014 that\u2019s the American dream,\u201d Putnam said.",
      "But she also thinks she'll end up paying more in taxes. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing I'm sure he thinks is correct,\" she said of Trump. \"It\u2019s just the extreme method that he\u2019s using.\u201d",
      "The law's hefty price tag may be factoring into some Americans' assessments of the law. The poll found they are less likely to approve of how Trump is handling government spending since the spring.",
      "Just 38% of Americans approve of how Donald Trump is handling government spending, compared with 46% in an AP-NORC poll conducted in March.",
      "Republicans are less likely to say the government is spending \u201ctoo much\u201d than they were in March 2023, when Joe Biden was president, but about 6 in 10 still think the government is overspending. A similar share of Democrats say the same thing.",
      "Putnam, now a retiree, took issue with Trump\u2019s cuts in federal workers, even though she says she approves of being able to \u201ctrim off people who aren\u2019t really doing their jobs.\u201d",
      "The way she sees it, Trump drew attention to people abusing social services, then \u201cfires the people in the office\u201d that are investigating that very fraud and abuse. \u201cWhat\u2019s the sense in that?\u201d she asked.",

      "The European Union is targeting Russia with more sanctions over its war on Ukraine",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union approved on Friday a new raft of sanctions against Russia over its war on Ukraine, including a lower oil price cap, a ban on transactions with Nord Stream gas pipelines, and the targeting of more shadow fleet ships, the EU foreign policy chief said.",
      "\u201cThe message is clear: Europe will not back down in its support for Ukraine. The EU will keep raising the pressure until Russia ends its war,\u201d Kaja Kallas said in a statement.",
      "Kallas said the measures amount to \u201cone of its strongest sanctions packages against Russia to date\u201d linked to the war, now in its fourth year. It comes as European countries start to buy U.S. weapons for Ukraine to help the country better defend itself.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the new measures, describing them as a \u201ctimely and necessary\u201d step amid intensified Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cAll infrastructure of Russia\u2019s war must be blocked,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukraine will synchronize its sanctions with the EU and introduce its own additional measures soon.",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, had proposed to lower the oil price cap from $60 to $45, which is lower than the market price to target Russia\u2019s vast energy revenues. The 27 member countries decided to set the price per barrel at just under $48.",
      "The EU had hoped to get major international powers in the Group of Seven countries involved in the price cap to broaden the impact, but conflict in the Middle East pushed up oil prices and the Trump administration could not be brought onboard.",
      "In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s Western allies limited sales of Russian oil to $60 per barrel but the price cap was largely symbolic as most of Moscow\u2019s crude \u2014 its main moneymaker \u2014 cost less than that. Still, the cap was there in case oil prices rose.",
      "Oil income is the linchpin of Russia\u2019s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.",
      "A new import ban was also imposed in an attempt to close a loophole allowing Russia to indirectly export crude oil via a number of non-EU countries.",
      "The EU also targeted the Nord Stream pipelines between Russia and Germany to prevent Putin from generating any revenue from them in future, notably by discouraging would-be investors. Russian energy giant Rosneft's refinery in India was hit as well.",
      "The pipelines were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany but are not in operation. They were targeted by sabotage in 2022, but the source of the underwater explosions has remained a major international mystery.",
      "On top of that, the new EU sanctions targeted Russia\u2019s banking sector, with the aim of limiting the Kremlin\u2019s ability to raise funds or carry out financial transactions. Two Chinese banks were added to the list.",
      "The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 24, 2022.",
      "More than 2,400 officials and \u201centities\u201d \u2014 often government agencies, banks, companies or organizations \u2014 have been hit with asset freezes and travel bans.",
      "But each round of sanctions is getting harder to agree, as measures targeting Russia bite the economies of the 27 member nations. Slovakia held up the latest package over concerns about proposals to stop Russian gas supplies, which it relies on.",
      "The last raft of EU sanctions, imposed on May 20, targeted almost 200 ships in Russia\u2019s sanction-busting shadow fleet of tankers. On Friday, 105 more ships were blocked from European ports, locks and from ship-to-ship transfers, bringing the total number of vessels now sanctioned to more than 400.",

Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries' long-term climate ambitions and energy security.",
      "Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam's Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan\u2019s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.",
      "U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they've gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.",
      "Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.",
      "Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska\u2019s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from",
      "The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.",
      "\u201cTrump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,\u201d said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so \u201cawash in the fuel\u201d that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia's growing economies.",
      "\u201cNot good for Southeast Asia's sustainability goals,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.",
      "Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.",
      "Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace\u2014making it harder to switch to renewables later. \u201cAnd you\u2019re more likely then to get stuck for longer,\u201d he said.",
      "Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.",
      "LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it\u2019s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.",
      "Many LNG contracts include \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don\u2019t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.",
      "Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.",
      "Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they're unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.",
      "South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year \u2014 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam \u2014 with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea\u2019s \u2014 would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.",
      "Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.",
      "Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.",
      "A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. \u201cThe U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,\u201d he said.",
      "LNG only contributes to energy security when it\u2019s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the bit that they leave out ... But it\u2019s pretty important,\u201d he said.",
      "This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.",
      "\u201cEvents in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,\u201d Kenner said.",
      "Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia\u2019s solar and wind potential is being used.",
      "\u201cThere are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,\u201d he said.",

On Thursday, TSMC\u2019s stock that trades in the United States rose 3.4%.",
      "Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.4% to 8,757.20, and the Kospi in South Korea shed 0.1% to 3,188.07. India's Sensex lost 0.6%.",
      "\u201cAsia\u2019s riding the global rally wave, AI fever refuses to break, and even the Fed is making soothing noises,\u201d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management wrote in a commentary. \u201cBut underneath all the sunshine is a market running hot, with volatility on sale and positioning still cautious.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.5% to top its all-time high set a week ago, closing at 6,297.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 44,484.49, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.7% to its own record set the day before, climbing to 20,885.65.",
      "Trading was calmer than on Wednesday, when President Donald Trump rocked financial markets by saying he had discussed the \u201cconcept\u201d of firing the chair of the Federal Reserve, though he said he was unlikely to do so. Such a move could help Wall Street get the lower interest rates investors love, but would also risk a weakened Fed unable to make the unpopular moves needed to keep inflation under control.",
      "Treasury yields were mixed following several better-than-expected reports on the economy.",
      "One said that shoppers upped their spending  at U.S. retailers by more last month than economists expected. Such spending, along with a relatively solid jobs market, has helped keep the U.S. economy out of a recession.",
      "A separate report said that fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits  last week, which could be a signal of limited layoffs. A third suggested unexpectedly strong growth in manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region.",
      "Such solid data could keep the Federal Reserve on pause when it comes to interest rates. The Fed has been keeping rates steady this year, after cutting them at the end of last year. The Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, has been insisting that he wants to wait for more data about how Trump\u2019s tariffs will affect the economy and inflation before the Fed makes its next move.",
      "That\u2019s because while lower interest rates could boost the economy and prices for investments, they would also give inflation more fuel. Prices may already be starting to feel the upward effects of tariffs, based on the latest data. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 84 cents to $67.07 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 80 cents to $70.32 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 148.72 Japanese yen from 148.61 yen. The euro rose to $1.1640 from $1.1596.",

      "President Donald Trump is granting two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other industries as he seeks to reverse Biden-era regulations he considers overly burdensome",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is granting two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other polluting industries as he seeks to reverse Biden-era regulations he considers overly burdensome.",
      "Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security.",
      "The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.",
      "The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden's administration, the White House said.",
      "Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that \u201ccritical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs,'' the White House said in a fact sheet.",
      "Trump\u2019s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.",
      "Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a \u201cpolluters\u2019 portal\u201d that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother\u2019s womb.",
      "Within weeks of the EPA's offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements.",
      "The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security.",
      "John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump\u2019s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were \u201cpretexts\u201d so he could help big corporations get richer.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,\u2033 Walke said. \u201cIf your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.\u201d",
      "In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency\u2019s website lists 47 power providers \u2014 which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants \u2014 that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history.\"",
      "An Associated Press examination of the proposed rollbacks concluded that rules targeted by the EPA could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect. The AP review included the agency\u2019s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.",
      "In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help ... unleash American energy,\" Zeldin said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A top Federal Reserve official said late Thursday that the central bank should cut its key interest rate later this month, carving out a different view than that of Chair Jerome Powell, who has been harshly criticized by the White House for delaying rate cuts.",
      "Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, said in a speech in New York City that the economy is showing signs of weakening, with consumer spending slowing and job gains cooling. The Fed should reduce borrowing costs to shore up spending and growth before the job market weakens further, Waller said.",
      "\u201cThe economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly,\u201d he said, adding that the slowdown threatens the Fed\u2019s goal of maximum employment.",
      "At the same time, President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are likely to only lift inflation temporarily and aren't a reason to postpone rate cuts, Waller said.",
      "\u201cTariffs have boosted, and will continue to boost, inflation a bit above the (Fed's) 2% objective this year,\u201d Waller said, but policymakers should \u201clook through tariff effects and focus on underlying inflation,\u201d which he said is nearing the 2% goal.",
      "Waller has been mentioned as a potential replacement for Powell when the current chair\u2019s term expires in May 2026, or perhaps earlier if Trump takes the unprecedented step of firing Powell. Trump has threatened to fire Powell this year but on Wednesday said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d he would take such a step.",
      "For his part, Powell has said the Fed wants to see the impact of the duties on prices and the economy before making any moves.",
      "Waller, a Trump appointee, has previously said that he would support a rate cut in July. Michelle Bowman, also a Trump appointee, has also spoken in favor of a cut.",
      "Minutes to the Fed's June 17-18 meeting said that only \u201ca couple\u201d of the 19 members of the central bank's interest-rate setting committee supported a cut in July.",
      "Other participants \u2014 the minutes didn't say how many \u2014 said that the Fed should keep rates unchanged this year, since inflation remains above 2%. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year ago, the fastest pace in four months.",
      "Other potential replacements for Powell have also publicly expressed support for cutting rates soon, including Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Fed's board who stepped down in 2011. Warsh, currently a fellow at the Hoover Institution, said on Fox News' \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d earlier this week that he supported rate cuts.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s right to be frustrated with Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve,\u201d Warsh said.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has hinted at possible changes to TSA's liquid restrictions",
      "NEW YORK -- When limits on liquids were introduced at TSA checkpoints across the country in 2006, bins overflowed with bottled water, toothpaste, shaving cream and so much more. Nearly two decades later, travelers are much more accustomed to the \u201c3-1-1\u201d regulations\" governing the size of the liquids they're flying with, but scenes of passengers guzzling a beverage before putting their bags through the screening machines are still common.",
      "That's why Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent ripples through the traveling public when she said earlier this week that changes might be afoot when it comes to the TSA's current liquid limits.",
      "\u201cThe liquids, I\u2019m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,\u201d Noem told a conference in Washington.",
      "Will travelers be able to carry bigger bottles? Multiple 1-quart bags of liquids? Those details haven't been rolled out. But coming on top of her announcement earlier this month that travelers could keep their shoes on at TSA checkpoints, it seems a much different security experience for American air travelers might be emerging.",
      "Airline travel changed dramatically after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Before that, airlines were responsible for security and would often contract it out to private firms, said Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group. Travelers often didn't need to show their ID at security checkpoints \u2014 and people without boarding passes, such as family members or friends, could go to the gate in some locations.",
      "\u201cIt was much more casual. And clearly it was ineffective, because 9/11 occurred,\u201d Hartevelt said.",
      "That's when the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration were born, with the mandate of preventing more terrorist attacks.",
      "The liquid limits, however, didn\u2019t kick in until 2006, after authorities foiled a plot that used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage. The TSA then very briefly banned all liquids in carry-on luggage. That ban lasted about six weeks, but strained airlines\u2019 baggage systems as more and more travelers turned to checked bags to pack toiletries.",
      "At the time the 3.4-ounce limit was implemented, the FBI and other laboratories had found that tiny amounts of substances small enough to fit into a quart-size bag couldn\u2019t blow up an airliner.",
      "When the ban was eventually lifted in September 2006, consumers and businesses alike had to learn how to adapt to the 3-1-1 rule \u2014 leading to more demand for smaller, travel size bottles of anything from shampoo to toothpaste, as well as clear, \u201cTSA approved\u201d toiletry bags that are still seen on store shelves today.",
      "The rule was also adopted in many countries around the world starting later that year.",
      "Keith Jeffries, a former TSA director at Los Angeles International Airport and now vice president of K2 Security Screening Group, says whatever comes next needs to be clear for passengers. And he knows whereof he speaks.",
      "Jeffries was working for TSA in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when the liquids rules came down overnight. Signage had to be changed to let passengers know of the new regulations. Barrels overflowing with toothpaste, shaving cream and shampoo had to be emptied every half hour. Jeffries remembers seeing a pair of shoes sitting in one of the barrels.",
      "When he asked why, a TSA staffer said there was gel in the soles. \u201cI said, 'Please tell me I don\u2019t have a passenger back there walking in the sterile area barefoot. And he says, 'No, sir, they still have their socks on,'\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how chaotic it was.\u201d",
      "Any move to simplify the screening process and cut down on the time it takes for passengers to navigate checkpoints would be a welcome change for everyone, Harteveldt says. Because it isn\u2019t just about convenience; those lines before the security checkpoints are the most at risk to a potential threat.",
      "The fact that the TSA felt confident enough to change its shoe policy earlier this month may not save too much time from an individual traveler\u2019s perspective, Harteveldt notes \u2014 but marks a \u201cbig step forward\u201d toward cutting down the average length of the security process when you think about the number of people going through U.S. airports each day. Relaxing current liquid restrictions could aid that effort.",
      "Still, questions remain. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is what the secretary is going to announce about liquids,\u201d Harteveldt said. \u201cWill they remove the liquid ban altogether \u2014 and can we go back to bringing full-sized of toiletries and other items with us? Will they allow people to bring more than one bag of toiletries and liquids? And importantly, will they relax the limit on (the) quart-size bag itself?\u2019\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also possible that the changes the TSA makes, whatever they are, only start at a handful of airports that have the technology to do so. Over the years, airports worldwide have adopted some aspects of security screenings faster or differently than others.",
      "But travelers could be confused if they\u2019re able to bring a full-size bottle of shampoo or lotion when flying out of one airport, for example, but not on their return trip home.",
      "\u201cThe devil is going to be in the details,\u201d Harteveldt said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the rollout plan will be absolutely critical.\u201d",
      "Harveldt says a more streamlined process could make travelers less stressed, but others \u2014 including flight attendants and pilots who are in the skies more frequently \u2014 may object and question whether airport security is being compromised. Still, Harveldt says he doesn\u2019t believe the TSA would make this change if the agency \u201cdidn\u2019t feel it was authentically, truly safe.\"",
      "If shoe regulations disappear and liquid restrictions are eased, the effects could ripple into the TSA PreCheck program, in which passengers submit information like their fingerprints and the agency prescreens them for any red flags. By giving the agency this information, the traveler then gets some benefits not available to other travelers \u2014 a special line to go through and the ability to keep their computers in their bags and their shoes on, for example.",
      "But if those benefits become more widely available to all passengers, will fewer people sign up for PreCheck?",
      "\u201cWhat is the impact on now both shoes and liquids going to have on TSA PreCheck enrollment? That is the million-dollar question,\" Jeffries said. \u201cAnd if I was still with TSA, I would be watching that closely over the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d",
      "While the prospect of increasing the current liquid limit could be a welcome change for many U.S. travelers, some experts say that the tech isn\u2019t available in enough airports yet. Current X-ray machines used at most airports today have a difficult time distinguishing between different types of liquids, says Jeffrey Price, a professor of aviation at Metropolitan State University of Denver.",
      "That\u2019s key, he explains, in determining whether something is harmless or potentially explosive.",
      "While newer computed tomography scanners are better and have begun making their way to airports, Price said in commentary published last week that it could take \u201canother decade or more\u201d before the newer machines are deployed at all U.S. airports.",
      "\u201cThis is an issue that needs to be studied much more carefully than the policy to leave your shoes on,\u201d he said in an email Thursday.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the agency's renovation of two of its buildings is in compliance with plans approved by a local commission, disputing a White House suggestion that they may have violated the law by deviating from those plans.",
      "The letter is the lastest salvo in an escalating battle between the Federal Reserve, an independent agency charged with fighting inflation and seeking maximum employment, and the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has for months criticized Powell and the Fed for not lowering its key interest rate, which the president says would boost borrowing and accelerate the economy.",
      "Powell has said he wants to see how the economy responds to Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, which could raise inflation and slow growth, before making any moves.",
      "Trump has even threatened to fire Powell, though he has since backed away and said Wednesday it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that he would take the unprecedented step of doing so. Firing the Fed chair could cause chaos in the financial markets. Several executives of Wall Street banks have said this week that the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics is crucial.",
      "Still, the Trump administration has seized on ballooning costs for the Fed's renovation of two century-old buildings to argue that Powell has mismanaged the project. The president can't fire the Fed chair because of a policy disagreement, but he could do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is widely seen as some kind of malfeasance or neglect.",
      "Last week, the president's top budget adviser, Russell Vought, wrote Powell a letter that said Trump is \u201cextremely troubled\u201d by Powell's management of the project, which has risen in cost to about $2.5 billion, up from the Fed's initial estimate of $1.9 billion.",
      "Vought's letter also noted that Powell, in testimony before the Senate last month, said that the Fed removed some amenities that critics called ostentatious from its plans. Those plans had been approved by the National Capital Planning Commission in 2021.",
      "Vought said in his letter that if the renovation plans had changed, they were no longer \u201cin compliance with the approved plan\" and may violate the National Capital Planning Act.",
      "Powell responded Thursday that since the Fed\u2019s plans were approved by the NCPC in September 2021, it has made only \u201ca small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements\u201d and added that the changes weren\u2019t significant enough to \u201cwarrant... further review.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe project is proceeding in accordance with the plan that the NCPC approved,\u201d Powell wrote.",
      "The changes were intended \u201cto simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases,\u201d Powell said in his letter.",
      "Powell also defended the cost of the renovation: \u201cBoth buildings were in need of significant structural repairs,\u201d including \u201cthe removal of asbestos and lead contamination,\u201d as well as the \u201ccomplete replacement of antiquated systems such as electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, as well as fire detection and suppression systems,\u201d he wrote.",

      "Netflix on Thursday announced another quarter of steady growth built upon its video streaming service\u2019s more than 300 million subscribers",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Netflix on Thursday announced another quarter of steady growth as the video streaming service's more than 300 million subscribers have become increasingly attractive to advertisers.",
      "It\u2019s a familiar script that Netflix has followed for the past three years to widen its lead in video streaming while delivering financial results that have usually easily exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors.",
      "While Netflix's profit eclipsed Wall Street\u2019s expectations by a wide margin in the April-June quarter, its revenue came in right around the bar set by analysts. The Los Gatos, California, company earned $3.1 billion, or $7.19 per share, a 46% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 16% to $11.08 billion. Management also slightly raised its revenue forecast for the entire year, citing a belief that its programming lineup will reel in more subscribers in the second half than the first.",
      "Netflix\u2019s shares slipped 1% in extended trading, indicating investors expected an even more robust performance. But that is a minor stumble, given Netflix's stock price has soared 43% this year. The stock's strong run began during the second half of 2022 when the company introduced a low-priced version of its service with commercial interruptions as an antidote to an abrupt downturn in subscribers.",
      "The video streaming service is also faring well in Hollywood, as evidenced by the 120 Emmy nominations showered upon its programs earlier this week \u2013 second only to Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s HBO Max. In the past quarter, Netflix hailed \u201cSirens,\u201d \u201cGinny & Georgia\u201d and \u201cThe Four Seasons\u201d as being among its most watched programming.",
      "The popularity of Netflix\u2019s scripted programming combined with weekly World Wrestling Entertainment spectacles, high-profile boxing matches and periodic National Football League games have enabled its service to retain subscribers while its prices rise, including on the cheapest tier.",
      "Netflix stopped providing quarterly updates on its total subscribers at the beginning of this year, but the company\u2019s revenue growth leaves no doubt that the number has grown from the 302 million reported at the end of 2024.",
      "It\u2019s gradually turning into an advertising magnet, too.",
      "Although Netflix still isn\u2019t selling enough commercials to require a disclosure of its advertising revenue, management continues to highlight the growth in its results. Netflix said its ad revenue for this year is on pace to double from last year.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage rose for the second week in a row, another setback for the U.S. housing market, which is mired in a sales slump as affordability constraints shut out prospective homebuyers.",
      "The long-term rate ticked up to 6.75% from 6.72% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.77%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also rose. The average rate increased to 5.92% from 5.86% last week. A year ago, it was 6.05%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "When mortgage rates rise they can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They\u2019ve remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have continued to climb, albeit more slowly.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "The main barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.45% at midday Thursday, down from 4.46% late Wednesday.",
      "Yields have largely moved higher this month as traders bet that a better-than-expected June jobs report could keep the Fed on hold when it comes to interest rates.",
      "Bond investors briefly drove longer-term yields higher Wednesday, after President Donald Trump said he had discussed the \u201cconcept\u201d of firing the chair of the Federal Reserve but was unlikely to do so.",
      "The president has been calling for Powell to cut interest rates. A less independent Fed could mean lower short-term rates, but it could have the opposite effect on the longer-term bond yields that influence the rates on home loans.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "The rise in mortgage rates appears to have discouraged some home shoppers. Mortgage applications fell 10% last week from a week earlier as higher rates and economic uncertainty dampened demand, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Economists generally expect mortgage rates to stay relatively stable in the coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain in a range between 6% and 7% this year.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in three months, a sign that the U.S. labor market remains sturdy despite fears over the impact of widespread U.S. tariffs.",
      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that jobless claims for the week ending July 12 fell by 7,000 to 221,000, the fifth straight weekly decline and the fewest since mid-April. Last week\u2019s number was also lower than the 232,000 that analysts forecast. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as representative of layoffs.",
      "Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added a surprising 147,000 jobs in June, adding to evidence that the American labor market continues to show resilience despite uncertainty over President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies. The job gains were much bigger than expected and the unemployment rate ticked down 4.1% from 4.2% in May. Analysts were expecting the unemployment to rise to 4.3%.",
      "Though the job market is broadly healthy by historical standards, some weakness has surfaced as employers contend with fallout from Trump\u2019s policies, especially his aggressive tariffs, which raise prices for businesses and consumers. Most economists believe the import duties make the economy less efficient by reducing competition. They also invite retaliatory tariffs from other countries, hurting U.S. exporters and potentially driving businesses to freeze hiring or cut staff.",
      "The deadline on most of Trump\u2019s stiff proposed taxes on imports were extended again until Aug. 1. Unless Trump reaches deals with other countries to lower the tariffs, economists fear they could act as a drag on the economy and trigger another bout of inflation.",
      "Companies that have announced job cuts this year include Procter & Gamble, Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft, Google and Facebook parent company Meta.",
      "The Labor Department\u2019s report Thursday said that the four-week average of claims, which smooths out some of the weekly ups and downs, fell by 6,250 to 229,500.",
      "The total number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits for the week of July 5 remained stable, ticking up by just 2,000 to 1.96 million.",

      "Retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in June after declining 0.9% in May, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Sales in April fell 0.1%, pulled down by a steep drop in auto sales, after Americans ramped up their car-buying in March to get ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts.",
      "Excluding autos and automotive parts, sales rose 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "There was broad-based strength across the board. Clothing and accessories sales rose 0.9%, while health and personal care sales saw a 0.5% bump. Restaurants sales rose 0.6% , while online retailers recorded a 0.4% gain. Autos and automotive parts dealers rebounded with a 1.2% increase.",
      "There were a few weak spots like electronics and appliance retailers and department stores, both of which had sales declines.",
      "Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that layoffs remain low and consumers are still confident enough that the economy is chugging along.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t count the American consumer out yet,\" said Long in a statement. \"There\u2019s still a lot of trepidation about tariffs and likely price hikes, but consumers are willing to buy if they feel they can get a good deal. The word of the summer for the economy is resilient.\u201d",
      "The retail sales report arrives amid a whipsaw frenzy of on and off again tariffs have that jolted businesses and households. For businesses, that has made it harder to manage supply and inventories. Americans are focusing more on necessities, when they do shop.",
      "The latest government report showed that inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs push up the costs of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances.",
      "Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May. On a monthly basis, prices climbed 0.3% from May to June, after rising just 0.1% the previous month.",
      "Trump insists that the U.S. effectively has no inflation as he has attempted to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into reducing short-term interest rates.",
      "Yet the new inflation numbers make it more likely that the central bank will leave rates where they are. Powell has said that he wants to measure the economic impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs before reducing borrowing costs.",
      "Americans have continued to spend, which is what the Fed had hoped to curtail a little bit with rate hikes.",
      "One big litmus test was Amazon\u2019s four-day Prime event along with competing retail sales from the likes of Walmart and Target that kicked off last week. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks online sales, reported that the sales events drove $24.1 billion in online spending, a 30.3% increase compared with the same period last year.",
      "Still, those that were buying prioritized essentials like dish soap and paper products over big-ticket purchases, according to consumer data provider Numerator, based on its analysis of Amazon Prime orders.",
      "Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, said she\u2019s becoming more optimistic about the financial health of the consumer after the Amazon Prime events. She said inventories are at a healthy level, and she didn\u2019t see big fire sales.",
      "\u201dPeople aren\u2019t buying things that they don\u2019t need,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a healthier retail environment.\u201d",
      "Retailers are now turning their attention to the back-to-school shopping season, which is the second largest consumer rush after the winter holidays. Coresight Research estimates that total U.S. back-to-school spending will increase by 3.3% year compared with the year-ago period, to $33.3 billion. And it predicts that shoppers will do a big chunk of their shopping before August to get ahead of tariffs.",
      "Economists will also dissect quarterly financial reports next month from major retailers like Walmart, Target and Macy\u2019s, both for consumer behavior and to gauge how businesses are navigating a chaotic period of global trade due to fluid U.S. policies.",
      "Levi Strauss & Co. said last week that it was cutting back on making styles that aren\u2019t selling and making targeted price increases as it moves production away from China due to tariffs.",

      "WOODINVILLE, Wash. -- More than 1 million low-income households \u2014 most of them working families with children \u2014 who depend on the nation\u2019s public housing and Section 8 voucher programs could be at risk of losing their government-subsidized homes under the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to impose a two-year time limit on rental assistance.",
      "That\u2019s according to new research from New York University, obtained exclusively by The Associated Press, which suggests the time restriction could affect as many as 1.4 million households helped by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "The NYU report also raises concerns about the largely untested policy, as most of the limited number of local housing authorities that have voluntarily tried the idea eventually abandoned the pilots.",
      "\u201cIf currently assisted households are subject to a two-year limit, that would lead to enormous disruption and large administrative costs,\" for public housing authorities, the report said, adding that once the limit was up, housing authorities \"would have to evict all of these households and identify new households to replace them.\u201d",
      "Amid a worsening national affordable housing and homelessness crisis, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is determined to reshape HUD\u2019s expansive role providing stable housing for low-income people, which has been at the heart of its mission for generations.",
      "At a June congressional budget hearing, HUD Secretary Scott Turner argued reforms like time limits will fix waste and fraud in public housing and Section 8 voucher programs while motivating low-income families to work toward self-sufficiency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s broken and deviated from its original purpose, which is to temporarily help Americans in need,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHUD assistance is not supposed to be permanent.\u201d",
      "Elderly and disabled people would be exempted, but there\u2019s little guidance from the agency on how time-limited housing assistance would be implemented \u2014 how it would be enforced, when the clock starts and how the exemptions would be defined.",
      "The NYU researchers dove deep into HUD\u2019s nationwide data over a 10-year period, analyzing nearly 4.9 million households that have been public housing and Section 8 voucher tenants. Of that, about 2.1 million could be affected by the time limits because they include at least one adult who is not elderly or disabled and about 70% of those households had already been living on those subsidies for two or more years.",
      "HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett pushed back on the NYU study.",
      "\u201cThere is plenty of data that strongly supports time limits and shows that long-term government assistance without any incentive disincentivizes able-bodied Americans to work,\u201d Lovett said in a statement.",
      "The time limits could displace more than a million children, as it would largely punish families who are working but still earning far below their area\u2019s median income.",
      "\u201cHousing assistance is especially impactful for children,\u201d said Claudia Aiken, the director of new research partnerships for the Housing Solutions Lab at NYU's Furman Center who co-authored the study with Ellie Lochhead. Their health, education, employment and earnings potential can \u201cchange in really meaningful ways if they have stable housing,\u201d Aiken said.",
      "Havalah Hopkins, a 33-year-old single mom, has been living in a public housing unit outside of Seattle since 2022, but now fears a two-year time limit would leave her and her teenage son homeless. The 14-year-old boy has autism but is considered high-functioning, so how HUD defines disabled and \u201cable-bodied\u201d for the time limit could determine if their family will be affected by the restriction.",
      "Hopkins, who does catering work for a local chain restaurant, pays $450 a month in rent \u2014 30% of her household income \u2014 for their two-bedroom apartment in Woodinville, Washington.",
      "Asked what she likes most about her home, Hopkins said: \u201cI like that I can afford it.\u201d",
      "Of the 17 housing authorities that tried time limits, 11 discontinued the trial. None tried two-year limits \u2014 the most common policy was a five-year limit with the option for an extra two and the limits usually applied to specific programs or referrals.",
      "Although there are over 3,000 housing authorities in the country, only 139 of them have ever been granted flexibility to consider testing a time limit while using federal funds for programs such as job training and financial counseling.",
      "\u201cAny conversation about time limits ends up being this really nuanced, hyper-local focus on what works for specific communities rather than this broad national-level implementation,\u201d said Jim Crawford, director of the Moving to Work Collaborative which oversees that group of housing authorities.",
      "Even with those supports, several housing authorities said rent was still too high and well-paying jobs were scarce, according to the study. Others said they didn\u2019t have enough capacity to provide enough supportive services to help households afford rent.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are set to sign a treaty on Thursday pledging to tighten defense ties and step up law-enforcement cooperation against gangs that smuggle migrants across the English Channel.",
      "The center-right German leader is in London on his first official visit to Britain since taking office in May. Starmer visited Berlin in August 2024, announcing plans for the U.K.-Germany \u201cfriendship and cooperation\u201d treaty with Merz\u2019s predecessor, Olaf Scholz.",
      "A priority for Starmer, who heads the center-left Labour Party, is curbing the gangs behind cross-channel people smuggling. About 37,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel from France in small boats in 2024, and more than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of 2025. Dozens of people have died trying to cross.",
      "Berlin agreed last year to make facilitating the smuggling of migrants to the U.K. a criminal offence, a move that will give law enforcements more powers to investigate the supply and storage of small boats to be used for the crossings. Merz is expected to commit to adopting the law change by the end of the year.",
      "\u201cChancellor Merz\u2019s commitment to make necessary changes to German law to disrupt the supply lines of the dangerous vessels which carry illegal migrants across the Channel is hugely welcome,\u201d Starmer said, calling the U.K. and Germany \u201cthe closest of allies.\u201d",
      "Germany and the U.K. \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest and second-largest economies \u2013 are also expected to announce a series of investment deals.",
      "The treaty builds on a defense pact the U.K. and Germany, two of the biggest European supporters of Ukraine, signed last year pledging closer co-operation against a growing threat from Russia. It includes a promise to come to one another\u2019s aid in case of attack.",
      "The two leaders also are expected to agree Thursday to joint export campaigns for jointly produced equipment such as Boxer armored vehicles and Typhoon jets, and to develop a deep precision strike missile in the next decade.",
      "Starmer has worked to improve relations with Britain\u2019s neighbors, strained by the U.K.\u2019s acrimonious departure from the European Union in 2020. He has sought to rebuild ties strained by years of ill-tempered wrangling over Brexit terms. He has ruled out rejoining the 27-nation bloc\u2019s single market or customs union, and has been cool to the idea of a youth mobility agreement with the EU, but has sought to reduce trade barriers and to strengthen defense cooperation.",
      "\u201cI make no secret of the fact I very much regret to this day that Britain left the European Union,\u201d Merz told the German parliament last week. \u201cBut if they at least work together with us again in the area of foreign and security policy, then that is a very good sign. Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants that.\u201d",

      "All of the proposed casinos, in application materials submitted in recent days, promise to create thousands of new jobs, flashy new community amenities in the form of hotels, shops, restaurants and entertainment venues and billions of dollars a year in taxable gambling revenues for the state\u2019s coffers.",
      "How realistic those promises are, though, is an open question, given the proliferation of casinos in the northeast and the explosion of online gambling in recent years, casino experts say.",

Spokespersons for Bally\u2019s declined to comment on the future of the project this week.",
      "Not surprisingly, the debate over the proposed Times Square casino has taken center stage, with supporters and opponents recently holding dueling rallies in the Crossroads of the World.",
      "Among the prominent groups opposed to the $5.4 billion plan is the Broadway League, a trade group representing America\u2019s performing arts theaters. It says a casino would draw patrons away from neighborhood businesses and threaten a theater industry still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The project's backers have countered that the plan, which calls for renovating a skyscraper that currently houses the Minskoff Theatre, home of long-running \u201cThe Lion King\u201d musical, will actually boost demand for Broadway tickets.",
      "The developers, which have also enlisted Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation to curate their entertainment offerings, promise $250 million in community projects, including a public safety plan designed by former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and a multimillion-dollar civil rights museum that helped earn an endorsement from the Rev. Al Sharpton.",
      "The two other casinos proposed in Manhattan \u2014 one for its West Side and another on its East Side \u2014 could face similar headwinds, given their proximity to residential neighborhoods, according to casino experts.",
      "But the proposed West Side resort, near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the Lincoln Tunnel to New Jersey, could reel in business travelers and convention attendees, if it can win over locals, said Soojin Ha, a lecturer at Cornell University\u2019s business school.",
      "Meanwhile in Brooklyn, organizers of the quirky Mermaid Parade are among those leading the charge against a Coney Island casino, arguing the plan would remove large chunks of the boardwalk\u2019s iconic amusement rides and block access to the public beach.",
      "Since the 2013 referendum, four full casinos have opened in New York, though all of them are located upstate, miles away from Manhattan. The state also has nine gambling halls offering slot machines and other electronic gambling machines but no live table games.",
      "Some three hours drive north of Manhattan are the Native American tribe-owned Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods casinos in Connecticut. Two hours south are the New Jersey shore casinos of Atlantic City, and less than two hours due west in Pennsylvania is the tribe-owned Wind Creek Casino at the former site of Bethlehem Steel.",
      "Despite the competition from seemingly all corners, New York City\u2019s dense market could sustain three gambling halls, depending on where they\u2019re located, suggests John Holden, a business professor at Indiana University who specializes in gambling law.",
      "\u201cWe typically see fairly rosy revenue projections put out by the gaming industry, but the New York City market is really without comparison,\u201d he said.",
      "The state could hedge its bets by awarding two of the three licenses to proven winners: the racinos -- slot parlors built alongside horse racing tracks \u2014 that have been successfully operating for years in the New York City area, said Alan Woinski, a New Jersey-based gambling consultant.",
      "MGM Resorts is proposing a $2.3 billion expansion of the Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway. Resorts World, owned by Malaysian casino giant Genting, is proposing a $5.5 billion investment to its gaming facility at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens.",
      "Those expansions, Woinski noted, could be rolled out in a matter of months, meaning the state wouldn\u2019t have to wait years for the construction of a wholly new site to start reaping the financial windfall.",

      "TOKYO -- Canadian retail chain Alimentation Couche-Tard is dropping its proposal to acquire Seven & i Holdings Co., the Japanese operator of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, citing frustration in ongoing negotiations that showed \u201ca lack of constructive engagement.\u201d",
      "The 7-Eleven parent company rejected an offer last year, but Couche-Tard, which runs the global Circle K chain, was still interested and tried to coax a deal with the Japanese chain known here as \u201cconbini.\u201d",
      "In a letter dated July 16 and sent to the Seven & i board, Couche-Tard stressed it had made a good offer earlier this year in a proposal of 2,600 yen ($17.50) per ordinary share in cash, which it said represented a 47.6% premium to the stock price. The initial offer, made last year, was for 2,200 yen ($14.86) per share in cash.",
      "In the letter, sent to media Thursday and signed by its two top executives, including founder Alain Bouchard, Couche-Tard expressed exasperation at the response it was getting from Seven & i despite repeated attempts at dialogue.",
      "\u201cWe have been very patient and respectful throughout this process, beginning with our meeting on July 23, 2024,\u201d the letter said.",
      "\u201cYou have engaged in a calculated campaign of obfuscation and delay, to the great detriment of 7 & i and its shareholders. We believe this approach reinforces our concerns about your approach to governance. Based on this persistent lack of good faith engagement, we are withdrawing our proposal.\u201d",
      "Couche-Tard, which runs nearly 17,000 stores in more than 30 countries and territories, including the U.S., said the documents it got lacked key information, executives were no-shows at meetings, and the meetings it did have ended up being \u201creadouts\u201d of statements, not frank discussions.",
      "Seven & i acknowledged the dropped offer Thursday and said it considered talks \u201cin good faith and constructively.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain fully committed to our standalone value creation plan, which we have been pursing in parallel, and to unlocking the value of our businesses, including our North American convenience store business. Our plan is concrete and actionable,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "Some analysts say Seven & i management has not fully leveraged the business\u2019 global potential or delivered enough value to shareholders, and could use better marketing, although its bottom line is unlikely to be affected by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies.",
      "The 7-Eleven franchise, which spans more than 85,000 stores in Japan, the U.S. and Europe, has a new chief executive, Stephen Hayes Dacus, the first foreigner tapped to head 7-Eleven. Dacus, an American whose mother is Japanese, has promised a leaner business by focusing on the supply chain and tailoring shop offerings to various regions.",
      "For the first quarter of this fiscal year, Seven & i reported a doubling in profits to 49 billion yen ($330 million), mainly due to previously announced sales of property and equipment at its Ito-Yokado Co. retail chain.",
      "Quarterly sales held up, as a favorable exchange rate helped some overseas earnings, according to the Tokyo-based chain. The seemingly omnipresent 7-Eleven chain speckles the streets of Japan, offering everything from stationery items and rice balls to hot coffee and utility bill payments.",

      "The nation\u2019s largest public utility says it is looking at other sites for a new natural gas power plant after its preferred location in Tennessee drew heavy public scrutiny, including from country musician John Rich",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 The nation's largest public utility says it is looking at other sites for a new natural gas power plant after its preferred location in Tennessee drew heavy public scrutiny, including from country musician John Rich.",
      "The Tennessee Valley Authority announced Tuesday that the Cheatham County site is no longer its preferred one.",
      "Rich, a conservative supporter of President Donald Trump who has Cheatham County roots, has been a key opponent of TVA's 900-megawatt plant in the county. He said he enlisted Trump to team up on the issue. A TVA spokesperson declined to comment about Rich\u2019s comments, including whether Trump was involved. A White House spokesperson also declined to comment.",
      "The community has raised concerns about the potential impact on water quality, air quality, noise pollution, safety, property rights and more, in a rural area that also has homes and schools nearby. Clean energy and environmental groups have also led resistance to the proposal.",
      "Rich said Trump and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins \u201cjoined forces with me and all the residents of Cheatham County.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey pulled out under threat,\u201d Rich said about TVA in a social media post Tuesday. \"They pulled out because they\u2019re afraid President Trump is going to fire every member on that board.\u201d",
      "Based on feedback, the federal utility says it is considering a site at a nearby industrial park and other Middle Tennessee locations.",
      "Additionally, it floated options such as working with the Trump administration to extend the use of some fossil fuel plants. The utility has been planning to retire the last of its coal-fired plants by 2035. But Trump has signed executive orders aimed at boosting the coal industry.",
      "Power from the proposed Cheatham plant was intended to replace some of the electricity from the second unit of the coal-fired Cumberland Fossil Plant, which had been planned for retirement in 2028 but is now among the coal units being evaluated for potentially longer life.",
      "The site that sparked opposition includes the power plant and a battery storage system on 286 acres in Cheatham County, in addition to a 12-mile natural gas pipeline and up to 45 miles of transmission lines to the project. Rich last week posted a map showing many areas of farmland around the preferred area, saying it \u201cCANNOT happen.\u201d Rollins, the agriculture secretary, replied, \u201cON IT\u201d and \u201cStandby.\u201d",
      "Rich additionally has called for a \u201ccomplete revamping\u201d of TVA, saying, \u201cCheatham County ain't the only place they're doing this.\u201d",
      "Any final decision on the plant would need to await the installation of more TVA board members.",
      "Trump recently announced four nominees for the board, which for months has not had enough members to take many actions because Trump fired some of former President Joe Biden\u2019s picks. TVA provides power to more than 10 million people across seven southern states.",
      "The board normally has nine members and requires five to make a quorum. It currently has three. Trump\u2019s picks would not be seated until the U.S. Senate confirms them.",
      "Clean energy advocates applauded TVA\u2019s decision to back off the Cheatham County location, but said it should instead invest more in clean energy options and heed the concern of communities where similar gas plants are proposed in Cumberland City, Kingston and Memphis.",
      "\u201cInstead of simply shifting those harmful impacts to another area, TVA should scrap its plans for a new gas plant altogether and invest in clean and cost-effective power options, like solar power and battery storage,\u201d said Trey Bussey, a staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.",

      "Yu Zidi of China is only 12 years old and will race at the world swimming championships later this month in Singapore.",
      "That's amazing.",
      "But her age is only part of the picture.",
      "Not only is she very young, but her times in three events this year are among the best in the world. And here's the kicker. Those times would have been very close to medals in last year's Paris Olympics.",
      "Again, she's 12. That's a sixth- or seventh-grade student depending on the school system. Not yet a teenager.",
      "\u201cI think it's a great story. I don't know where it will lead,\u201d Greg Meehan, the national team director for the American squad in Singapore, told The Associated Press.",
      "As promising young swimmers do, Yu is clocking personal bests almost each time she competes. Her PBs are more than just confidence boosters, they put her in sight of records, medals and stardom.",
      "Yu has qualified in the 200- and 400-meter individual medleys, and the 200 butterfly. She could win a medal in all three.",
      "Her time of 2 minutes, 10.63 seconds in the 200 IM at the Chinese championships in May was the fastest ever by a 12-year-old swimmer \u2014 male or female \u2014 according to World Aquatics, the global governing body of the sport.",
      "That was only the start. Her time of 2:06.83 in the 200 butterfly in the same meet would have placed her fourth in last year's Paris Olympics. It was the fifth-fastest time in the world this year and would have been good enough for gold in the 2024 worlds.",
      "Again, Yu is 12 years old.",
      "To cap off the national championships she swam 4:35.53 in the 400 IM, the fifth-fastest time of the year in that event. That also would have been good for fourth place last year at the Olympics, just 0.6 behind bronze medalist Emma Weyant of the United States.",
      "The 400 IM is dominated by 18-year-old Canadian Summer McIntosh, who holds the world record of 4:23.65 and the 200 IM mark of 2:05.70. She's a generational talent, the winner of three gold medals in Paris.",
      "By comparison, Yu at 12 is swimming roughly 15 seconds faster in the 400 IM than McIntosh did at 12, and about 12 seconds faster in the 200 IM. In a 50-meter pool, 12 to 15 seconds would be a half-lap of the pool, depending on the event.",
      "Yu is not the first young swimmer to excel, but it's how she's doing it \u2014 the stunning times and the promise of more to come.",
      "Of course there are no guarantees of success, and young swimmers can burn out.",
      "Yu said she began swimming at 6 in a water amusement park.",
      "\u201cThe summer was too hot, and my dad took me to the water park,\" she told China's official Xinhua News Agency. \u201cI enjoyed the coolness of the water and spent a lot of time in different small pools for kids. One day, a coach approached me and asked if I wanted to swim faster.\"",
      "The rest is history, as they say, as she explained her event preference.",
      "\u201cSince I am not competitive in the sprint events, I have to choose the 400-meter individual medley and the 200-meter butterfly as my favorites,\u201d Yu told Xinhua. \"My age is currently an advantage and I hope to grow and develop more strength in the future.\u201d",
      "Yu trains at the Hebei Taihua Jinye Swimming Club in Hengshui City, south of Beijing in Hebei Province.",
      "Alzain Tareq of Bahrain swam in the 2015 worlds at only 10. She finished last in her event. World Aquatics now has stricter age rules than a decade ago. Swimmers must be at least 14 unless their times meet qualification standards. In effect, this means there is no age limit.",
      "If Yu were to win Olympic gold in three years in Los Angeles, she would be 15. But that wouldn't make her the youngest swimmer to take gold.",
      "Kyoko Iwasaki of Japan was 14 years and 6 days old when she won gold in the 200 breaststroke at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.",
      "Swimmers tend to peak early, particularly females.",
      "The specialty publication and website SwimSwam lists seven swimmers \u2014 all women \u2014 who won Olympic gold before they turned 15. Three, including Iwasaki, did it in individual events, and four got gold in relays.",
      "American superstar Katie Ledecky was 15 years and 139 days when she won the 800 freestyle at the 2012 London Olympics \u2014 the first of her nine gold medals over four Olympics.",
      "She's still swimming and is the overwhelming favorite to win the 1,500 meters in Singapore. Ledecky has the top 23 times in history in the event, and also No. 25.",
      "For another jolting perspective, consider this. Ledecky's first gold came several months before Yu was born \u2014 Oct. 6, 2012.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what it\u2019s like to compete abroad,\" Yu told Xinhua. \u201cI really want to experience the world-class competition.\u201d",

      "But Miles decided to return to college this year instead of going to the WNBA draft as a projected lottery pick. The former Notre Dame star transferred to TCU to try to improve her game, earn some extra NIL money and continue to grow her brand.",

      "Miles missed the 2023-24 season while recovering from an ACL tear she suffered in the regular-season finale the year before to end her sophmore campaign. She became the first men\u2019s or women\u2019s freshman to post a triple-double in the NCAA Tournament in 2022, and was putting the final touches on a season that had made her an Associated Press second-team All-American when she crashed to the baseline after her right knee buckled on a drive at Louisville in 2023.",
      "\u201cI just felt like I had a lot more left in me in the tank,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing far, far removed from my injury, mentally, physically, emotionally, was what I was telling myself, so, it was a lot of back and forth.\u201d",
      "Miles said she literally waited until the last minute to decide what she wanted to do, something she'd love to see the WNBA change in the future.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t decide until the very end, as you know, we have 48 hours to make a huge life decision, which is really hard,\u201d Miles said.",
      "One thing she\u2019s happy about when she does enter the WNBA next season is that there will be a new collective bargaining agreement that should include an increase in player salaries. Right now the rookie salary is about $75,000 for top picks. She\u2019ll make a lot more than that in college this year. The low salaries were one factor in Miles\u2019 decision, but she said it wasn\u2019t a major one.",
      "Then when she decided to stay in school, Miles made another big choice to enter the transfer portal and leave Notre Dame.",
      "\u201cI knew it was gonna be a big story. I knew it was gonna (upset) a lot of people,\" she said. \u201cI knew it was gonna cause a lot of commotion, but I ultimately was selfish one time with my career. I was talking to a bunch of power schools and then ultimately I really just wanted to go somewhere where I\u2019d be able to showcase my abilities the best that I can.\"",
      "Miles didn't get into specifics on why she decided to leave Notre Dame, but did say it was hard to tell Irish coach Niele Ivey that she was leaving.",
      "\u201cI was her first recruit so there was always a special kind of connection there, so when you have to have a hard conversation about people you care about, it's tough, but it had to be done,\u201d Miles said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want her to find out, apart from me, so I had to grow up in that moment we had the conversation and we kept it going.\u201d",

      "Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood are offering reminders that the British Open doesn't discriminate against older players",
      "PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- Phil Mickelson delivered more magic Thursday in the British Open, leaving one shot in a bunker and holing the next one from 75 feet away for an unlikely par. He tipped his cap. He gave a thumbs-up to the crowd.",
      "It looked like the Mickelson of old, especially with all that gray stubble in his beard.",
      "Mickelson, who opened with a 1-under 70 at Royal Portrush, already holds the major championship record for oldest winner, capturing the 2021 PGA Championship at Kiawah Island when he was 50.",
      "Now he's at the oldest championship in golf, the one that least discriminates against age. The Open is where 53-year-old Greg Norman had the lead going into the final round at Royal Birkdale in 2008, and more famously where 59-year-old Tom Watson was an 8-foot putt away from winning at Turnberry in 2009.",
      "\u201cThe Open gives the older gentlemen a chance to win more than any other tournament,\u201d 52-year-old Lee Westwood said after a day in which he was tied for the lead early in the round until a few bogeys dropped him back to a 69.",
      "Westwood is playing the British Open for the first time since he joined Saudi-funded LIV Golf in 2022, going through final regional qualifying three weeks ago to earn a spot in the field.",
      "He has yet to win in LIV Golf and his results would suggest he is riding out the rest of his career. And then he showed up at the major he first played in 1995 \u2014 Scottie Scheffler was not even born then \u2014 and found some form.",
      "Links golf helps.",
      "\u201cThere's not the premium on carrying traps. They don't make it unplayable for us older guys with length,\u201d Westwood said. \u201cYou can use your experience, guile and cunning on them.\u201d",
      "Westwood tripped over his words on the Sky Sports interview and then added, \u201cNot easy to say, but easy to use at our age.\u201d",
      "Mickelson, who has not won since that historic day at Kiawah Island, had missed the cut in all three majors this year. At age 55, he still has six more years playing the British Open as a champion at Muirfield in 2013.",
      "He started strong with a deft touch with his wedge to easy birdie range on the par-5 second, but the real Lefty showed up on the next hole when he put his tee shot into a bunker, plugged and not far from the steep lip.",
      "The first attempt barely got out, rolling on the edge of grass before tumbling back into the bunker. It looked like a bogey at best. But then he splashed out, carrying it some 25 yards and about 10 feet to the left, and the shot had enough side spin to drop into the cup.",
      "He raised both arms. Mickelson loves moments like these, and he's had plenty of them.",
      "\u201cThat was a crazy one,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cIt was really one of maybe two poor shots I hit, that bunker shot that buried in the lip. And then to make it was obviously a lot of luck. I was just trying to save bogey, and I got lucky it went in.\u201d",
      "And then his name stayed on the leaderboard the rest of the morning \u2014 a birdie on the par-5 seventh, a couple of bogeys on the back nine, a 20-foot birdie on the 17th hole.",
      "Mickelson had gone 21 consecutive rounds in a major without breaking par until Thursday in the British Open. Sure, he had the advantage of missing the rain for all but the last couple of holes. But it was good golf. It's still there.",
      "\u201cI played really well, and I had an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cI really enjoy playing these conditions and playing this tournament. It\u2019s just a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Not all of the 50-and-older gang had the best of times.",
      "Padraig Harrington, coming off his win in the U.S. Senior Open, had the honor and thrill of hitting the opening tee shot. He made birdie on the first hole. That was the highlight on his card when he signed for a 74.",
      "\u201cI got a little emotional when I was clapped on, and then I calmed down, and I was kind of fine when I was hitting it,\u201d Harrington said.",
      "He three-putted two straight holes and had a lost ball on No. 10. It was an otherwise forgettable day, except for the unforgettable start of hitting the first shot.",
      "\u201cYeah, it was a tough day on the greens, and it just ate into my game,\u201d he said. \u201cMight have been a little bit of the fact that I was hyped up for the first tee box. Who knows? Certainly felt like I played better, could have played better, should have played better.\u201d",

      "From being 3-under par after 10 holes, McIlroy was at even par as he faced a tough second shot at the 17th. He somehow hit it to 12 feet and holed the birdie putt.",
      "There were throaty roars from the grandstand around No. 18 as he walked to the green for a 45-foot birdie putt that slipped by the hole. He tapped in, raised his putter and thanked his fans. They'll be back in droves on Friday morning, no doubt.",

      "Especially on the first tee, which McIlroy walked onto in 2019 not quite realizing the emotions he'd soon feel playing an Open on Northern Irish turf for the first time. He handled it badly and the wind that swept in off the North Atlantic coast wound up blowing him out of the tournament.",

      "WNBA players and league officials met Thursday before the start of the All-Star weekend festivities for discussions on a new collective bargaining agreement",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Backed by what they said was their largest attendance ever for collective bargaining negotiations, WNBA players met with the league Thursday with the sides far apart in discussions for a new deal.",
      "All-Stars Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers and Angel Reese were among about 40 players, most wearing business suits, who took part in the first face-to-face meeting featuring players since December. The two sides met for a couple of hours.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m encouraged, you know, I'm just so inspired by the amount of players that showed up, the engagement that was there,\u201d WNBPA President Nneka Ogwumike said. \u201cThat\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. Because the more that happens, the more that we\u2019re going to be able to get things done. I think today we\u2019re going to be able to use this conversation to start rolling the ball on things.\u201d",
      "Players opted out of the current CBA last October and are seeking a better revenue sharing model, increased salaries, improved benefits, and a softer salary cap. All of those will help many of the younger players down the road like Reese.",
      "\u201cIt was something that was very informative for me. First time being able to see and hear, the wording, from both sides,\" Reese said. \"I was really eager to know and understand what was going on. So I\u2019m very aware of what\u2019s going on right now. We won\u2019t stop until we got what we want.\u201d",
      "The sides are far apart in preliminary discussions and agreed to another meeting.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to say progress, but we had spirited conversation,\u201d said Terri Carmichael Jackson, the executive director of the Women\u2019s National Basketball Players Association,.",
      "If a deal isn\u2019t done by the end of October, some players, including Napheesa Collier and Reese, have mentioned the potential of a walkout, which could present some immediate problems. The league has two new teams in Portland and Toronto starting next season and the expansion draft has typically been in December. Free agency usually starts in January.",
      "WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told The Associated Press after the meeting that both sides are in listening mode.",
      "\u201cIt was very constructive dialogue. I think, you know, obviously part of the process is to go back and forth and, listen to the players, they listen to us and the owners who represent the board of governors,\" Engelbert said. \"I still feel really optimistic that we can get something transformational done by the end. But it\u2019s a process.\u201d",
      "The league has never lost a game to a work stoppage since it started in 1997. Jackson said the sides would eventually get to a new deal, even if they may not have gotten any closer to it Thursday.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re on track to get back to meeting, and to engaging in conversations that will lead us to a CBA,\u201d she said.",
      "Jackson was particularly impressed by the number of young stars such as Clark who have helped spark unprecedented growth across nearly every business metric from attendance and viewership.",
      "There\u2019s also the new $2.2 billion media rights deal that will start next season and the league plans to expand to 18 teams by 2030, with each of the three new teams paying $250 million expansion fee.",
      "\u201cThis business is booming \u2013 media rights, ratings, revenue, team valuations, expansion fees, attendance, and ticket sales \u2013 are all up in historic fashion,\u201d the union statement said. \u201cBut short-changing the working women who make this business possible stalls growth. The only thing more unsustainable than the current system is pretending it can go on forever.\u201d",
      "Players sent the league an initial proposal in February that the league finally responded to last month. But both sides said they are still confident a deal can be reached",
      "\u201cI think we have plenty of time,\u201d Jackson said.",

      "He will get a chance to answer it Saturday night when the 46-year-old from the Philippines will try to take the WBC welterweight belt from Mario Barrios. It will be Pacquiao's first fight since losing by unanimous decision to Yordenis Ug\u00e1s nearly four years ago. His last victory occurred in 2019, a split decision over Keith Thurman.",
      "\u201cSaturday night, it\u2019s going to be a great fight,\" Pacquiao said. \"It\u2019s been a while that I\u2019ve been out of the ring, but I\u2019m still active and exercising all the time. I\u2019m going to prove to everyone that I\u2019m in great condition.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying training camp like I did in the past, just like when I was 26 years old. The discipline is still the same. Even with my layoff, my passion is still there.\"",
      "Barrios, a 30-year-old from San Antonio, is a -275 favorite at BetMGM Sportsbook to spoil Pacquiao's return. But he needs to bounce back from a split-decision draw on Nov. 15 against Abel Ramos that dropped his record to 29-2-1, 18 wins by knockout.",
      "\u201cManny is one of a kind,\" Barrios said. \"He\u2019s not an easy style to copy in training camp. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of different southpaw looks, so I\u2019m feeling extremely comfortable.",
      "\u201cIt feels amazing to be in this position. I poured everything into this sport since I was (a) kid, and now I get to walk the (Las Vegas) Strip with my family and see my name all over. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve always dreamed of. Now it\u2019s my job to show why I\u2019m going to continue to be the champion.\u201d",
      "The build-up to this bout hasn't come with the usual forced hatred that envelops many title fights. The combatants even chatted during the standard face-off pose at Wednesday's news conference and then broke into laughter.",
      "Hard to imagine that happening at a Gervonta Davis presser.",
      "Barrios cautioned not to read too much into the mutual respect and admiration when it comes to what the action in the ring might look like, that each boxer would bring his all.",
      "Pacquiao enters with a resume that includes 12 world championships in eight divisions as well as a 62-8-2 record with 39 KOs. He's considerably older and gives away about seven inches in height to the 6-foot Barrios.",
      "Pacman is back, but how back he truly is will be revealed Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been a challenger many times and it\u2019s always the same feeling,\u201d Pacquiao said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to take the belt. He\u2019s a good fighter also, but our job is to entertain the fans. We\u2019re going to give them a real fight.\u201d",
      "In the co-main event, WBC super welterweight champion Sebastian Fundora (21-1-1, 14 KOs) will face Tim Tszyu (25-2, 18 KOs). Fundora emerged with a split-decision victory over Tszyu on March 30, 2024.",
      "The WBO stripped Fundora of his belt for taking the rematch rather than face mandatory challenger Xander Zayas.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happened in the first fight because we have the second fight coming up,\" Fundora said. \"Tune in Saturday, because it\u2019s going to be another great war.\u201d",

      "That book title suggests the terms \u201csoccer\u201d and \u201cfootball\u201d were interchangeable in British culture at that time.",

      "\u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Bryan Braman,\u201d the team said. \u201cDuring his four seasons in Philadelphia, Bryan was a loyal teammate, a supporter of the community, and a valuable member of our Super Bowl LII-winning team. More importantly, he was a devoted father who passionately loved his family and everyone around him. We extend our deepest condolences to Bryan\u2019s family and all who are grieving his loss during this difficult time.\u201d",
      "Signed as an undrafted free agent by the Texans in 2011, Braman played seven seasons in the NFL. He spent his first three in Houston and last four in Philadelphia. The Eagles beat the Patriots 41-33 to win the franchise\u2019s first Super Bowl in Braman\u2019s final game on Feb. 4, 2018. He gave a fiery speech in the locker room before that game.",
      "Braman had 56 tackles, 1 1/2 sacks and two fumble recoveries in 97 career games.",

      "The Indiana Fever guard injured her right groin on Tuesday night in the final minute of the team\u2019s win over the Connecticut Sun. She said Thursday in a message posted on X that she had to rest her body.",
      "\u201cI am incredibly sad and disappointed to say I can\u2019t participate in the 3-Point Contest or the All-Star Game,\u201d Clark said in the message posted by the Fever. \u201cI have to rest my body. I will still be at Gainbridge Fieldhouse for all the action and I\u2019m looking forward to helping (Liberty coach Sandy Brondello) coach our team to a win.\u201d",
      "Clark was supposed to compete in a loaded 3-point contest Friday night and is captain of one of the All-Star teams. The second-year guard was the leading vote getter from the fans and has been a huge reason the league has had a boon in attendance and ratings over the last two seasons.",
      "Clark sat out the team\u2019s 98-77 loss against New York.",
      "Fever coach Stephanie White said Clark had imaging done Wednesday afternoon and deferred to the team\u2019s training staff for more details except to say that she considered it good news.",
      "Clark got hurt with under a minute left. She walked downcourt holding her right groin after assisting on the Fever\u2019s final basket. As teammate Aliyah Boston tried to console her, Clark walked to the basket stanchion and banged her head against it before heading to the bench. During the timeout, she covered her head with a towel and appeared to be holding back tears.",
      "Clark had been durable throughout college and her first season in the WNBA, never missing a game. Now she\u2019s had four different muscle injuries so far this year.",
      "She missed the preseason opener with tightness in her quad but played the next day in an exhibition game at her alma mater, Iowa. She suffered a quad strain against New York on May 24 that kept her out for five games. Clark returned June 14 and played in five games before suffering another injury to her left groin that kept her out for four contests and the Commissioner\u2019s Cup final.",

      "Spidercam \u2014 that's a camera, not a super hero \u2014 was used in golf for the first time at Royal Portrush on Thursday. It\u2019s a camera suspended above the 18th green using four pylons about 25 meters high, giving TV viewers unique views of the closing hole and its undulations.",
      "Held in a resting position high to the back of the green for approach shots, Spidercam swoops down as the players make their walk to the green and hovers just above them as they make their putts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool the way it can move and do all those swings,\u201d said Northern Irish golfer Tom McKibbin, who went out at 6:35 a.m. local time in the first group of the day with Nicolai Hojgaard and Padraig Harrington.",
      "They were the first players to experience in competition the technology which reportedly cost the R&A 300,000 pounds ($400,000) to install.",
      "\u201cIt was a little bit different,\u201d McKibbin said. \u201cI\u2019d never seen it before.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s because the R&A is using the technology before any of the professional tours in golf.",
      "Spidercam has, though, operated widely in TV coverage of other major sports including soccer, rugby and cricket \u2014 and has occasionally gotten in the way.",
      "In 2017, India star MS Dhoni hit a shot in a cricket match against England that smashed into the hovering camera and broke it.",
      "In 2022, South Africa cricketer Anrich Nortje was knocked to the ground when he collided with a low-swinging Spidercam as he walked to his place in the field in a test against Australia. The camera operator responsible was stood down for the remainder of the match.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know what hit me,\u201d Nortje said at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be travelling at head height.\"",
      "At Royal Portrush, Spidercam will complement existing technology such as a plane camera, aerial drones and bunker cameras to enhance TV coverage.",
      "According to the Guardian newspaper, players were briefed last week about plans to use Spidercam at Royal Portrush and there were no complaints despite the potential for getting distracted while preparing to make a shot.",
      "As Hojgaard and Harrington walked alongside each other to the 18th green, Spidercam swung down and over them. As Harrington made his two putts, the camera almost circled him.",
      "Hojgaard said he didn\u2019t notice Spidercam.",
      "With Royal Portrush not having a clubhouse on the 18th green, there has been space to install the technology. Other venues on the Open rotation won't have that luxury, notably Royal Lytham St. Anne's, Royal Troon and Hoylake.",
      "Next year's Open is at Royal Birkdale, which has its clubhouse near the 18th green but should still have room for the Spidercam technology.",
      "\u201cWe ... believe that Spidercam will bring millions of fans a new perspective of the action from Royal Portrush,\u201d said Neil Armit, chief commercial officer at the R&A, \"with incredible detail and accessibility wherever they are in the world.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Altchek, who performed more than 2,000 Tommy John surgeries and was the New York Mets longtime medical director, died Thursday. He was 68.",
      "His death was announced by the Hospital for Special Surgery, where he was co-chief emeritus. Altchek told associates last year he had been diagnosed with a brain tumor.",
      "He was the Mets head team physician from 1991-2001 and medical director from 2005-24, physician of the U.S. Davis Cup team from 1999-2003 and North American medical director of the ATP Tour. Altchek was co-chief of HSS's sports medicine and shoulder service from 2005-14.",
      "\u201cWhile Dr. Altchek\u2019s intelligence and innovations certainly benefited his patients \u2014 and sports medicine in general \u2014 his biggest impact was his warm, friendly, caring personality,\u201d said Glenn S. Fleisig, biomechanics research director of the American Sports Medicine Institute. \u201cColleagues, friends, and patients all loved David and are thankful for the time we had with him.\u201d",
      "A son of orthopedic surgeon Martin Altchek, David attended Middletown High School in New York, received his undergraduate degree at Columbia and his medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1982. He interned at The New York Hospital and became a resident at HSS, where he had a fellowship under Dr. Russell Warren, HSS's surgeon in chief from 1993-03 and a longtime team physician of the New York Giants.",
      "\u201cMy first Tommy John surgery was in 1993, and I did the procedure that Dr. Jobe, Dr. Frank Jobe prescribed,\u201d Altchek said during a 2024 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt took 2 1/2 hours and I was exhausted. And I realized then that we had to do something about Tommy John surgery. We had to make it a little bit easier.\u201d",
      "Working with residents and fellows, Altchek developed what was called a docking procedure and tested it on about 100 elbows.",
      "\u201cIt worked and it worked amazingly well,\u201d Altchek said. \u201cWe really did not change it at all for 20-something years.\"",
      "Altchek estimated last year he had performed more than 2,400 Tommy John surgeries. He was a preferred surgeon for the Tommy John procedure in recent years along with Texas Rangers physician Dr. Keith Meister and Los Angeles Dodgers head team physician Dr. Neal ElAttrache.",
      "Part of Altchek's job was to reassure a player his baseball career was not over.",
      "\u201cYou tell them this is unfortunate, but this is your MRI. This is probably why it happened \u2014 meaning you threw outside the envelope of your tissue quality,\" he explained. \"But we have a procedure that can repair your ligament and reconstruct it in a kind of belt, suspenders way that once it heals the likelihood of you going back to pitching at the same level or above is 95%.\u201d",
      "Altchek received Columbia's John Jay Award for Distinguished Professional Achievement in 2003.",
      "He is survived by his wife, the former Anne Salmson, whom he married in 1981, sons Charles and Christopher, and daughters Chloe and Sophie. Charles is president of Major League Soccer's third-tier MLS Next Pro minor league and was the Ivy League men's soccer player of the year while at Harvard in 2005 and 2006.",

      "The SEC Media Days this week highlighted the ongoing rivalry between the SEC and the Big Ten in college football",
      "ATLANTA -- There was not a Big Ten player, coach or fan was in sight this week as the College Football Hall of Fame hosted SEC Media Days. Still, the SEC\u2019s No. 1 rival found its way into conversations all week long.",
      "It\u2019s no secret the rivalry has intensified in recent years. Over the last decade, the SEC has won six of the 10 national championships. Two were won by Clemson in that stretch but the last two were won by Big Ten rivals, Michigan last year and Ohio State in January.",
      "The recent success has put a dent in the SEC\u2019s reputation as the nation's dominant conference. SEC coaches, players and Commissioner Greg Sankey have no question they\u2019re still No. 1.",
      "\u201cFor all those of you who like to speculate about super-conferences, welcome to one,\" Sankey said to open this week's event. \"We have common-sense geography, restored rivalries, record-breaking viewership. If you take the consumed viewership hours on linear TV, almost 40% of that viewership was focused on games involving Southeastern Conference universities and teams. Big Ten was next, right around 30%.\u201d",
      "The SEC also boasted 79 NFL draft picks in 2025, more than any other conference and beating the Big Ten by eight.",
      "No one put it more plainly this week than Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz when asked if he thought the SEC was the top conference in college football.",
      "\u201cThe top? The top, as in number of draft picks in the NFL? Top as in most viewership? Overall top, deepest conference in college football? Look, the more teams you add to the tournament, there\u2019s greater variance to it,\u201d Drinkwitz said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got 16 of the toughest competitors in the world who are head coaches in this league. We\u2019re all driven to achieve the best, whether that\u2019s internally or externally.\u201d",
      "The Big Ten and SEC draw outsized attention in college football for other reasons. The two will soon have a bigger say over the format of the College Football Playoff \u2014 they currently differ on that \u2014 and their teams are in the mix for the top recruits every year.",
      "Early bragging rights this season between the two behemoths include Texas at Ohio State in a CFP rematch from last season, Michigan at Oklahoma and Wisconsin at Alabama, all before mid-September. The real measuring stick in this league rivalry is always going to be the postseason.",
      "Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer knows excellence is the expectation when it comes to SEC football.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s our responsibility, to be at the top, right? That\u2019s the expectation. I know at Alabama, but also the expectation for the SEC as a whole. I still feel that the SEC top to bottom is as strong as you\u2019ll find,\u201d DeBoer said.",
      "DeBoer isn't wrong when he says it\u2019s the expectation. In fact, it\u2019s the standard and fan bases from Austin to Gainesville go beyond team cheers on game day. \u201cS-E-C, S-E-C\u201d chants on a fall Saturday are not a rare occurrence.",
      "The excitement is part of what drew Cam Ball to Arkansas.",
      "\u201cGrowing up, my father would wake me up on Saturdays. If we didn\u2019t go to the barber shop, we was at home, just sitting on the couch watching the game, mainly watching SEC games,\u201d he said.",
      "Playing in the conference he grew up watching still feels surreal.",
      "\u201cSometimes in a game, it\u2019s the first play, and I\u2019ll just look up and see an SEC opponent\u2019s helmet, and I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m really here. God is good.\u2019 This conference in general, it\u2019s just a blessing to be here,\u201d Ball said.",
      "Alex Afari Jr.'s recruiting journey ended promptly after receiving the call from Kentucky. It was his first and only SEC offer. The decision was easy: Who wouldn\u2019t want to play SEC ball?",
      "\u201cPlaying in the SEC means a lot,\" Afari said. \"I always want to play against the best players. When I got the SEC offer and that\u2019s my only one \u2014 I had like Big Ten offers or whatever, but this is my only SEC offer, and I took that chance.\u201d",
      "To Afari, no other conference compares.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not even close, really. I feel like we just got the o-linemen, the d-linemen are just different, the skill players as well. We put the most players in the NFL,\" he said. \u201cEvery SEC team can beat each other, every SEC team is not weak, so I feel like that\u2019s the difference. We don\u2019t have any bad teams in the SEC.\u201d",

      "Watt, who was entering the final season of the four-year extension he signed in 2021, is scheduled to make $123 million over the course of the three-year agreement, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the contract had not yet been made public.",
      "ESPN first reported the extension.",
      "Watt appeared to celebrate by making a rare Instagram post on Thursday afternoon, sharing a picture of him flexing in his signature No. 90 jersey. Watt also posted a photo in his Instagram stories of him posing alongside prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and third-year Steelers outside linebacker Nick Herbig.",
      "The average annual value of $41 million eclipses the previous record contract for a defender set by Cleveland defensive lineman and reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett in March.",
      "The value also eclipses the average salary of Bengals wide receiver Ja\u2019Marr Chase, who became the league\u2019s highest-paid non-quarterback after agreeing to a new contract worth $40.25 million a season.",
      "The fact that Watt\u2019s extension is worth 2.5% more per season than Garrett\u2019s (whose overall total value of $204 million is still higher than Watt\u2019s) is not a coincidence. Watt, the 2021 Defensive Player of the Year and a four-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowler, has long believed he is the best edge rusher in the NFL.",
      "For the second time in four years, he\u2019s being paid like it.",
      "Watt, who turns 31 in November, took the unusual step of skipping mandatory minicamp last month in hopes of putting pressure on Pittsburgh\u2019s front office to get something done. Head coach Mike Tomlin brushed off Watt\u2019s absence, saying it was only a matter of time before things worked themselves out.",
      "The timing couldn\u2019t be better. The new-look Steelers \u2014 now led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers \u2014 report to training camp at Saint Vincent College next Wednesday.",
      "They\u2019ll do it with a familiar face in tow. Watt, who tied an NFL record by racking up 22 1/2 sacks in 2021, is the linchpin of a defense that will be relied on heavily if the Steelers want to end a playoff drought that stretches back to the 2016 AFC Championship, a few months before the Steelers selected Watt with the 30th overall pick in the 2017 draft.",

      "Local media in India reported that Singh sustained severe head injuries in a hit-and-run accident on Monday while he was crossing the road at his native village near Jalandhar in Punjab. He was taken to the hospital where he later died. His London-based running club and charity, Sikhs In The City, confirmed his death.",

      "Singh became the oldest man to run a full marathon in 2011 at the age of 100 in Toronto. His accomplishment was not recognized by Guinness World Records because he did not have a birth certificate to prove his age. Singh had a British passport that showed his date of birth as April 1, 1911, while a letter from Indian government officials stated that birth records were not kept in 1911.",
      "A torchbearer for the 2012 London Olympics, Singh took up running at the age of 89 as a way to get over depression after his wife and son died in quick succession in India. The death in 1994 of his son took a particularly hard toll on him because of its grisly nature.",

      "Clark received a 10-year exemption for winning the U.S. Open at Los Angeles Country Club in 2023. The exemption ends in 2033, the next time Oakmont is to host the U.S. Open. The storied club has held the U.S. Open nine times, the most of any U.S. Open site.",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years \u2014 including one that shook communities almost exactly two years earlier.",
      "Officials said Thursday they had received no reports of injuries or major damage from the latest event, which triggered a tsunami warning that lasted about an hour before being downgraded and prompted communities along a 700-mile (1,127-km) stretch of Alaska\u2019s southern coast to urge people to move to higher ground. The official maximum wave height at Sand Point, a community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of the epicenter, was about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling, a lead duty scientist at the National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred at low tide.",
      "The earthquake struck at 12:37 p.m. local time, prompting the center's tsunami warning.",
      "There are a number of ways people in warning areas can receive notifications, including the sounding of sirens in communities that have them, listening to weather radio or public radio broadcasts, following official accounts on social media, or via push alerts on cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door to door, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state's emergency management division.",
      "Public safety departments in King Cove and Unalaska sent alerts urging those in coastal areas or those that could see inundation to seek higher ground.",
      "The warning issued by the center was downgraded to an advisory before being canceled around 2:45 p.m.",
      "Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state in the U.S. and one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The state experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost annually, and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage, the agency said. That 1964 magnitude 9.2 earthquake \u2014 and the tsunami it triggered \u2014 killed about 130 people.",
      "The Aleutian arc is no stranger to earthquakes, but the activity in the region where Wednesday's earthquake struck has gotten scientists' attention. The area, within a few hundred miles of the earthquake, has \u201clit up\u201d since 2020, with Wednesday's earthquake marking the fifth exceeding magnitude 7.0 since 2020, said state seismologist Michael West.",
      "\u201cI would not call this an isolated earthquake. It appears to be part of a larger sequence spanning the last several years,\" he said. But West added: \u201cThere's no reason to be alarmist about this.\u201d",
      "Some communities have buildings designated on higher ground as meetup points during tsunami warnings, such as a school, while others might simply urge residents to retreat up a hillside, Zidek said.",
      "\u201cThat area of Alaska, most areas of Alaska, it gets steep real quick,\u201d he said.",
      "Sometimes, the only warning one might have is the shaking ground, Zidek said. \u201cIf it shakes violently for 20 seconds or more, that is your warning sign, and you should head to higher ground if you\u2019re in a coastal area,\u201d he said.",
      "Zidek and West said people should continue to heed warnings. West said he worries about a \u201cburnout effect\u201d among residents in the region, some of whom have evacuated numerous times since 2018 in response to larger earthquakes that have not caused significant damage.",
      "West said he is reminded of a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in 1946 \u2014 west of the location of Wednesday's quake \u2014 that generated a deadly tsunami and led to the creation of a U.S. tsunami warning system. The death toll included more than 150 people in Hawaii, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cThis area is capable of trans-Pacific tsunamis, and I feel like maybe the best way to stay vigilant ... is maybe to look into our deeper history beyond just the last five years,\u201d he said.",

      "TALLINN, Estonia -- A snappy tune by a blogger that mockingly laments his poor internet connection in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don has gotten over a half-million views on Instagram in two weeks.",
      "\u201cHow to say you\u2019re from Rostov without saying a word? Show one bar of cellphone service,\" Pavel Osipyan raps while walking around the city, smartphone in hand. \"We have internet until 12 o'clock, and recently there\u2019s been no connection at all. No need to be angry, just get used to it already.\u201d",
      "The complaints by Osipyan \u2014 unable to pay electronically for groceries, or having to use paper maps while driving \u2014 aren't isolated to Rostov-on-Don, which borders Ukraine and, as home to Russia's Southern Military District, is targeted frequently by drones.",
      "In the last two months, cellphone internet shutdowns, which officials say are needed to foil Ukrainian drones, have hit dozens of Russian regions \u2014 from those near the fighting to parts of Siberia and even the Far East. Some Wi-Fi outages also have been reported.",
      "Russians contacted by The Associated Press talked about card payments not going through, taxi and ride-sharing apps not working properly, ATMs that sometimes fail.",
      "Experts point to the unprecedented nature of the measures and warn of far-reaching consequences in a country where the Kremlin already has significantly curtailed online freedom.",
      "Such shutdowns in the name of security legitimize them to the public and open the door for authorities abusing the restrictions, said Anastasiya Zhyrmont, policy manager for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at the Access Now digital rights group.",
      "Experts say the trend began in May, when Russia celebrated the 80th anniversary of the defeat of the Nazi Germany in World War II and foreign dignitaries flocked to Moscow for a big military parade.",
      "The capital suffered severe disruptions of cellphone connectivity to the internet for days, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed those were deliberate restrictions due to regular Ukrainian drone attacks. Asked how long they'd last, he replied, \"This will be done as needed.\u201d",
      "Russia has restricted smartphone connectivity before, with isolated instances during protests, as well as in regions bordering Ukraine.",
      "Shutdowns in the capital, however, sent a signal to authorities across the vast country that it\u2019s a useful tool, said lawyer Sarkis Darbinyan, founder of Russian internet freedom group Roskomsvoboda.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s \"Operation Spiderweb\u201d in early June, in which drones launched from containers on trucks attacked airfields deep inside Russia, made officials all the more eager to take action, Darbinyan said.",
      "\u201cThey got really scared that drones now may appear, like a jack-in-the-box, in any Russian regions,\u201d he told AP.",
      "By mid-July, deliberate shutdowns spread to most of the country, according to Na Svyazi \u2014 Russian for \u201cstaying connected\u201d \u2014 an activist group tracking internet availability.",
      "On Tuesday, the group reported cellphone internet shutdowns in 73 of over 80 regions. In 41 of them, there were reports of broadband network outages as well, while restrictions on broadband internet occurred in six regions, while cellphone connections were fine.",
      "Some regional officials confirmed that cellphone internet was restricted for security reasons. Nizhny Novgorod Gov. Gleb Nikitin said this month the measure will stay in place in the region east of Moscow for \u201cas long as the threat remains.\u201d",
      "Asked Thursday whether such mass shutdowns were justified, Peskov said \u201ceverything that has to do with ensuring the safety of citizens, everything is justified and everything is a priority.\u201d",
      "Russians from affected regions say the outages can last for hours or days; patterns also are hard to discern, with service working in one part of a city but vanishing elsewhere.",
      "In Voronezh, near Ukraine and frequently targeted by drones, one resident said she felt like she was in \u201ca cave\u201d in early July with no cellphone internet or Wi-Fi in her home. The woman, who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said she was only able to get online at work the next day.",
      "Cellphone internet in the southwestern city of Samara \"goes out at the most unpredictable moments,\u201d said Natalia, who also spoke on condition that her last name be withheld for safety reasons. Her home Wi-Fi recently also has slowed to a near halt around 11 p.m., staying that way for a few hours, she said.",
      "Connectivity has improved recently in the Siberian city of Omsk, said Viktor Shkurenko, who owns retail stores and other businesses there. But cellphone internet service was out in his office for an entire week. A few of his smaller stores that rely on cellphone networks suffered disruptions, but nothing critical, he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel any super strong discomfort,\" said Grigori Khromov of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia\u2019s fifth-largest city where regular and widespread shutdowns were reported. \"I have an office job and I work either at home or in the office and have either wire internet or Wi-Fi.\u201d",
      "In rural areas, small towns and villages, where cellphone internet often is the only way to get online, the situation was harder to gauge.",
      "Pharmacies in such areas have struggled, Russian media reported and the Independent Pharmacies Association confirmed to AP. Viktoria Presnyakova, head of the association, said in a statement that prescriptions must be logged in special software, but that becomes impossible without an internet connection for weeks.",
      "A social media user in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine complained on Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov\u2019s social media page that without cellphone internet and a working alarm system, village residents have to bang on a rail to warn neighbors of an attack. The authorities promised to look into improving connectivity in the area.",
      "Authorities elsewhere also announced steps to minimize disruptions by opening Wi-Fi spots. They also are reportedly planning to establish an agency to coordinate the shutdowns, according to Izvestia, a Kremlin-backed newspaper that cited unidentified government sources. Peskov said he was unaware of the plan.",
      "Russian and Ukrainian drones use cellphone internet networks to operate, so shutdowns are one way authorities try to counter the attacks, said Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.",
      "But it's also part of the Kremlin's long-term effort to rein in the internet. Authorities have actively censored online content in the last decade, blocking thousands of websites of independent media, opposition groups and human rights organizations.",
      "After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as encrypted messenger platform Signal and a few other messaging apps.",
      "Access to YouTube \u2014 wildly popular in Russia \u2014 was disrupted last year in what experts called deliberate throttling by the authorities. The Kremlin blamed YouTube owner Google for not properly maintaining its hardware in Russia.",
      "State internet watchdogs routinely block virtual private network services that help circumvent the restrictions, and there are plans to introduce a national messenger app, expected to replace foreign ones.",
      "Along with the shutdowns, these are part of a larger campaign \u201cto establish control over the internet, which is something the Kremlin had failed to do 20 years prior on the same level that China did,\u201d said the ISW's Stepanenko.",
      "Access Now's Zhyrmont says it's \u201cvery disturbing\u201d that Russians have gotten used to living with growing internet restrictions, including shutdowns.",

      "The Trump administration has revoked $4 billion in federal funding for California's long-delayed high speed rail project",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration revoked federal funding for California's high-speed rail project on Wednesday, intensifying uncertainty about how the state will make good on its long-delayed promise of building a bullet train to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "The U.S. Transportation Department announced it was pulling back $4 billion in funding for the project, weeks after signaling it would do so. Overall, a little less than a quarter of the project's funding has come from the federal government. The rest has come from the state, mainly through a voter-approved bond and money from its cap-and-trade program.",
      "President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy both have slammed the project as a \u201ctrain to nowhere.\"",
      "\u201cThe Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.\u201d",
      "The loss marks the latest blow to California by the Trump administration, which has blocked a first-in-the-nation rule to phase out the sale of new gas-powered cars, launched investigations into university admission policies and threatened to pull funding over transgender girls being allowed to compete in girls sports.",
      "It also comes as rail project leaders are seeking private investment to help pay for its estimated price tag of more than $100 billion.",
      "Voters first approved the project in 2008 and it was supposed to be operating this decade. But cost estimates have consistently grown and its timeline pushed back.",
      "State officials are now focused on building a 119-mile (192-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced that is set to be operating by 2033. The California High Speed Rail Authority is slated to release a report this summer to state lawmakers with an updated funding plan and timeline for the project.",
      "Authority officials wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Trump administration made up its mind about revoking funding before thoroughly reviewing the project. They noted that more than 50 structures have already been built, including underpasses, viaducts and bridges to separate the rail line from roadways for safety.",
      "\u201cCanceling these grants without cause isn\u2019t just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s illegal,\u201d authority CEO Ian Choudri said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese are legally binding agreements, and the Authority has met every obligation, as confirmed by repeated federal reviews, as recently as February 2025.\"",
      "The authority has asked potential private investors to express their interest by the end of the month.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will keep \u201call options on the table\u201d to fight the revocation of federal funds.",
      "\u201cTrump wants to hand China the future and abandon the Central Valley. We won\u2019t let him,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The state has \u201cno viable plan\u201d to complete even the Central Valley segment, said Drew Feeley, acting administrator of the transportation department's Federal Railroad Administration, in a report released last month. He called the project a \u201cstory of broken promises\u201d and a waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "California Democrats also have criticized project spending. Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said at a budget hearing earlier this year that her constituents \u201coverwhelmingly believe\u201d high-speed rail spending \u201chas been irresponsible.\u201d",
      "Newsom plans to extend the state's cap-and-trade program, a key funding source for the project which is set to expire at the end of 2030, through 2045.",
      "The program sets a declining limit on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions large emitters can release. Those polluters can buy allowances from the state needed to pollute, and about 45% of that money goes into what's known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, according to the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that reviews the program.",
      "The fund helps pay for climate and transportation projects, including high-speed rail.",
      "The bullet train project receives 25% of the money from the fund, which ends up being a little less or a little more than $1 billion annually, depending on the year. Newsom in May proposed guaranteeing $1 billion a year for the project from the fund, but lawmakers have not agreed to that.",

      "OpenAI should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is \u201ctoo consequential\u201d to be governed by a corporation alone.",
      "That is the message from an advisory board convened by OpenAI to give it recommendations about its nonprofit structure \u2014 delivered in a report released Thursday, along with a sweeping vision for democratizing AI and reforming philanthropy.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s too important to entrust to any one sector, the private sector or even the government sector,\u201d said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. \u201cThe nonprofit model allows for what we call a common sector,\u201d that facilitates democratic participation.",
      "The recommendations are not binding on OpenAI, but the advisory commission, which includes the labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers a framework that may be used to judge OpenAI in the future, whether or not they adopt it.",
      "In the commission's view, communities that are already feeling the impacts of AI technologies should have input on how they are developed, including how data about them is used. But there are currently few avenues for people to influence tech companies who control much of the development of AI.",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted its CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023. He was reinstated days later and continues to lead OpenAI.",
      "It has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorney generals in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI.",
      "Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares in that new corporation, but OpenAI has not said how much.",
      "Zingale said Huerta told the commission their challenge was to help make sure AI is a blessing and not a curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision a nonprofit with an expansive mandate to help everyone participate in the development and trajectory of AI.",
      "\u201cThe measure of this nonprofit will be in what it builds, who it includes, and how faithfully it endures to mission and impact,\" they wrote.",
      "The commission toured California communities and solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired by OpenAI\u2019s mission to create artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and ensure those benefits are felt widely and evenly.",
      "But, Zingale said many people feel they are in the dark about how it\u2019s happening.",
      "\u201cThey know this is profoundly important what\u2019s happening in this \u2018Age of Intelligence,\u2019 but they want to understand better what it is, how it\u2019s developed, where are the important choices being made and who\u2019s making them?\u201d he said.",
      "Zingale said the commission chose early on not to interact with Altman in any way in order to maintain their independence, though they quote him in their report. However, they did speak with the company\u2019s senior engineers, who they said, \u201centered our space with humility, seriousness, and a genuine desire to understand how their work might translate into democratic legitimacy.\u201d",
      "The commission proposed OpenAI immediately provide significant resources to the nonprofit for use in the public interest. For context, the nonprofit reported $23 million in assets in 2023, the most recent year that its tax filing is available.",
      "The commission recommend focusing on closing gaps in economic opportunity, investing in AI literacy and creating an organization that is accessible to and governed by everyday people.",
      "\u201cFor OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit to fulfill its mandate, it should commit to more than just doing good - it should commit to being known, seen, and shaped by the people it claims to serve,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The commission suggested opening a rapid response fund to help reduce economic strains now. Zingale said they specifically recommended funding theater, art and health.",
      "\u201cWe're trying to make the point that they need to dedicate some of their resources to human to human activities,\u201d he said.",
      "The commission also recommended setting up a requirement that a human lead the nonprofit, which Zingale said is a serious recommendation and \u201ca sign of the times.\"",

      "A coalition of funders, including the Gates Foundation and Ballmer Group, will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools for public defenders, parole officers, social workers and others who help Americans in precarious situations.",
      "The funders announced Thursday that they will create a new entity, NextLadder Ventures, to offer grants and investments to nonprofits and for-profits to develop tools for those who often manage huge caseloads with few resources.",
      "\u201cThe solutions that we\u2019re investing in, the hundreds of entrepreneurs that are going to bring forward solutions that incorporate leading edge technologies, are going to do it by coming alongside people who are living through some of the struggles in the economy,\u201d said Brian Hooks, CEO of Stand Together, a nonprofit started by Kansas-based billionaire Charles Koch.",
      "The other funders include hedge fund founder John Overdeck and Valhalla Foundation, which was started by Inuit cofounder Steve Cook and his wife Signe Ostby. Ballmer Group is the philanthropy of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie. The funders declined to reveal the exact financial commitments made by each of the contributors.",
      "The point of investing in these AI tools is to spur economic mobility, a focus all the funders share, they said. The funders believe there are many ideas for how AI technologies could help match people with resources after a disaster or an eviction, for example, or help a parole officer close out more cases for people who have met all of the criteria but are waiting for the paperwork to be processed.",
      "\u201cAs we traded notes on where we were making investments and where we saw broader gaps in the sector, it was readily apparent that there was a real opportunity to come together as a group of cofunders and cofounders to establish a new kind of investment organization,\u201d said Kevin Bromer, who leads the technology and data strategy at Ballmer Group. He will also serve as a member on NextLadder's board, which will include three independent board members and representatives from the other funders.",
      "NextLadder will be led by Ryan Rippel, who previously directed the Gates Foundation's economic mobility portfolio. The funder group has not yet determined if NextLadder will incorporate as a nonprofit or a for profit organization but said any returns they make from investments will go back into funding new initiatives.",
      "NextLadder will partner with AI company Anthropic, which will offer technical expertise and access to its technologies to the nonprofits and companies it invests in. Anthropic has committed around $1.5 million annually to the partnership, said Elizabeth Kelly, its head of beneficial deployments, which is a team that focuses on giving back to society.",
      "\u201cWe want to hand-hold grantees through their use of Claude with the same care and commitment we provide to our largest enterprise customers,\u201d Kelly said, referencing Anthropic's large language model.",
      "Hooks, of Stand Together, said philanthropy can reduce the riskiness of these types of investments and offer organizations more time to prove out their ideas.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re successful, this will be the first capital to demonstrate what\u2019s possible,\u201d Hooks said.",
      "Researchers like those at the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in humanitarian action have studied some of the risks associated with using AI tools when interacting with sensitive populations or handling high-stakes interactions, for example, in humanitarian contexts.",
      "They recommend assessing whether AI is the best tool to solve the problem and, crucially, if it works reliably and accurately enough in high-risk settings. They also recommend assessing tools for bias, considering privacy protections and weighing the cost of potential dependence on a specific provider.",
      "The National Institute of Standards and Technology also emphasizes that trustworthy AI systems should be accountable to users and that it should be possible to explain or trace how a tool arrived at a certain conclusion or decision.",
      "Hooks emphasized that any AI tools NextLadder invests in will be shaped by the needs and feedback of these frontline workers. Tools that don't work for them, won't succeed, he said. Even with the potential risks of AI tools, he said it's imperative that groups that are struggling to move up the economic ladder have access to new technologies.",

      "\u201cElected officials do a tremendous amount of public speaking,\u201d said Mayor Matt Mahan, whose recent itinerary has taken him from new restaurant and semiconductor startup openings to a festival of lowriding car culture.",
      "Other politicians might be skittish admitting a chatbot co-wrote their speech or that it helped draft a $5.6 billion budget for the new fiscal year, but Mahan is trying to lead by example, pushing a growing number of the nearly 7,000 government workers running Silicon Valley's biggest city to embrace artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Mahan said adopting AI tools will eliminate drudge work and help the city better serve its roughly 1 million residents.",
      "He\u2019s hardly the only public or private sector executive directing an AI-or-bust strategy, though in some cases, workers have found that the costly technology can add hassles or mistakes.",
      "\u201cThe idea is to try things, be really transparent, look for problems, flag them, share them across different government agencies, and then work with vendors and internal teams to problem solve,\u201d Mahan said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s always bumpy with new technologies.\u201d",
      "By next year, the city intends to have 1,000, or about 15%, of its workers trained to use AI tools for a variety of tasks, including pothole complaint response, bus routing and using vehicle-tracking surveillance cameras to solve crimes.",
      "One of San Jose's early adopters was Andrea Arjona Amador, who leads electric mobility programs at the city\u2019s transportation department. She has already used ChatGPT to secure a $12 million grant for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "Arjona Amador set up a customized \u201cAI agent\u201d to review the correspondence she was receiving about various grant proposals and asked it to help organize the incoming information, including due dates. Then, she had it help draft the 20-page document.",
      "So far, San Jose has spent more than $35,000 to purchase 89 ChatGPT licenses -- at $400 per account -- for city workers to use.",
      "\u201cThe way it used to work, before I started using this, we spent a lot of evenings and weekends trying to get grants to the finish line,\u201d she said. The Trump administration later rescinded the funding, so she pitched a similar proposal to a regional funder not tied to the federal government.",

      "With close relationships to some of the tech industry's biggest players, including San Francisco-based OpenAI and Mountain View-based Google, the mayors of the Bay Area's biggest cities are helping to promote the type of AI adoption that the tech industry is striving for, while also promising guidelines and standards to avoid the technology's harms.",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced a plan Monday to give nearly 30,000 city workers, including nurses and social workers, access to Microsoft\u2019s Copilot chatbot, which is based on the same technology that powers ChatGPT. San Francisco's plan says it comes with \u201crobust privacy and bias safeguards, and clear guidelines to ensure technology enhances \u2014 not replaces \u2014 human judgment.\u201d",
      "San Jose has similar guidelines and hasn't yet reported any major mishaps with its pilot projects. Such problems have attracted attention elsewhere because of the technology's propensity to spew false information, known as hallucinations.",

      "He added, however, that \"you still need a human being in the loop. You can\u2019t just kind of press a couple of buttons and trust the output. You still have to do some independent verification. You have to have logic and common sense and ask questions.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, when OpenAI introduced a new pilot product called Operator, it promised a new kind of tool that went beyond a chatbot's capabilities. Instead of just analyzing documents and producing passages of text, it could also access a computer system and schedule calendars or perform tasks on a person's behalf.

      "China's Ministry of State Security says it is cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths materials that it says threaten national security",
      "BANGKOK -- China's state security agency says it is cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths minerals that it says threaten national security, just weeks after Beijing and Washington agreed to make it easier for American firms to obtain from China those materials, which are critical for manufacturing and computer chip production.",
      "In a report published Friday in the state-run newspaper Global Times, the Ministry of State Security said foreign \u201cespionage and intelligence agencies\u201d were colluding to steal rare earths-related goods by repackaging and relabeling rare metals to hide their Chinese origin.",
      "In some cases the minerals were falsely declared as non-controlled items, mislabeled as such things as \u201csolder paste,\u201d mixed into other materials like ceramic tiles, or hidden in plastic mannequins or bottled water, it said.",
      "It referred only to an unnamed \u201ccertain country\u201d that it said lacked the capacity to make and refine its own rare earths.",
      "Investigations had found Chinese criminals were involved, exploiting shipping and delivery channels to evade controls on exports of the materials used in many high-tech applications including electric vehicle batteries, it said.",
      "The crackdown followed a report by Reuters earlier this month detailing how rare earths were being transshipped to the U.S. via Thailand and Mexico.",
      "China is the main source for many strategically vital rare earths and it has moved to slow exports of such minerals in retaliation for steep import duties President Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese goods since he returned to the White House and launched his crusade to overturn a global trading system he says is unfair to the United States and its workers.",
      "That followed an earlier series of restrictions by Beijing on exports of such materials as gallium, germanium, antimony and tungsten in response to trade friction with the administration of then-President Joe Biden.",
      "In April, Beijing imposed permitting requirements on seven rare earth elements, under a Chinese law that applies to all exports, not just those bound for the U.S. market.",
      "With the permitting process taking 45 days, the new requirement caused a pause in shipments, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world. The U.S., meanwhile, added to restrictions on exports of advanced technologies to China.",
      "Rare earths have remained at the center of China-U.S. talks aimed at staving off huge tariff increases that were postponed in May to allow time for negotiations on a broader trade agreement. The deadline for reaching a deal is Aug. 12.",
      "An agreement announced in late June did not remove China\u2019s permitting requirement on rare earths, but Beijing agreed to flexibility in dialing up or down the approval process as needed.",
      "Computer chips are another key bone of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Friday that it had taken note of a decision by the Trump administration to lift restrictions on exports of key semiconductors used in artificial intelligence made by Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices.",
      "In April, the Trump administration announced it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China \u2014 as well as MI308 chips from AMD.",
      "But Commerce Ministry spokesman Wang Wentao said restoring healthy trade ties will require more action by Washington.",
      "U.S. export controls on Ascend chips made by Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies have hurt the interests of Chinese companies, Wang told reporters in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the United States and China will meet each other halfway and correct their wrong practices through equal consultation, create a good environment for mutually beneficial cooperation between enterprises of both sides, and jointly maintain the stability of the global semiconductor production and supply chain,\u201d he said.",

      "For 37 years in a searing California desert, runners from across the globe have embarked on a 135-mile race through one of the hottest places on Earth",
      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- When the running gets hard in this desert dubbed \u201chell on Earth,\u201d Danny Westergaard tells himself: \u201cSlow and steady\u201d or \u201csmooth as butter.\u201d",
      "For 18 years, Westergaard, 66, has braved the scorching summer heat of California\u2019s Death Valley in an ultramarathon billed as the world\u2019s toughest. Last week, 99 runners from across the globe embarked on a grueling 135 mile (217.26 kilometer) competition from the lowest point below sea level of North America to the trailhead of the highest peak in the contiguous U.S. They had 48 hours to do it. Few have completed the competition as many times as Westergaard, though finishing is not a given.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just become like a summer ritual and a family reunion,\" he said. \u201cI feel at home when I\u2019m here. It\u2019s my tribe.\u201d",
      "For the 37th year, the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon challenged athletes to withstand stretches of this dry, searing desert. The race takes place in July, when temperatures have soared into the 130s F (54.44s C). Even as a place of extremes, Death Valley is not immune to global warming. Seven of its hottest summers have occurred in the past 10 years, according to the National Park Service. And if planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, more places could experience its broiling temperatures.",
      "Over two days, Westergaard would trek up and down mountain ranges, past sand dunes and salt flats, through quaint towns and vast desertscapes amid temperatures as high as 117 F (47.22 C). He tried to smile throughout, even when he felt miserable.",
      "\u201cIt just lifts you up,\u201d he said of smiling so others smile back.",
      "At 8 p.m., the first wave of runners take off. Westergaard jogs up a ramp into the pale light of dusk. It\u2019s 113 F (45 C), and it feels like a blow dryer to the face.",
      "Leap frogging in a van behind him is his cheer squad and support crew \u2013 Jennifer Drain, his smiley cousin back for the 17th year, and daughters Meagan, who has attended before, and Madison, a first timer. The crew, who playfully call Westergaard \"wiener dog,\u201d are hauling everything he needs: food, ice, water, electrolytes.",
      "This heat can kill. Soaring body temperatures can lead to organ failure and strain the heart, especially for people with heart disease, and cause heat stroke. To prevent that they keep him cool. They spray mist on him and pour ice into his hat and a bandana wrapped around his neck. His drinking water is ice cold.",
      "A few hours in, Meagan asks her dad if he\u2019s peed. \u201cLong stream,\" he responded of his amount of urine. Staying hydrated is critical. As he sweats, he\u2019s losing liquids that can critically stress kidneys if not replenished. Dehydration can cause organs to fail from lack of blood, oxygen and nutrients, leading to seizures and death.",
      "No runners have died doing the competition, but heat-related issues are common, said Megan Dell, the race's medical director. Stomach issues can lead to vomiting and dehydration. Hyponatremia \u2014 which happens when your blood's sodium is too low \u2014 has sent runners to the hospital.",
      "Westergaard has learned to embrace the rollercoaster. One moment he feels like Superman \u2014 the next he could be throwing up on the side of the road, questioning if he\u2019ll make it. \u201cYou just suck it up, just like in life, and get through the lows, and it always gets better.\u201d",
      "The runners dash toward mile 50.8 (81.75 kilometers), the critical cut off point they must get to by 10 a.m. or be eliminated. The sun is peaking over the mountains, casting a warm glow over dune fields. It\u2019s 85 F (29.44 C).",
      "\u201cLiving the dream, ey?\u201d Westergaard said with a smile, his perky strut now a droopy shuffle.",
      "He pours water on his face and arms and munches some watermelon. Madison paces behind him as they crack jokes. \u201cGet er done! Junior wiener in training!\u201d Meagan yelled.",
      "Westergaard makes it to the cut off point before 9 a.m. It\u2019s 90 F (32.2 C).",
      "Mile 56 (90.12 kilometers): After moving for 14 hours straight, Westergaard rests and eats some avocado toast. \u201cGreat! Let\u2019s motor!\u201d he said after 10 minutes sitting on a chair.",
      "Miles later, he begins his descent into \u201cthe oven\u201d that is Panamint Valley, usually the hottest part of the race during the hottest part of the day. It\u2019s 96 F (35.56 C) and the heat sizzles from above and below. Westergaard runs on the white line on the road because it\u2019s cooler. In hotter years, the asphalt got so hot the bottoms of his shoes felt sticky on the ground.",
      "Westergaard trains year round to acclimate to the heat. As he gets older, he doesn't tolerate heat as well and has slowed down. His two-hour sauna sessions are now one, and he runs a few times a week instead of daily.",
      "\u201cI'm just out there longer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut still getting it done.\u201d",
      "Tony Wolf, kinesiology professor at the University of Georgia, said aging adults generally have reduced heart function compared to younger adults. When combined with the cardiovascular demand of exercise and heat stress, it can cause difficulties.",
      "There isn\u2019t much research about how the bodies of fit older adults, including competitive athletes, regulate internal temperature. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a ton of people in their 60s and older who are doing those kinds of events,\u201d said Wolf.",
      "Studies focused on adults before and after a training program found that exercise improved heart function and thermoregulation. That could suggest that the heart and thermoregulation impairments linked to aging are largely mitigated by lifelong fitness, Wolf said.",
      "The runners are spread out now, their flashing lights twinkling in the distance. This night is the toughest for Westergaard as sleep deprivation sets in. He zigzags on the road, barely awake. The runners ahead of him look like they're running toward him.",
      "In past years, his hallucinations have included people luring him to rest on couches that were actually bushes. Another time, he struck up a conversation with a kid skateboarding by him with a dog. And once, he watched for hours as a guy swung off the edge of the crescent moon, waving down at him.",
      "\u201cIt was just clear as day,\u201d Westergaard said of the hallucination.",
      "At 3:10 a.m. at mile 98 (157.72 kilometers), he sleeps for 15 minutes under the moonlight.",
      "\u201cNo one really quite understands\u201d why he does this, said Madison.",
      "At 11:50 a.m. and around mile 123 (197.95 kilometers), Westergaard shuffles through the town of Lone Pine. Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in the continental U.S., soars some 14,500 feet (4,420 meters) into the blue sky.",
      "A crowd claps and cheers as he runs by.",
      "\u201cGo Danny, go!\u201d yelled a man.",
      "It's 92 F (33.33 C) as he approaches the final 4,750 foot (1,447.8 meters) mountain ascent to the finish line. Westergaard is walking at a snail's pace and says he\u2019s falling asleep. But his smile hasn\u2019t waned.",
      "\u201cWe've come a long way,\u201d Westergaard said, Madison pacing behind and spraying him.",
      "\u201cLong way for a burger!\u201d she responded. They giggle while thinking about the veggie burger they'll buy upon finishing.",
      "Then he does, crossing the finish line with his crew at exactly 45 hours and 29 minutes.",
      "It was his most special Badwater 135 race by far, he says misty eyed, having Meagan and Madison at his side.",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says export controls on advanced chips require companies to adapt",
      "BEIJING -- The head of Nvidia downplayed his role in getting the U.S. government to lift a ban on selling an advanced computer chip in China and said it will take time to ramp up production once orders for the AI-processor come in.",
      "CEO Jensen Huang, speaking Wednesday in the Chinese capital Beijing, was upbeat about the prospects for the H20 chip, which was designed to meet U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China but nonetheless blocked in April.",
      "He met U.S. President Donald Trump before his trip and his company announced this week it had received assurances that sales to China would be approved.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I changed his mind,\u201d Huang told a cluster of journalists, many of whom asked for his autograph or to take selfies with him.",
      "A carefully organized press conference at a luxury hotel descended into a crowd scene when Huang arrived in his trademark leather jacket and started taking questions randomly in his characteristic casual style.",
      "Export controls and tariffs were something companies must adapt to in a world he said was reconfiguring itself. He described his role as informing governments in the U.S. and elsewhere of the nature and unintended consequences of their policies.",
      "The decision to lift the ban on the H20 chip was entirely in the hands of the American and Chinese governments and whatever trade talks they had, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can only influence them, inform them, do our best to provide them with facts,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd then beyond that is out of our control.\u201d",
      "Nvidia said in April that sales restrictions on its chip in China on national security grounds would cost the company $5.5 billion. The White House also blocked a chip from Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies say the Commerce Department is now moving forward with license applications to export them to China.",
      "Huang said his company would likely be able to recover some of its losses but it's unclear how much. That will depend on how many H20 orders are received and how quickly Nvidia can meet the demand.",
      "\u201cI think that H20 is going to be very successful here,\u201d he said, noting the chip's memory bandwidth makes it a good fit for the AI models being developed by Chinese companies such as DeepSeek and Alibaba.",
      "Huang also touted the release of a new RTX Pro graphics chip that he said would power the development of humanoid robots. He described robotic systems with teams of robots working alongside people as the next wave in AI.",
      "\u201cBecause there\u2019s so much robotics innovation going on and so much smart factory work being done here and the supply chain is so vast, RTX Pro is perfect,\u201d he said.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming in the gas around a baby sun-like star, providing a precious peek into the dawn of our own solar system.",
      "It\u2019s an unprecedented snapshot of \u201ctime zero,\u201d scientists reported Wednesday, when new worlds begin to gel.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve captured a direct glimpse of the hot region where rocky planets like Earth are born around young protostars,\" said Leiden Observatory\u2019s Melissa McClure from the Netherlands, who led the international research team. \u201cFor the first time, we can conclusively say that the first steps of planet formation are happening right now.\u201d",
      "The observations offer a unique glimpse into the inner workings of an emerging planetary system, said the University of Chicago\u2019s Fred Ciesla, who was not involved in the study appearing in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the things we\u2019ve been waiting for. Astronomers have been thinking about how planetary systems form for a long period of time,\" Ciesla said. \u201cThere's a rich opportunity here.\u201d",
      "NASA\u2019s Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory in Chile teamed up to unveil these early nuggets of planetary formation around the young star known as HOPS-315. It\u2019s a yellow dwarf in the making like the sun, yet much younger at 100,000 to 200,000 years old and some 1,370 light-years away. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "In a cosmic first, McClure and her team stared deep into the gas disk around the baby star and detected solid specks condensing \u2014 signs of early planet formation. A gap in the outer part of the disk gave allowed them to gaze inside, thanks to the way the star tilts toward Earth.",
      "They detected silicon monoxide gas as well as crystalline silicate minerals, the ingredients for what\u2019s believed to be the first solid materials to form in our solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago. The action is unfolding in a location comparable to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter containing the leftover building blocks of our solar system\u2019s planets.",
      "The condensing of hot minerals was never detected before around other young stars, \u201cso we didn\u2019t know if it was a universal feature of planet formation or a weird feature of our solar system,\u201d McClure said in an email. \u201cOur study shows that it could be a common process during the earliest stage of planet formation.\u201d",
      "While other research has looked at younger gas disks and, more commonly, mature disks with potential planet wannabes, there\u2019s been no specific evidence for the start of planet formation until now, McClure said.",
      "In a stunning picture taken by the ESO's Alma telescope network, the emerging planetary system resembles a lightning bug glowing against the black void.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many planets might form around HOPS-315. With a gas disk as massive as the sun\u2019s might have been, it could also wind up with eight planets a million or more years from now, according to McClure.",
      "Purdue University\u2019s Merel van \u2019t Hoff, a co-author, is eager to find more budding planetary systems. By casting a wider net, astronomers can look for similarities and determine which processes might be crucial to forming Earth-like worlds.",

      "Cleaning your electronic devices is essential for hygiene and performance",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones, laptops, headphones and other electronic devices are essential for work and play in our daily lives. But all that time spent typing, scrolling or listening also means our devices gradually accumulate grime that needs to be cleaned off.",
      "You might not give much thought to cleaning your devices but there are reasons you should, says Logitech, which makes keyboards, webcams and other computer peripherals.",
      "\u201cRegular cleaning and proper maintenance not only keeps your gadgets looking pristine, and wins you hygiene points, it also helps them perform better and last longer,\u201d the company says. \u201cIn the case of devices like earbuds, the accumulated bacteria and debris may even cause health issues or discomfort.\u201d",
      "Here are some pointers on cleaning your tech:",
      "Always check if the manufacturer has any specific guidelines for cleaning.",
      "Assemble some basic equipment and material for cleaning, which should include a soft and lint-free cleaning cloth, like a microfiber cloth; cotton swabs; a soft-bristled brush like a toothbrush, paintbrush or makeup brush; compressed air and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, is a non-toxic cleaning solvent that\u2019s antiseptic and antibacterial. It's popular for cleaning electronics because it doesn\u2019t leave any residue and dries quickly. But you might want to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation. Drip some of it on a cloth instead of pouring it directly onto your device. Also heed some of the more specific warnings below.",
      "Water and mild soap can be useful for cleaning dirty surfaces, but isopropyl alcohol is recommended for cleaning the internals of a device, said Alex Diaz-Kokaisl, senior technical writer at electronics repair company iFixit.",
      "\u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule for cleaning electronics, we generally use high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because it evaporates quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster a liquid evaporates, the less likely it is to affect any components that conduct electricity.\u201d",
      "For whatever device you're cleaning, disconnect or power it off first. Remove any cases, plugs, covers and accessories.",

      "At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a half-dozen workers are making what appear to be gray billiard balls",
      "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. -- Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today\u2019s power plants use.",
      "The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production.",
      "President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030.",
      "But just like cars won\u2019t run without gas, those plants won\u2019t run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump.",
      "In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique time,\u201d said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy\u2019s subsidiary TRISO-X. \u201cThe momentum is incredible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity.",
      "X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel \u2014 inside what's known as \u201cpebbles.\u201d Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor.",
      "At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade.",
      "Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up \u2014 one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said.",
      "At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings \u2014 like candy dipping \u2014 that make them look like very tiny BBs.",
      "X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it\u2019s strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV.",
      "The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs.",
      "The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said.",
      "Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they\u2019re too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources.",
      "\u201cWithout a substantial decrease in construction costs, it\u2019s not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst.",
      "Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.",
      "Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "There\u2019s little of it made in the United States right now.",
      "Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation\u2019s first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors.",
      "A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to \u201camp up\u201d domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department.",
      "At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity \u2014 if the right actions are taken now.",
      "X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell said he hopes to help solve the fuel problem so it doesn\u2019t hold back new reactor development. The Energy Department has awarded funding to X-energy. Amazon invested in X-energy too, and they\u2019re collaborating to bring more than 5 gigawatts of new U.S. power projects online by 2039.",
      "X-energy is the only one with an application before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license a new fabrication facility to transform enriched uranium into fuel products for nuclear reactors. Another applicant has asked to amend an existing license to make fuel for advanced reactors, according to the NRC. About five additional companies have told the NRC they are interested in making fuel for advanced reactors.",
      "X-energy's pilot lab at the National Laboratory started in 2016. The company now has 100 acres in Oak Ridge and growing for its nuclear fuel production complex.",
      "The first factory could be operational by late 2027 or early 2028, capable at full operation of assembling enough fuel orbs to power 11 of its new-age reactors; a second by late 2029, with a capacity four times greater, said TRISO-X President Joel Duling.",
      "\u201cI've been through two or three \u2018nuclear renaissances,\u2019\" Duling said. \u201cThis isn't a renaissance. This is a game-changer.\u201d",

      "Jacobs used an underwater microphone to confirm that the \u201csponging\u201d dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, were still using echolocation clicks to guide them. Then she modeled the extent of the sound wave distortion from the sponges.",
      "For those wild dolphins that have mastered foraging with nose sponges, scientists say it's a very efficient way to catch fish. The wild marine sponges vary from the size of a softball to a cantaloupe.",

      "Asked whether he was happy there was no robot umpire then, Torre grinned and said: \u201cPossibly.\u201d",
      "Then he added without a prompt: \u201cWell, not to mention the home run that Jeter hit.\"",
      "His reference was to Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 AL Championship Series opener, when 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to snatch the ball above the glove over Baltimore right fielder Tony Tarasco.",

    "story": [
      "A study puts the spotlight on Texas as the leading U.S. state by far for flood-related deaths, with more than 1,000 of them from 1959 to 2019",
      "Even before the Central Texas floods that killed more than 100 people, the state was by far the leader in U.S. flood deaths due partly to geography that can funnel rainwater into deadly deluges, according to a study spanning decades.",
      "From 1959 to 2019, 1,069 people died in Texas in flooding, which is nearly one-fifth of the total 5,724 flood fatalities in the Lower 48 states in that time, according to a 2021 study in the journal Water. That's about 370 more than the next closest state, Louisiana.",
      "Flooding is the second leading weather cause of death in the country, after heat, both in 2024 and the last 30 years, averaging 145 deaths a year in the last decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Other floods have turned deadly this year: Last month in San Antonio, 13 people died including 11 people who drove into water thinking they could get through, according to study author Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio who studies why people die in floods.",
      "For several years Sharif has urged state and local officials to integrate better emergency action programs to use flood forecasts and save lives by alerting people and closing off vulnerable intersections where roads and water meet.",
      "\u201cI think in Kerr County, if they had an integrated warning system that uses rainfall forecasts to forecast real-time impacts on the ground, that could have saved many lives and could have also helped emergency crews to know which location would be flooded, which roads would be impassable,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey could have taken action.\u201d",
      "Texas has so many deaths because of its geography, population and size, experts say. The area where the most recent deadly floods struck is known as flash flood alley because of hills and valleys.",
      "\u201cSteep, hilly terrain produces rapid runoff and quick stream rises, since the water will travel downhill at greater speed into rivers and over land,\u201d said Kate Abshire, lead of NOAA\u2019s flash flood services. \u201cRocky terrain can exacerbate the development of flash floods and raging waters, since rocks and clay soils do not allow as much water to infiltrate the ground.\u201d",
      "\u201cUrban areas are especially prone to flash floods due to the large amounts of concrete and asphalt surfaces that do not allow water to penetrate into the soil easily,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with those hills, \u201cyou\u2019ve got the Gulf of Mexico right there, the largest body of hot water in the entire North Atlantic most of the time,\u201d said Jeff Masters a former government meteorologist who co-founded Weather Underground and now is at Yale Climate Connections. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got a ready source of moisture for creating floods.\u201d",
      "Historically, many of the deaths were preventable across the nation and in Texas alike, according to experts. Masters said nothing illustrates that better than one statistic in Sharif's study: 86% of flood deaths since 1959 were people driving or walking into floodwaters.",
      "Nearly 58% of the deaths were people in cars and trucks. It's a problem especially in Texas because of hills and low lying areas that have more than 3,000 places where roads cross streams and waterways without bridges or culverts, Sharif said.",
      "\u201cPeople in Texas, they like trucks and SUVs, especially trucks,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey think trucks are tough, and that is I think a factor. So sometimes they use their big car or SUV or truck, and they say they can beat the flood on the street ... especially at night. They underestimate the depth and velocity of water.\u201d",
      "Abshire said that not only do people ignore the weather service's safety mantra, \u201cTurn around, don\u2019t drown,\u201d but studies found that a number of these fatalities occur when people actively drive around barricades and barriers blocking flooded roads.",
      "The latest Texas Hill Country flooding was less typical because so many of the deaths were in a camp where the water overtook the victims, not people going into the water, Sharif said. Only about 8% of flood deaths in the last 60 years happened in permanent homes, mobile homes or camping, according to the study.",
      "The July 4th floods happened at night, a common time for flood deaths. More than half of deaths since 1959 have occurred at night, when it's dark and people can't see how much flooding there is or are not awake for the warnings, Sharif's study found.",
      "As far as demographics, about 62% of U.S. flood deaths were male, according to the study.",
      "\u201cRisk-taking behavior is usually associated with men,\u201d Sharif said, adding that it's why most fatal victims of car crashes are male.",

      "Bondi, in response, said action could come in court as soon as Friday. But the release of any grand jury materials could take longer, subject to a legal process to consider impact on victims and ultimately approval of a federal judge.",
      "According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Trump allegedly sent Epstein a letter in 2003 for his 50th birthday. The president is now threatening to sue the paper, and in an interview with the Journal, denied writing the letter. ABC News has not been able to confirm the existence of the letter.",
      "\"I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his 'pile of garbage' newspaper, the WSJ. That will be an interesting experience!!!\" the president wrote on his social media platform Friday.",
      "The move from Trump to order the attorney general to seek the release of additional grand jury material comes after a week of intense pressure from his MAGA supporters to do more on Epstein following a brief memo from the Justice Department and FBI stating no further disclosure \"would be appropriate or warranted.\"",
      "The memo stated a review from the DOJ and FBI found no evidence that Epstein kept a so-called \"client list\" of associates or that he blackmailed any prominent individuals, and also confirmed the disgraced financier died by suicide in prison while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.",
      "Bondi days ago had said the \"memo speaks for itself.\"",
      "Between then and now, Trump has tried to tamp down intrigue into Epstein that's been fueled by right-wing figures for years, including conspiracy theories of a \"deep state\" protecting the country's elites.",
      "He has called the Epstein files a \"Democratic hoax\" against him and those Republican supporters who are questioning his administration's handling of them as \"stupid\" and \"foolish.\"",
      "But his administration has shut down the idea of appointing a special prosecutor in the Epstein case.",
      "\"The idea was floated from someone in the media to the president. The president would not recommend a special prosecutor in the Epstein case. That's how he feels,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at Thursday's briefing.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Anyone firing up the grill this summer already knows hamburger patties and steaks are expensive, but the latest numbers show prices have climbed to record highs.",
      "And experts say consumers shouldn't expect much relief soon either.",
      "The average price of a pound of ground beef rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",
      "But this is not a recent phenomenon. Beef prices have been steadily rising over the past 20 years because the supply of cattle remains tight while beef remains popular.",
      "In fact, the U.S. cattle herd has been steadily shrinking for decades. As of Jan. 1, the U.S. had 86.7 million cattle and calves, down 8% from the most recent peak in 2019. That is the lowest number of cattle since 1951, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Many factors including drought and cattle prices have contributed to that decline. And now the emergence of a pesky parasite in Mexico and the prospect of widespread tariffs may further reduce supply and raise prices.",
      "Here's a look at what's causing the price of beef to rise.",
      "The American beef industry has gotten better at breeding larger animals, so ranchers can provide the same amount of beef with fewer cattle, said David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&M.",
      "Then in 2020, a three-year drought began that dried out pastures and raised the cost of feed for cattle, according to the American Farm Bureau. Drought has continued to be a problem across the West since then, and the price of feed has put more pressure on ranchers who already operate on slim profit margins.",
      "In response, many farmers slaughtered more female cattle than usual, which helped beef supplies in the short term but lowered the size of future herds. Lower cattle supplies has raised prices.",
      "In recent years cattle prices have soared, so that now animals are selling for thousands of dollars apiece. Recent prices show cattle selling for more than $230 per hundredweight, or hundred pounds.",
      "Those higher prices give ranchers more incentive to sell cows now to capture profits instead of hanging onto them for breeding given that prices in the years ahead may decrease, Anderson said.",
      "\u201cFor them, the balance is, \u2018Do I sell that animal now and take this record high check?\u2019 Or \u2018do I keep her to realize her returns over her productive life when she\u2019s having calves?\u2019\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s this balancing act and so far the side that\u2019s been winning is to sell her and get the check.\u201d",
      "The emergence of a flesh-eating pest in cattle herds in Mexico has put extra pressure on supply because officials cut off all imports of cattle from south of the border last year. Some 4% of the cattle the U.S. feeds to slaughter for beef comes from Mexico.",
      "The pest is the New World screwworm fly, and female flies lay eggs in wounds on warm-blooded animals. The larvae that hatch are unusual among flies for feeding on live flesh and fluids instead of dead material. American officials worry that if the fly reaches Texas, its flesh-eating maggots could cause large economic losses as they did decades ago before the U.S. eradicated the pest.",
      "Agricultural economist Bernt Nelson with the Farm Bureau said the loss of that many cattle is putting additional pressure on supply that is helping drive prices higher.",
      "President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to have a major impact on beef prices but they could be another factor that drives prices higher because the U.S. imports more than 4 million pounds of beef every year.",
      "Much of what is imported is lean beef trimmings that meatpackers mix with fattier beef produced in the U.S. to produce the varieties of ground beef that domestic consumers want. Much of that lean beef comes from Australia and New Zealand that have only seen a 10% tariff, but some of it comes from Brazil where Trump has threatened tariffs as high as 50%.",
      "If the tariffs remain in place long-term, meat processors will have to pay higher prices on imported lean beef. It wouldn't be easy for U.S. producers to replace because the country's system is geared toward producing fattier beef known for marbled steaks.",
      "It's the height of grilling season and demand in the U.S. for beef remains strong, which Kansas State agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said will help keep prices higher.",
      "If prices remain this high, shoppers will likely start to buy more hamburger meat and fewer steaks, but that doesn't appear to be happening broadly yet \u2014 and people also don't seem to be buying chicken or pork instead of beef.",
      "Nelson said that recently the drought has eased \u2014 allowing pasture conditions to improve \u2014 and grain prices are down thanks to the drop in export demand for corn because of the tariffs. Those factors, combined with the high cattle prices might persuade more ranchers to keep their cows and breed them to expand the size of their herds.",
      "Even if ranchers decided to raise more cattle to help replace those imports, it would take at least two years to breed and raise them. And it wouldn't be clear if that is happening until later this fall when ranchers typically make those decisions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve still got a lot of barriers in the way to grow this herd,\u201d Nelson said. Just consider that a young farmer who wants to add 25 bred heifers to his herd has to be prepared to spend more than $100,000 at auction at a time when borrowing costs remain high.",
      "There is typically a seasonal decline in beef prices as grilling season slows down into the fall, but those price declines are likely to be modest.",

      "A Wisconsin judge has approved the conditional release of Morgan Geyser, who as a child nearly stabbed a classmate to death to please the fictional horror character Slender Man",
      "A judge has approved a conditional release plan for a Wisconsin woman who nearly killed her classmate years ago to please the fictional horror character Slender Man.",
      "Waukesha County Circuit Judge Scott Wagner signed off Thursday on the plan to release Morgan Geyser, now 22, from the Winnebago Mental Health Institute, a psychiatric hospital where she has spent the last seven years.",
      "In April, prosecutors objected to Geyser\u2019s original conditional release plan after the mother of the victim, Payton Leutner, expressed concern that Geyser\u2019s group home was located eight miles away from Leutner. The judge then ordered the Department of Health Services to draft a new plan, which was approved Thursday. Details of the plan were not shared in court.",
      "Geyser and her friend, Anissa Weier, lured Leutner to a Waukesha park after a sleepover in 2014. Geyser stabbed Leutner 19 times while Weier egged her on. All three girls were 12 years old at the time.",
      "Geyser and Weier fled after the attack but were arrested as they were walking on Interstate 94. They told investigators they attacked Leutner to earn the right to be Slender Man\u2019s servants and feared he would hurt their families if they didn\u2019t follow through. They had planned to walk to Slender Man\u2019s mansion in northern Wisconsin after the attack, they said.",
      "Leutner barely survived the attack. Geyser ultimately pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in 2017 but claimed she wasn\u2019t responsible because she was mentally ill. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren committed her to a psychiatric hospital for 40 years in 2018, but the judge ruled in January she could be released after three experts testified she has made progress battling mental illness.",
      "State health officials argued in March that Geyser couldn\u2019t be trusted after learning that she hadn\u2019t told her therapists that she had read a novel about murder and black market organ sales. They also alleged that she had been communicating with a man who collects murder memorabilia and sent him her own sketch of a decapitated body and a postcard saying she wants to be intimate with him.",
      "Cotton countered that Geyser only read what the facility allowed, and staff knew she had been communicating with the collector. He added that she stopped talking to the man in 2024 after she discovered he was selling things she sent him. Bohren concluded that Geyser wasn\u2019t trying to hide anything and ordered state health officials to continue developing a release plan.",
      "Wagner took over Geyser\u2019s release request after Bohren retired this past April.",
      "Weier pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree intentional homicide with a dangerous weapon in 2017, but like Geyser claimed she was mentally ill and not responsible for her actions. She was committed to 25 years in a mental hospital but was granted release in 2021 after agreeing to live with her father and to wear a GPS monitor.",
      "The case has drawn widespread attention in part because of the girls\u2019 fascination with the Slender Man character. Slender Man was created online by Eric Knudson in 2009 as a mysterious specter photo-edited into everyday images of children at play. He\u2019s typically depicted as a slim, spidery figure in a black suit with a featureless white face. He has grown into a popular boogeyman and has appeared in video games, online stories and a 2018 movie.",

      "McALLEN, Texas -- In 2006, top U.S. Border Patrol officials were asked how long it would take to hire 6,000 agents, a roughly 50% increase at the time. Michael Fisher, then deputy chief in San Diego, says the officials concluded they would need five years.",
      "\u201cYou have 2 1/2 years,\u201d Fisher recalls being told.",
      "With Immigration and Customs Enforcement now preparing to add 10,000 employees within five years to assist with President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts, the Border Patrol\u2019s torrid expansion in the early 2000s serves as a cautionary tale. Hiring and training standards were changed and arrests for employee misconduct rose. Pressure to turbo-charge growth can also lead to attrition.",
      "\"If they don\u2019t uphold pretty rigorous standards and background checks, you can end up hiring the wrong people, and then you pay a huge price in how the public perceives them,\u201d said Gil Kerlikowske, who was commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol's parent agency, from 2014 to 2017.",
      "ICE, the main agency responsible for arresting and deporting people within the U.S., is set to get $76.5 billion, nearly 10 times its annual budget, under a bill Trump signed on July 4. Most of that money is for detention, but some is for hiring and other uses. The White House says ICE will grow from 20,000 employees to about 30,000.",
      "\u201cTo do it today is an effort that needs to start years ago,\u201d said Matthew Hudak, former Border Patrol deputy chief. \u201cThe funding is there, but it is nearly impossible to bring in that many people that quickly because you hit challenges.\"",
      "The Border Patrol nearly doubled its workforce from 11,264 agents in October 2005 to 21,444 agents six years later.",
      "To recruit officers, the agency sponsored a NASCAR race car and bull riding contests. It aired ads during Dallas Cowboys football games. It advertised at military bases. Billboards and job fairs hundreds of miles from the border promised fulfilling careers, resulting in thousands of applications a week.",
      "The agency also loosened some hiring guidelines and training requirements. The age limit for new hires was raised to 40 years old from 37. Spanish language training was cut by up to 30 days, some training was moved online and other instruction was shifted to the field to lessen time at a training academy that the agency opened in Artesia, New Mexico, during the hiring surge, according to a Government Accountability Office report.",
      "Arrests for illegal crossings fell to their lowest levels in decades \u2014 a sign for some that the strategy succeeded.",
      "But other measurements were more troubling.",
      "In 2008, the Border Patrol struggled to keep new agents, with about 20% failing to graduate from the academy and more leaving after returning to their stations.",
      "Arrests of CBP employees for misconduct increased to 336 in the 2012 fiscal year from 190 seven years earlier. The agency saw a spate of high-profile corruption cases, including agents accused of smuggling people across the border or working with drug cartels to bring illegal drugs into the U.S.",
      "The polygraph pass rate for new applicants tumbled to 33% in 2012 from 58% four years earlier. While the accuracy of the tests came under scrutiny, one applicant admitted that his brother-in-law, a known Mexican drug smuggler, asked him to use his employment to facilitate cocaine trafficking. Another admitted to using marijuana 9,000 times, including the night before the exam.",
      "A 2015 Homeland Security report found that the number of investigators assigned to internal wrongdoing was \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d for the agency\u2019s growth.",
      "\"Any time you have massive political pressure to beef up overnight, it never turns out well,\" said T.J. Bonner, the former president of the Border Patrol agents union who retired in 2011. \"Too many corners have to be cut. Then when things go wrong. the fingers get pointed.\u201d",
      "ICE and Homeland Security did not respond to questions about lessons that the Border Patrol's hiring spree or detailed plans for hiring at ICE.",
      "\u201cThe unprecedented funding for ICE will enable my hard-working officers and agents to continue making America safe again by identifying, arresting and removing criminal aliens from our communities,\u201d Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, said after Trump signed the bill.",
      "Critics say the administration\u2019s policy to target anyone in the country illegally, not just those with criminal records, could lead to abuses. Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff and lead architect of his immigration policies, had set an aggressive target of at least 3,000 arrests a day even before any additional hiring.",
      "\u201cWhen there are no priorities, everybody\u2019s a priority,\u201d said Nayna Gupta, policy director of the American Immigration Council. \u201cYou\u2019re very likely to see confusion, delay, wrongful arrest, more mistakes when law enforcement agencies, especially large ones, don\u2019t have clear direction and guidance for prioritization.\u201d",
      "Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said competition for qualified law enforcement is tough, with departments now offering signing bonuses of $10,000 to $100,000.",
      "Border Patrol staffing has yet to return to its peaks of the early 2010s. Trump tried to increase staffing in his first term. A contract with consulting firm Accenture PLC cost $13.6 million to set up in 2018 and resulted in only two hires over 10 months.",
      "Trump's bill allocates about $170 billion for border and immigration enforcement, with $4.1 billion for CBP hiring that includes 3,000 more Border Patrol agents. It comes at a time of historically low crossings after they reached a record high in December 2023.",

      "Trying to help a family of five, Childers paid \u201cthe highest sacrifice with his life in front of his three children and wife,\u201d according to the fundraiser. Childers died Sunday, the police department for Pawleys Island, which is south of Myrtle Beach, stated in a post on X.",

      "A rip current is a fast-moving column of water that flows away from the shore toward open water. Officials say swimmers caught in one should remain calm and then swim parallel to the shore to escape the current.",

It comes as 319 million people around the world are facing acute hunger, and people in places like Gaza, Sudan, South Sudan, Mali and Haiti are teetering on the brink of starvation, according to the U.N. World Food Program.",
      "Bruce said the amount destroyed was less than 1% of the 1 million metric tons of food assistance that the United States supplies each year and suggested that the destroyed stockpile would be replaced. But she could not say if the Trump administration would continue to provide the 1 million metric tons going forward.",
      "\u201cIf something is expired, we will destroy it,\u201d Bruce said, brushing aside appeals for the administration to either distribute the assistance itself or give it to aid agencies who could do so. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of whether or not it\u2019s safe to distribute.\u201d",
      "Bruce said destroying expired stockpiled food \u2014 which is generally stored in warehouses near regions or countries at risk for drought, famine and other disasters \u2014 are not unprecedented and have occurred under previous administrations that have not pursued draconian cuts in foreign assistance.",

      "\u201cIt took two officers to nail my back and then one on my neck to arrest me even though my hands were already behind my back,\u201d Retes said.",
      "The Ventura City native was detained during chaotic raids at two Southern California farms where federal authorities arrested more than 360 people, one of the largest operations since President Donald Trump took office in January. Protesters faced off against federal agents in military-style gear, and one farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse roof.",
      "The raids came more than a month into an extended immigration crackdown by the Trump administration across Southern California that was originally centered in Los Angeles, where local officials say the federal actions are spreading fear in immigrant communities.",

      "Retes was taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, where he said he was put in a special cell on suicide watch and checked on each day after he became emotionally distraught over his ordeal and missing his 3-year-old daughter's birthday party Saturday.",
      "He said federal agents never told him why he was arrested or allowed him to contact a lawyer or his family during his three-day detention. Authorities never let him shower or change clothes despite being covered in tear gas and pepper spray, Retes said, adding that his hands burned throughout the first night he spent in custody.",
      "On Sunday, an officer had him sign a paper and walked him out of the detention center. He said he was told he faced no charges.",
      "\u201cThey gave me nothing I could wrap my head around,\" Retes said, explaining that he was met with silence on his way out when he asked about being \"locked up for three days with no reason and no charges.\u201d",

That's roughly half the number the administration sent to the city following protests over the immigration actions. Some of those troops have been accompanying federal agents during their immigration enforcement operations.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults say that President Donald Trump's policies have helped them since he took office, according to a new poll that finds underwhelming marks for him on key issues, including the economy, immigration, government spending and health care.",
      "In fact, the Republican president fails to earn majority approval on any of the issues included in the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. He's even slipped slightly since earlier this year on immigration, which has consistently been a strength for him in his second term.",
      "And while a majority of Americans do see Trump as at least \u201csomewhat\u201d capable of getting things done following the passage of his sprawling budget bill, fewer believe he understands the problems facing people like them.",
      "Roughly half of U.S. adults report that Trump\u2019s policies have \u201cdone more to hurt\u201d them since his second term began six months ago, the survey found. About 2 in 10 say his policies have \u201cnot made a difference\u201d in their lives, with about one-quarter saying his policies have \"done more to help\u201d them.",
      "The vast majority of Democrats and about half of independents say Trump\u2019s policies have had a negative impact, while even many Republicans say they haven't seen positive effects.",
      "\u201cAs it sits today, I don\u2019t know his policies have made much of a difference in my day-to-day life,\u201d said Landon Lindemer, a 29-year-old logistics manager from suburban Atlanta who voted for Trump three times.",
      "Lindemer said he generally approves of Trump's job performance, even if he has concerns about the massive spending in the big bill the president signed into law on July 4.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sold it\u2019s really going to help,\" he said.",
      "The mixed reviews on Trump's policies come as he struggles to follow through on key campaign promises, including lowering costs for working-class Americans, preserving popular social welfare programs like Medicaid, ending foreign wars and lowering government spending.",
      "Inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs push up the cost of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances. Separately, Trump\u2019s budget bill included Medicaid cuts that will lead to 11.8 million more Americans becoming uninsured and add $3.3 trillion to the national debt, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.",
      "At the same time, violent conflicts still rage in Israel and Ukraine.",
      "Overall, the new poll finds that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump's job performance, a figure that's in line with his June approval but historically weak compared with recent presidents. Closer to half of U.S. adults approved of President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama at roughly the same point in their Democratic presidencies, according to polls from AP-NORC and Gallup, although Biden's approval rating declined in the second half of his first year and remained low for the rest of his time in office.",
      "Poll respondent Bailey Neill, a 42-year-old attorney from San Antonio, said he was \u201cterrified\u201d of Trump.",
      "Neill, a Democrat who describes himself as a \u201cstudent of history,\u201d cast Trump as an authoritarian who has followed the controversial playbook outlined in Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for transformative changes across the federal government that Trump tried to distance himself from before the November election.",
      "\u201cIn terms of my day-to-day life, I really haven\u2019t seen a change, except for the general fear and anxiety I feel at a core level,\u201d Neill said.",
      "Trump earned less than 50% approval on every issue included in the new AP-NORC poll, including the economy, government spending, trade, taxes, immigration, health care and his handling of the conflict in the Middle East.",
      "Only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.",
      "Trump also appears to have lost some support for his spending decisions. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of Trump's handling of government spending, down from 46% in March.",
      "On the economy overall, roughly 4 in 10 adults approve of Trump's performance, which hasn't changed measurably in the last few months.",
      "Timothy Dwyer, of Dyersburg, Tennessee, a 26-year-old self-described independent who works in retail sales and leans Republican, said Trump's work on the economy, especially his tariffs, has \u201creally sucked.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A spokesman for Camp Mystic, the Texas enclave devastated by a July 4 flash flood, is raising concerns about communication failures during the disaster",
      "The leader of Camp Mystic had been tracking the weather before the deadly Texas floods, but it is now unclear whether he saw an urgent warning from the National Weather Service that had triggered an emergency alert to phones in the area, a spokesman for camp\u2019s operators said Wednesday.",
      "Richard \u201cDick\u201d Eastland, the owner of Camp Mystic, began taking action after more than 2 inches of rain had fallen in the area along the Guadalupe River, said Jeff Carr, a spokesman for the family and the camp. He said Eastland had a \u201chome weather station\u201d and was monitoring the rain on July 4.",
      "But after initially portraying to the media this week that Eastland got the weather alerts about a flash flood, Carr told The Associated Press that critical moment in the timeline of the tragedy isn\u2019t as clear as the family and staff first thought. No one in the family or camp staff, Carr said, could now say whether Eastland got the alert at 1:14 a.m.",
      "\u201cIt was assumed that just because he had a cellphone on and shortly after that alert, he was calling his family on the walkie-talkies saying, \u2018Hey, we got two inches in the last hour. We need to get the canoes up. We got things to do,' \u201d Carr said.",
      "The new account by the family comes as Camp Mystic staff has come under scrutiny of their actions, what preventive measures were taken and the camp's emergency plan leading up to a during the catastrophic flood that has killed at least 132 people.",
      "The flash-flood warning that the National Weather Service issued at 1:14 a.m. on July 4 for Kerr County triggered an emergency alerts to broadcast outlets, weather radios and mobile phones. It warned of \u201ca dangerous and life-threatening situation.\u201d The weather service extended the warning at 3:35 a.m. and escalated it to flash-flood emergency at 4:03 a.m.",
      "Eastland died while trying to rescue girls and was found in his Tahoe that was swept away by the floodwaters, Carr said.",
      "Even without a storm, the cellphone coverage at Camp Mystic is spotty at best, so campers and staff turn on their Wi-Fi, Carr said. He called ridiculous criticism that Eastland waited too long before beginning to evacuate the campers, which he said appears to have begun sometime between 2 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.",
      "\u201cCommunication was a huge deficiency,\u201d Carr said. \"This community was hamstrung, nobody could communicate. The first responder, the first rescue personnel that showed up was a game warden.\u201d",
      "According to Carr, Eastland and others started evacuating girls from cabins nearest the overflowing river and moved them to the camp's two-story recreation hall. Of the 10 cabins closest to the river, the recreation hall is the furthest at 865 feet (264 meters) with the closest cabin about 315 feet (96 meters), according to an Associated Press analysis of aerial imagery.",
      "To reach Senior Hill, which was on higher ground , they would have had to cross an overflowing creek, Carr said. At times the young campers were climbing hills in bare feet, he said.",
      "Some of the camp\u2019s buildings \u2014 which flooded \u2014 were in what the Federal Emergency Management Agency considered a 100-year flood plain. But in response to an appeal, FEMA in 2013 amended the county\u2019s flood map to remove 15 of the camp\u2019s buildings from the hazard area. Carr said there were \u201clegitimate\u201d reasons for filing appeals and suggested that the maps may not always be accurate.",
      "Just before daybreak on the Fourth of July, destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe River, washing away homes and vehicles. Crews in helicopters, boats and drones have been searching for victims.",
      "Officials say 97 people in the Kerrville area may still be missing.",

      "President Donald Trump will not recommend a special counsel in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump will not recommend a special counsel in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, a White House spokeswoman said Thursday, turning aside calls for further action in an inquiry that has roiled the Justice Department and angered supporters who had been expecting a treasure trove of documents from the case.",
      "The rejection of a special counsel is part of an effort by the White House to turn the page from continued outrage from corners of Trump's base over the Justice Department's refusal last week to release additional records from the investigation into Epstein, a well-connected and wealthy financier who killed himself in jail in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",
      "Officials also said Epstein did not maintain a much-hyped \u201cclient list\u201d and said the evidence was clear he had died by suicide despite conspiracy theories to the contrary.",
      "Trump on Wednesday sought to clamp down on criticism from his own supporters about his administration's handling of the Epstein-related records, calling them \u201cweaklings\" who were being duped and characterizing the investigation as a \u201choax\" \u2014 even though his hand-picked leaders at the FBI and Justice Department had long stoked public expectations that important information was being hidden.",
      "The news organization Just the News published excerpts Wednesday from a Trump interview in which Trump said he would be open to having a special counsel look into \u201canything credible\u201d related to Epstein, as well as other long-standing grievances he and his supporters have long raised.",
      "But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to close the door Thursday on a special counsel for the Epstein investigation, saying \"the idea was floated from someone in the media to the president.\u201d",
      "\"The president would not recommend a special prosecutor in the Epstein case,\u201d she said.",
      "Justice Department regulations allow for the attorney general to appoint and supervise an outside special counsel to investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing in instances when prosecutors might face a potential or perceived conflict of interest.",
      "The department in recent years has appointed a succession of special counsels \u2014 sometimes, though not always, plucked from outside the agency \u2014 to lead investigations into politically sensitive matters, including into conduct by President Joe Biden and by Trump.",
      "Last year, Trump\u2019s personal lawyers launched an aggressive, and successful, challenge to the appointment of Jack Smith, the special counsel assigned to investigate his efforts to undo the 2020 presidential election and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "A Trump-appointed judge agreed, ruling that then-Attorney General Merrick Garland had exceeded his bounds by appointing a prosecutor without Senate approval and confirmation, and dismissed the case.",
      "That legal team included Todd Blanche, who is now deputy attorney general, as well as Emil Bove, who is Blanche\u2019s top deputy but was recently nominated to serve as a judge on a federal appeals court.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations chief said Thursday that he would have liked more results from his meetings with the rival leaders of divided Cyprus, while the Turkish Cypriot leader said he was \u201cvery, very upset\u201d that there was no agreement on opening four new border crossings.",
      "Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the meetings \u201cconstructive\u201d and pointed to progress on four of the six initiatives that the leaders agreed to in March. He cautioned, however, that \u201cthere\u2019s a long road ahead.\u201d",
      "The Mediterranean island was divided in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup by Athens junta-backed supporters of uniting the island with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence, and it maintains more than 35,000 troops in the island\u2019s northern third.",
      "Negotiations between the rivals have been stalled since 2017. When asked whether he would start a new round, Guterres responded that there is more to be done before any negotiations. The current talks are \u201ccomplex,\u201d he said, stressing the very different views of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots on a solution.",
      "\u201cI think we are building, step by step, confidence and creating the conditions to do concrete things to the benefit of the Cypriot people,\u201d the secretary-general said.",
      "The agreed-upon, U.N.-endorsed framework for a peace deal has been a reunified Cyprus as a federation composed of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot zones.",
      "Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar has been demanding a two-state deal ever since his 2020 election. He faces reelection in October and says he\u2019s running on the same two-state platform with Ankara\u2019s full backing.",
      "Tatar told reporters after the meeting that \u201cunless our sovereign equality and equal international status is reaffirmed, we will not resume formal negotiations for the resolution of the Cyprus problem.\u201d",
      "Greek Cypriots reject any agreement that would formalize partition, fearing Turkey would seek to control the entire island in light of its demand to maintain a permanent troop presence and military intervention rights in Cyprus. Turkey also insists the minority Turkish Cypriots should have veto rights over all federal government decisions.",
      "Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides told reporters in Greek afterward that the results were in the right direction.",
      "\u201cYes, there could have been better results if there was the necessary political will, but I believe that, given the circumstances before us, we had significant results,\u201d he said.",
      "The meeting also included the foreign ministers of guarantor countries Turkey and Greece and a United Kingdom deputy minister.",
      "Despite differences on the future of Cyprus, the rivals have made some progress on trust-building measures.",
      "Guterres told reporters that four initiatives had been achieved: creating a technical committee on youth; initiatives on the environment and climate change, including the impact on mining areas; the restoration of cemeteries; and an agreement on demining, where technical details still need to be finalized.",
      "He said discussions will continue on opening four new crossings between the Greek and Turkish sides of the island and on solar energy in the buffer zone between them, which is patrolled by a U.N. peacekeeping force.",
      "Tatar accused Christodoulides of preventing the announcement of the four border crossings on Thursday by insisting that one of them go through the buffer zone, which he called unacceptable to Turkish Cypriots.",
      "He also sharply criticized Greek Cypriots for pursuing legal action over the sale of properties in the Turkish Cypriot north, saying the moves \u201care certainly damaging to the relations of the two peoples and are aimed at damaging our economy and our tourism.\u201d",
      "Property rights are a deeply contentious issue in Cyprus. A recent boom in construction of luxury villas and apartments in the north has prompted Cypriot legal authorities to take a more assertive stance toward realtors and developers to discourage what they say is the large-scale \u201cillegal usurpation\u201d of Greek Cypriot land.",
      "Guterres said the meeting also produced an understanding on a consultative body for civil society engagement, exchange of cultural artifacts, an initiative on air quality monitoring and addressing microplastic pollution.",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- With record temperatures hitting the U.S., pet owners have to protect their four-legged family members from dangers like heat stroke and dehydration.",
      "But keeping an animal the size of a small car cool isn\u2019t as easy as bringing it inside to the air conditioning. That\u2019s why Alicia Grace, owner of Pink Flamingo Stables, has to take extra steps to keep her horses safe and healthy in South Florida\u2019s hot and humid climate.",
      "Grace cares for eight full-size horses and three ponies on her Lake Worth Beach property. South Florida has a large equestrian community, especially in Palm Beach County with the National Polo Center located in Wellington. But the climate isn\u2019t ideal for horses, which generally do better in drier, cooler environments, Grace said.",
      "\u201cNot only do we have the heat, but we also have all the humidity,\u201d Grace said. \u201cAnd with that comes the bugs \u2014 flies and mosquitoes \u2014 which can actually breed in their cuts and cause all sorts of issues.\u201d",
      "Grace said it\u2019s important to keep the horses hydrated and out of the sun during the hottest parts of the day. All paddocks have shaded areas, and barns are equipped with large fans.",
      "\u201cThey always have constant access to water,\u201d Grace said. \u201cWe bathe them daily, and we have cooling blankets that you can actually put on after a ride.\u201d",
      "While cats and dogs can be brought inside to cool, conditioned air on especially hot days, that\u2019s not as easy for horses and other large animals.",
      "\u201cThey actually do now make air conditioning units for horses, but they are quite expensive,\u201d Grace said. \u201cIt is definitely a different animal and definitely requires a lot more care.\u201d",
      "Besides concerns about overheating or dehydration, horses are also vulnerable to algae and fungus that thrive in the South Florida climate.",
      "\u201cWe get a lot of flooding during our rainy season, and if the horses are out in that and their hooves get saturated, they can get abscesses, which are pus pockets, and get a lot of problems with their feet,\u201d Grace said.",
      "Cats, dogs and other house pets are easier to keep cool, but pet owners still have to remain vigilant during the summer, Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control spokeswoman Arielle Weinberger said. Just like horses, any cats and dogs kept outside need shade and water.",
      "Officials are especially concerned about pet owners leaving dogs and cats inside vehicles. Local laws might vary throughout the state, but it's illegal to leave animals unattended in vehicles for any amount of time in Palm Beach County, Weinberger said. During hot weather, she said the temperature inside a vehicle can increase 20 degrees in just 10 minutes.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure that no animals are left unattended, and that includes even if the window is cracked, even if the A/C is on,\u201d Weinberger said. \u201cAnimals cannot be unattended in a vehicle, it is for their safety.\u201d",
      "Dog owners especially need to check pavement, Weinberger said. Concrete and asphalt can reach temperatures of up to 125 degrees (52 degrees) during the summer months, so finding grass or dirt for pets to walk on is ideal. If that's not practical, pet owners might need to invest in booties or paw wax.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s too hot for you to touch with a bare foot or a bare hand, it\u2019s too hot for your pets, as well,\u201d Weinberger said.",
      "People who don't actually own pets can also help to keep animals safe, whether it's community cats or local wildlife, by leaving water outside, Weinberger said. Animal control officers will respond to pets and livestock suffering from signs of dehydration or heat stroke, but Weinberger said residents should call local wildlife rescue facilities if they see a raccoon or other wild animal in bad shape.",
      "If an animal seems overheated, it can be cooled down with water on their head, stomach and feet. But if they start to experience symptoms like diarrhea, lethargy, dizziness and vomiting, it's time to seek medical attention, Weinberger said.",
      "\u201cWe want to take them to the vet as soon as possible, because heat stroke can lead to organ failure, and we want to make sure that it doesn\u2019t get to that,\u201d Weinberger said.",
      "Matthew Puodziukaitis, 19, of Wellington, regularly brings his mini goldendoodle, Hazel, to the Okeeheelee Park dog area. He said he always brings a bottle of cold water and a bowl for Hazel and any other dogs who might need it.",
      "\"The last thing you want is a dog passing out or something bad happening to them out here,\" Puodziukaitis said. \u201cThey\u2019re basically like a little kid. You want to make sure they\u2019re okay.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Federal health officials will allow Juul to keep selling its electronic cigarettes",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration is allowing vaping brand Juul to keep its e-cigarettes on the market, providing relief to a company that has struggled for years after being widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend.",
      "FDA regulators said Thursday that studies from Juul show its e-cigarettes are less harmful for adult smokers, who can benefit from switching completely to vaping.",
      "The FDA decision applies to both tobacco- and menthol-flavored versions of the reusable product, which works with nicotine-filled cartridges sold in two different strengths. Juul previously discontinued several fruit and candy flavors that helped drive its popularity but were favored by teens.",
      "Juul will be one of only two U.S. companies authorized to sell menthol-flavored vapes, which many adults prefer to tobacco flavor.",
      "\u201cThis is an important milestone for the company and I think we made a scientifically sound case for the role that menthol can play in e-vapor,\u201d Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite told The Associated Press.",
      "Parents, politicians and antitobacco groups are certain to oppose FDA\u2019s decision. They have argued for years that Juul should be permanently banned from selling its products due to its role in triggering a yearslong spike in underage vaping",
      "Juul was once valued at over $13 billion and its small, sleek e-cigarettes revolutionized the image and technology of the vaping industry. But the company has since been forced to slash hundreds of jobs and pay billions to settle lawsuits over its role in the rise of youth vaping.",
      "The FDA had ordered the company to remove its products from the market in June 2022. But then the agency abruptly reversed course and agreed to reopen its scientific review of Juul\u2019s application after the company pushed back in court.",
      "Juul said that regulators had overlooked thousands of pages of scientific data critical to its submission.",
      "Thursday\u2019s announcement is not an approval or endorsement, and the FDA reiterated that people who do not smoke should not use Juul or any other e-cigarettes. The FDA determination indicates that smokers who switch completely to Juul can reduce their exposure to deadly carcinogens and other chemicals found in traditional cigarettes.",
      "The FDA decision applies to Juul's original product, which is now roughly a decade old. Crosthwaite said the company hopes to win authorization for its next-generation device and is also considering applying to FDA for more flavors.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has authorized a handful of e-cigarettes to help adult smokers cut back on traditional cigarettes, while rejecting more than a million other vaping products that failed to meet agency standards. Juul's main competitors, Vuse and Njoy, each previously received FDA permission to remain on the market.",
      "To meet FDA requirements, companies must show that their e-cigarettes benefit public health. In practice, that means proving that adult smokers who use them are likely to quit or reduce their smoking, while teens are unlikely to get hooked on them.",
      "The brainchild of two Stanford University students, Juul launched in 2015 and within two years rocketed to the top of the vaping market.",
      "Juul quickly outpaced earlier brands with its high-nicotine, fruity-flavored vape cartridges, sold in mango, mint and creme brul\u00e9. The company's small, discrete devices provided a more potent, user-friendly alternative to older, bulkier devices.",
      "But the company\u2019s rise was fueled by underage use, and e-cigarettes quickly became ubiquitous in U.S. high schools and middle schools. In 2019, the company was pressured into halting all advertising and eliminating most of its flavors, leaving only tobacco and menthol-flavored cartridges for its device.",
      "By then the company was already the target of multiple investigations and lawsuits by Congress, state and local officials and class action attorneys.",
      "In 2022, the company paid $1.7 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits brought by families of Juul users, school districts, city governments and Native American tribes. The company has separately agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle lawsuits with most U.S. states.",
      "Juul is no longer the top-selling e-cigarette brand and now trails Vuse, which is sold by Reynolds American.",
      "Teens have also shifted away from the brand amid a wider drop in vaping, according to the latest federal survey. The FDA reported last year that teen vaping dropped to a 10-year low, after stepped up enforcement against unauthorized brands imported from China, such as Elf Bar.",
      "Unlike Juul, disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar still come in fruit and candy flavors, despite efforts by regulators to block their use.",

      "Jason worked for Voice of America and made threatening calls using phone lines connected to studios and control rooms at the news agency's headquarters in Washington, according to U.S. Capitol Police.",
      "Jason, of Edgewater, Maryland, also volunteered as a reserve officer for the Anne Arundel County Police Department in Maryland. The department said in a statement that Jason had served as a volunteer since 2016.",
      "\u201cAnne Arundel County Reserve Officers are unarmed and have no police authority. Mr. Jason is no longer affiliated with the Anne Arundel County Police Department,\u201d the statement said.",
      "A lawyer for Jason did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "A grand jury indicted Jason on charges of influencing a federal official by threat, influencing a federal official by threatening a family member, interstate communications with a threat to kidnap or injure and anonymous telecommunications harassment.",
      "Jason was expected to make his initial court appearance in Washington on Thursday.",
      "\u201cNo one should have to live their life looking over their shoulder every day and wondering if those threats are about to be fulfilled and about to come true,\u201d acting U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said at a news conference.",
      "Pirro read aloud some of the statements that Jason is accused of making during the calls to Greene's offices.",
      "\u201cI am looking forward to your book signing. We are all armed and ready to take care of you,\u201d Jason said, according to Pirro.",
      "Threats against members of Congress and other public officials have surged as the nation's political landscape has become increasingly divisive.",
      "During the news conference, Capitol Police Chief Michael Sullivan alluded to the June 14 shootings in Minnesota by a man charged with killing the Democratic leader in the state House and her husband after wounding another lawmaker and his wife.",
      "\u201cThis has got to stop,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThis has changed since Minnesota. We are going to work very, very hard to hold you accountable if you make these threats.\u201d",

      "Legal advocates have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to restore deportation protection for migrant children and youth who suffered parental abuse, neglect, or abandonment",
      "Attorneys representing migrant children who were abused, neglected or abandoned by a parent asked a federal court on Thursday to restore their deportation protections after the Trump administration ended them.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Eastern District of New York, was filed on behalf of nine young people and their legal advocates who want a judge to keep the protections for up to nearly 150,000 beneficiaries.",
      "\u201cThese young people have survived abuse, abandonment, and neglect only to be retraumatized now by the constant threat of detention and deportation from the same agencies that vowed to keep them safe,\" said Rachel Davidson, plaintiff attorney with the National Immigration Project.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services were both named in the lawsuit. USCIS Spokesman Matthew J. Tragesser said, \u201cAs a matter of practice, USCIS does not comment on pending litigation.\u201d DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Migrant children who suffered parental abuse, neglect or abandonment are designated through state courts and the federal government with Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, which was created by Congress in 1990 with bipartisan support.",
      "SIJS, as it is known, does not grant legal status. But it lets qualifying young people apply for a visa to become legal permanent residents and obtain a work permit. It can take years for a visa to become available due to annual caps. In 2022, the Biden administration allowed children to be shielded from deportation while waiting for a visa.",
      "In June, the Trump administration ended deportation protection for SIJS beneficiaries. Without it, they can still wait in the U.S. for a visa but cannot receive work authorization. And if they are deported while they are waiting, they will no longer be eligible to become legal permanent residents.",
      "Though overshadowed by higher-profile moves to end birthright citizenship and halt asylum at the border, the policy shift is part of President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration system overhaul intended to make it more difficult for people to legally remain in the U.S.",
      "A Guatemalan teen who is living in New York and living with her older brother is one of the plaintiffs. She said through attorneys, who omit using the names of minors, that her dreams of becoming an astronaut one day may be cut short if she's unable to continue high school for fear of deportation.",
      "\u201cI felt that I was finally in a safe environment, but if I had to return to (Guatemala), I would be very afraid of the violence and abuse from my mother and father,\u201d she said in a statement shared by the attorneys without her name.",
      "The policy shift may shut down a legal pathway to possible citizenship for nearly 150,000 migrants who attorneys estimate have received this classification and are stuck in the visa backlog.",
      "It could keep them from obtaining Social Security cards, driver\u2019s licenses, medical treatment, health insurance, higher education, bank accounts, and, for older youth, legal and safe employment opportunities.",

      "Five immigrants deported by the United States to the small southern African nation of Eswatini under the Trump administration\u2019s secretive third-country program are in prison, where they will be held in solitary confinement for an undetermined time",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Five immigrants deported by the United States to the small southern African nation of Eswatini under the Trump administration's third-country program are in prison, where they will be held in solitary confinement for an undetermined time, a government spokesperson said.",
      "Thabile Mdluli, the spokesperson, declined to identify the correctional facility or facilities where the five men are, citing security concerns. She said Eswatini planned to ultimately repatriate the five to their home countries with the help of a United Nations agency.",
      "In cell phone messages to The Associated Press on Thursday, Mdluli said it wasn't clear how long that would take.",
      "The men, who the U.S. says were convicted of serious crimes and were in the U.S. illegally, are citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos. Their convictions included murder and child rape, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said, describing them as \"uniquely barbaric.\"",
      "Their deportations were announced by Homeland Security on Tuesday and mark the continuation of President Donald Trump's plan to send deportees to third countries they have no ties with after it was stalled by a legal challenge in the United States.",
      "Here's what we know and don't know about the deportations:",
      "Eswatini, a country of 1.2 million people bordering South Africa, is the latest nation to accept third-country deportees from the U.S. The Trump administration has sent hundreds of Venezuelans and others to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama, and deported eight men earlier this month to South Sudan, also an African country.",
      "The deportees to South Sudan are citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan. They were held for weeks in a converted shipping container at a U.S. military base in the nearby country of Djibouti until a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for them to be finally sent to South Sudan. The U.S. also described them as violent criminals.",
      "Eswatini's government confirmed on Wednesday that the latest five deportees were in its custody after landing on a deportation plane from the U.S.",
      "Local media reported they are being held at the Matsapha Correctional Complex, outside the country's administrative capital of Mbabane, which includes Eswatini's top maximum-security prison.",
      "The Eswatini government said the men are \u201cin transit\u201d and will eventually be sent to their home countries. The U.S. and Eswatini governments would work with the U.N. migration agency to do that, it said.",
      "The U.N. agency \u2014 the International Organization for Migration or IOM \u2014 said it was not involved in the operation and has not been approached to assist in the matter but would be willing to help \u201cin line with its humanitarian mandate.\u201d",
      "Eswatini's statement that the men would be sent home was in contrast to U.S. claims they were sent to Eswatini because their home countries refused to take them back.",
      "It's unclear how sending the men to Eswatini would make it easier for them to be deported home. There was also no timeframe for that as it depends on several factors, including engagements with the IOM, Mdluli said.",
      "\u201cWe are not yet in a position to determine the timelines for the repatriation,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Four of the five countries where the men are from have historically resisted taking back some of their citizens deported from the U.S., which has been a reoccurring problem for Homeland Security. Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the administration was happy the men were \u201coff of American soil\u201d when she announced their deportations.",
      "There have been no details on why Eswatini agreed to take the men and Mdluli, the government spokesperson, said \"the terms of the agreement between the U.S. and Eswatini remain classified.\u201d",
      "Eswatini has said it was the result of months of negotiations between the two governments. South Sudan has also given no details of its agreement with the U.S. to take deportees and has declined to say where the eight men sent there are being held.",
      "Some analysts say African nations might be willing to take deportees from the U.S. in return for more favorable relations with the Trump administration, which has cut foreign aid to poor countries and threatened them with trade tariffs.",
      "The Trump administration has also said it's seeking more deportation deals with other countries.",
      "Rights groups have questioned the countries the U.S. has chosen to deal with, as South Sudan and Eswatini have both been criticized for having repressive governments.",
      "Eswatini is Africa's only absolute monarchy, meaning the king has power over government and rules by decree. Political parties are banned and pro-democracy protests have been quelled violently in the past.",
      "Several rights groups have criticized Eswatini since pro-democracy protests erupted there in 2021, citing deadly crackdowns by security forces and abusive conditions in prisons, including at the Matsapha Correctional Complex, where pro-democracy activists are held.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- A former Philadelphia police officer who shot and killed a motorist during a traffic stop was sentenced and granted parole Thursday by a judge, eliciting condemnations from the city's district attorney and the victim's family.",
      "Judge Glenn Bronson sentenced Mark Dial to 9 1/2 months in jail, and immediately granted Dial parole because he had already been jailed for 10 months following his arrest in 2023.",
      "A jury in May acquitted Dial, 29, of murder charges, and instead convicted him of voluntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and possessing an instrument of crime in the fatal shooting of 27-year-old Eddie Irizarry.",
      "Brian McMonagle, Dial's lawyer, said the judge did the right thing for a \u201cdedicated public servant\u201d who \u201crisked his life every day for perfect strangers.\u201d",
      "District Attorney Larry Krasner said the judge went \u201cway below\u201d sentencing guidelines in handing down a sentence that set Dial free. The low end of the standard range of sentencing guidelines for the conviction was 4 1/2 to nine years in prison, he said.",
      "Krasner declined to criticize the judge but said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed with a verdict that I think makes people lose faith in the criminal justice system.\u201d",
      "Zoraida Garcia, an aunt of Irizarry's, told reporters after the sentencing that if she had committed the crime, \u201cI would have been doing life in prison. But he\u2019s a cop, so he gets the OK.\u201d Another aunt, Ana Cintron, said, \u201cmy nephew\u2019s life doesn\u2019t matter at all.\"",
      "In court, Bronson said the shooting was not \u201ca classic voluntary manslaughter case,\u201d that Dial's conduct was \u201cdemonstrably out of character\u201d and that Dial was not a threat to the public, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.",
      "He also said that Dial, after shooting Irizarry six times, rushed Irizarry to the hospital.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that happen in a voluntary manslaughter case,\u201d he said.",
      "Dial's lawyers have insisted that the 2023 shooting was justified.",
      "They say Dial thought Irizarry had a gun when he approached Irizarry's car after officers spotted the car being driven erratically and followed it for several blocks before it turned the wrong way down a one-way street and stopped.",
      "Police body camera video of the shooting shows Dial getting out of a police SUV, striding over to Irizarry\u2019s car and firing his weapon six times at close range through the rolled-up driver\u2019s side window.",
      "The video shows Irizarry holding a seven-inch knife before he was shot.",
      "Another officer yelled \u201cknife\u201d as they had approached the vehicle, according to the video, but Dial\u2019s attorneys disputed those assertions, saying the other officer yelled \u201cGun!,\u201d that the knife resembled a gun and that Dial had acted lawfully and in self-defense.",
      "Dial was released from custody in 2024 after prosecutors withdrew a first-degree murder charge.",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The U.S. Justice Department is recommending an ex-Kentucky police officer convicted of using excessive force during the deadly Breonna Taylor raid should serve no prison time, an abrupt about-face after spending years prosecuting the former detective.",
      "Brett Hankison is the only officer who fired his weapon the night of the March 2020 botched drug raid who has faced criminal charges. His shots didn't hit or injure anyone, though they flew through Taylor's walls into a neighboring apartment.",
      "A federal judge will decide Hankison's sentence, which could amount to several years, on Tuesday at a hearing. If the judge heeds the Justice Department's request, it would mean that none of the Louisville police officers involved in the botched raid would face any prison time.",
      "The Justice Department, which has changed leadership under President Donald Trump since Hankison's conviction, said in a sentencing memo this week that \"there is no need for a prison sentence to protect the public\u201d from Hankison. Federal prosecutors asked the judge to sentence him to time served, which amounts to one day, and three years of supervised probation.",
      "Prosecutors at his previous federal trials aggressively pursued a conviction against Hankison, arguing that he blindly fired 10 shots into Taylor's windows without identifying a target. Taylor was shot in her hallway by two other officers after her boyfriend fired from inside the apartment, striking an officer in the leg.",
      "But in the sentencing memo, federal prosecutors wrote that though Hankison's \u201cresponse in these fraught circumstances was unreasonable given the benefit of hindsight, that unreasonable response did not kill or wound Breonna Taylor, her boyfriend, her neighbors, defendant\u2019s fellow officers, or anyone else.\u201d",
      "Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who helped Taylor's family secure a $12 million wrongful death settlement against the city of Louisville, said the Justice Department's recommendation \u201cis an insult to the life of Breonna Taylor and a blatant betrayal of the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d",
      "\u201cRecommending just one day in prison sends the unmistakable message that white officers can violate the civil rights of Black Americans with near-total impunity,\u201d Crump said in a statement on social media.",
      "Three other ex-Louisville police officers have been charged with crafting a falsified warrant, but they have not yet gone to trial. None of them were at the scene when Taylor was shot.",
      "The death of the 26-year-old Black woman, along with the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, sparked racial injustice protests nationwide that year.",
      "A separate jury deadlocked on federal charges against Hankison in 2023, and he was acquitted on state charges of wanton endangerment in 2022.",

      "An \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d music supervisor and her husband were found shot to death in their Los Angeles home",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles police officers conducting a welfare check at a home on Monday discovered two bodies inside with gunshot wounds. The victims were identified as Robin Kaye, a longtime music supervisor for \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d and her husband, Thomas Deluca. A day later, police arrested a 22-year-old man in connection with the killings.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Officials said someone who hadn't heard from Kaye and Deluca in several days requested that police check out their residence in the Encino neighborhood, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Officers entered the house Monday afternoon and found a man and woman shot to death. Homicide detectives were called.",
      "The victims were identified on Tuesday as Kaye and Deluca, both 70.",
      "The couple owned their home in the upscale suburb of the San Fernando Valley, according to public records.",
      "Raymond Boodarian, 22, was arrested \u201cwithout incident\u201d Tuesday afternoon, police said in a statement.",
      "Investigators believe Boodarian was burglarizing the home several days earlier while the couple was away. Police had been called to the residence on July 10 but found no signs of trouble or forced entry. Now, detectives suspect that Boodarian managed to get into the house through an unlocked door and was surprised by Kaye and Deluca.",
      "\u201cThe victims returned home while the suspect was inside their residence, and a confrontation ensued, which resulted in the suspect taking their lives,\u201d the police statement says. \u201cThe victims succumbed to multiple gunshot wounds, and the suspect fled from the residence on foot.\u201d",
      "Officers interviewed friends and family, reviewed numerous surveillance videos, and recovered evidence of a homicide at scene, officials said.",
      "Boodarian had not yet been assigned a public defender as of Tuesday evening and could not be reached for comment.",
      "Kaye had been with \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d the hit singing competition TV series, for more than 15 years. She had also worked in the music departments of several other productions such as \u201cThe Singing Bee,\u201d \u201cHollywood Game Night,\u201d \u201cLip Sync Battle,\u201d and several Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants.",
      "\u201cRobin has been a cornerstone of the Idol family since 2009 and was truly loved and respected by all who came in contact with her,\u201d an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cRobin will remain in our hearts forever and we share our deepest sympathy with her family and friends during this difficult time.\u201d",

He wasn't a collector, but knew the value of the sled and quietly preserved it for decades, putting it as an Easter egg into four of his own films.",

    "story": [
      "Felix Baumgartner, the daredevil who made a record-breaking parachute jump from the stratosphere in 2012, died Thursday in a paragliding accident in Italy, a local mayor confirmed. Firefighters who responded to the scene said they found a paraglider that had crashed into the side of a swimming pool in the city of Porto Sant Elpidio, on central Italy's eastern coast.",
      "\"Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,\" the town's Mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said on Facebook.",
      "Baumgartner, 56, made global headlines in 2012 when he was lifted into the stratosphere, about 24 miles up, in a capsule carried by a helium balloon, and then parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico. During the jump, he broke the record for fastest free fall, descending at about 843.6 mph and becoming the first human to break the sound barrier without the assistance of a vehicle.",
      "Originally from Austria, Baumgartner began skydiving at age 16 and further honed his skills in the Austrian military, according to his personal website. In 1988, he teamed up with Red Bull, which sponsored the stratosphere jump under the Stratos project and many other daring feats.",
      "The training and planning for the 2012 Stratos jump took five years. Among the records Baumgartner would break that day was highest jump, which had been held by Air Force Capt. Joe Kittinger since 1960, when he leapt from an open-air gondola basket that rose to 102,000 feet. Kittinger would go on to train Baumgartner for the record-breaking Stratos jump. (Baumgartner's height record was broken two years later.)",
      "In addition to skydiving, Baumgartner was an accomplished BASE jumper, breaking two records in 1999: highest BASE jump and lowest BASE jump. The low jump, which he took from one of the hands of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, was only 95 feet. The high jump was taken from the 88th floor of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, although that record has since been broken and is currently held by the late Valery Rozov, who jumped from Cho Oyu in 2016.",
      "Baumgartner was also a helicopter pilot and was part of Red Bull's aerial acrobatics team.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to jump out of a plane,\" Baumgartner told Red Bull in an interview after becoming a licensed helicopter pilot.",
      "\"For Red Bull Stratos, we had a very long list of 'what ifs,' in other words eventualities that could happen and how we would deal with them in an emergency. The list kept getting longer and longer. I was only afraid of the things that were not on the list. The things we had not thought of,\" he told Red Bull, adding, \"to this day, I abort missions if the conditions are not right.\"",
      "While Baumgartner's stunts inspired millions, his political views were known to cause controversy. On social media, he mocked climate activists and others who sought to limit the effects of climate change, and voiced opposition to LGBTQ rights, according to the AFP news agency. He also once suggested Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-immigration policies.",

    "story": [
      "Connie Francis, the wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose hits include \"Pretty Little Baby\" and whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy, has died, her friend and publicist, Ron Roberts, announced Thursday. She was 87.",
      "\"It is with a heavy heart and extreme sadness that i inform you of the passing of my dear friend Connie Francis last night,\" Roberts said in a statement posted to Facebook at 1:46 a.m. EDT. \"I know that Connie would approve that her fans are among the first to learn of this sad news.\"",
      "In another post Thursday afternoon, Roberts said Francis died Wednesday in a hospital in Pompano Beach, Florida. She had been hospitalized since late June after experiencing hip pain that led to her using a wheelchair and was later determined to be a pelvic fracture. While Francis was being treated in an intensive care unit, it was confirmed on Tuesday that she had pneumonia, Roberts said.",
      "Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \"Who's Sorry Now?\" and including the No. 1 songs \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\" and \"The Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\" Like other teen favorites of her time, she also starred in several films, including \"Where the Boys Are\" and \"Follow the Boys.\"",
      "The dark-haired singer was just 17 when she signed a contract with MGM Records following appearances on several TV variety shows. Her earliest recordings attracted little attention, but then she released her version of \"Who's Sorry Now?\" an old ballad by Ted Snyder, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.",
      "It, too, had little success initially until Dick Clark played it on his \"American Bandstand\" show in 1958. Francis followed with such teen hits as \"Stupid Cupid,\" \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool,\" and \"Lipstick on Your Collar.\" Her records became hits worldwide as she re-recorded versions of her original songs in Italian and Spanish among other languages. Her concerts around the country quickly sold out.",
      "Decades after recording \"Pretty Little Baby\" in the 1960s, the song gained popularity on social media in 2025, being featured in videos on TikTok and Instagram. Francis told the New York Times the song went unnoticed when it was originally released.",
      "\"It's a cute song,\" Francis said. \"I couldn't imagine that it has the effect that it has worldwide on people \u2014 it's hard to believe. I wanted something for the B-side of a single and I chose something that wouldn't give my A-side any competition. I don't even know the name of the record that I put it on. But I think it has a ring of innocence in this chaotic time and it connects with people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a romance bloomed with fellow teen idol Bobby Darin, who had volunteered to write songs for her. But when her father heard rumors that the pair were planning a wedding he stormed into a rehearsal and pulled a gun on Darin, ending their relationship and seeming to set on Francis on a pained and traumatic path.",
      "She chronicled some of it in her autobiography, \"Who's Sorry Now?\"",
      "\"My personal life is a regret from A to Z,\" she told The Associated Press in 1984, the year the book came out. \"I realized I had allowed my father to exert too much influence over me.\"",
      "Her father, George Franconero, was a roofing contractor from New Jersey who played the accordion, and he had his daughter learn the instrument as soon as she began to show an aptitude for music. When she was 4, he began booking singing dates for her, going on to become her manager.",
      "Although her acting career had faded by the mid-1960s, Francis was still popular on the concert circuit when she appeared at the Westbury Music Center in Westbury, New York, in 1974. She had returned to her hotel room and was asleep when a man broke in and raped her at knifepoint. He was never captured.",
      "Francis sued the hotel, alleging its security was faulty, and a jury awarded her $2.5 million in 1976. The two sides then settled out of court for $1,475,000 as an appeal was pending. She said the attack destroyed her marriage and put her through years of emotional turmoil.",
      "She suffered tragedy in 1981 when her brother George was shot to death as he was leaving his New Jersey home. Later in the decade, her father had her committed to a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed as manic-depressive. At one point she attempted suicide by swallowing dozens of sleeping tablets. After three days in a coma, she recovered.",
      "She was married four times and would say that only her third husband, Joseph Garzilli, was worth the trouble. The other marriages each lasted less than a year.",
      "Concetta Rosemarie Franconero was born on Dec. 12, 1937, in Newark, New Jersey. She was just 3 when her father presented her with a child-size accordion. The next year she began singing and playing the instrument at various public events.",
      "At age 9 she began appearing on television programs, including \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" and \"The Perry Como Show.\" It was Godfrey who suggested she shorten her last name.",
      "Clark featured her repeatedly on \"American Bandstand,\" and she said in later years that without his support she would have abandoned her music career.",

      "He wrote spy novels, westerns and speculative fiction under a variety of pseudonyms and, at the behest of his agent, added Cruz to his name when his 1977 thriller \"Nightwing\" was published. He became an international name with 1981's \"Gorky Park,\" the story of a triple murder in Moscow, and the Russian detective, Arkady Renko, who risks his life to solve it. Rich in mood and gripping in narrative, the book starred a protagonist who stood at odds with his mother country and the political apparatus consuming it.",
      "An international blockbuster, it inspired a film starring William Hurt. But the Soviets were not amused; Smith was blacklisted from the U.S.S.R. \"I could not get back in at that point. I was persona non grata,\" he said.",

I mean, you're up there alone, nobody's there, and sometimes you kind of swivel round just to see if anybody showed up, and no one ever shows up; it's just you.

      "A mosaic panel on travertine slabs, depicting an erotic theme from the Roman era, was returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii on Tuesday, after being stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II.",
      "The mosaic depicts a pair of lovers in a state of undress. A male figure is lounging on a bed or couch, while a female figure is standing, facing away from the viewer.",
      "The artwork was repatriated from Germany through diplomatic channels, arranged by the Italian Consulate in Stuttgart, Germany, after having been returned from the heirs of the last owner, a deceased German citizen.",
      "The owner had received the mosaic as a gift from a Wehrmacht captain, assigned to the military supply chain in Italy during the war.",
      "The mosaic \u2014 dating between mid- to last century B.C. and the first century \u2014 is considered a work of \"extraordinary cultural interest,\" experts said. It may have decorated the floor of a bedroom, the Archaeological Park of Pompeii said in a news release.",
      "\"It is the moment when the theme of domestic love becomes an artistic subject,\" said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii and co-author of an essay dedicated to the returned work. \"While the Hellenistic period, from the fourth to the first century B.C., exulted the passion of mythological and heroic figures, now we see a new theme.\"",
      "The heirs of the mosaic's last owner in Germany contacted the Carabinieri unit in Rome that's dedicated to protecting cultural heritage, which was in charge of the investigation, asking for information on how to return the mosaic to the Italian state. Authorities carried out the necessary checks to establish its authenticity and provenance, and then worked to repatriate the mosaic in September 2023.",
      "The collaboration with the Archaeological Park of Pompeii was also key, as it made it possible to trace it to near the Mount Vesuvius volcano, despite the scarcity of data on the original context of its discovery, the Carabinieri said.",
      "The panel was then assigned to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii where, suitably catalogued, it will be protected and available for educational and research purposes. Photos show the tile on display, behind a glass cover. A small crowd gathered to look at and photograph the piece.",
      "\"Today's return is like healing an open wound,\" Zuchtriegel said, adding that the mosaic allows to reconstruct the story of that period, the first century A.D., before Pompeii was destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption in A.D. 79.",
      "The park's director also highlighted how the return by the heirs of its owner signals an important change in \"mentality,\" as \"the sense of possession (of stolen art) becomes a heavy burden.\"",
      "\"We see that often in the many letters we receive from people who may have stolen just a stone, to bring home a piece of Pompeii,\" Zuchtriegel said.",
      "Photos posted on social media by the Archaeological Park of Pompeii show the mosaic being handed over by police and later being put on display.",
      "Zuchtriegel recalled the so-called \"Pompeii curse,\" which according to a popular superstition hits whoever steals artifacts in Pompeii.",
      "The world-known legend suggests that those who steal finds from the ancient city of Pompeii will experience bad luck or misfortune. That has been fueled over the years by several tourists who return stolen items, claiming they brought them bad luck and caused tragic events.",

But if I turned it up just a little bit, my cousins would laugh ... that was where I discovered deadpan.\"",

      "He said that self-discovery comes through connection with others rather than isolation.",

In recent days, O'Donnell on social media denounced Mr. Trump and recent moves by his administration, including the signing of a massive GOP-backed tax breaks and spending cuts plan.",

    "story": [
      "An off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot indicted for trying to shut off a passenger jet's engines mid-flight in 2023 recalled the scary moment he slipped out of reality after eating \"magic mushrooms.\"",
      "Former airline captain Joseph Emerson said he takes full responsibility for the night in October 2023 that changed his life.",
      "\"I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,\" he said in an interview that aired on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday.",
      "At the time, Emerson said he had been grieving the death of his best friend and first turned to alcohol before experimenting with the psychedelic drug. Two days after trying so-called 'magic mushrooms' for the first time, he boarded Alaska Air Flight 2059 as a passenger from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco. It was a full flight, with 83 other passengers and crew on board, so he was given the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer.",
      "\"Most consequential three seconds of my life\"",
      "Suddenly, he said he felt a sense of \"all-out panic and fear\" on the plane as the drugs altered his perception of reality.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson recalled thinking as he pulled the handles that cut off fuel to the engines in the event of a fire.",
      "While in the apparent dissociative state, Emerson said he didn't realize the serious consequences of his actions.",
      "\"I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life,\" Emerson said.",
      "The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was arrested. He's set to be arraigned next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and faces a host of state charges including 83 misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person and one felony count of first-degree endangering aircraft.",
      "The case reignited the conversation about barriers facing pilots when it comes to their mental health.",
      "Pilots' mental health",
      "Disclosing mental health issues can lead to a pilot being grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, putting their ability to work at risk for an extended period of time, possibly lasting years. A 2022 study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine estimated 56% of pilots avoid seeking medical care due to fear of losing their certification to fly.",
      "\"I came to an understanding, or a misunderstanding, that I needed to be perfect on paper. I needed to show up and appear perfect, no matter what else was going on for me,\" Emerson said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has since held a first of its kind pilot mental health forum to review existing pilot mental health rules. The FAA also launched a review of policies \u2013 both calling for changes to address barriers to care.",
      "\"We need to have a system that allows people to be more forthcoming and to have treatment for issues that shouldn't keep you out of the cockpit,\" then-FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said months after the incident, in December 2023.",
      "The FAA review committee made 24 recommendations.",
      "Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are leading an effort in Congress to enact reforms within two years, introducing the bipartisan\u00a0Mental Health in Aviation Act\u00a0to help pilots and air traffic controllers get access to mental health care and hire additional medical examiners.",
      "\"The goal really simply is to make our skies safer and make our pilots safer. That's it,\" Casten told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The bill would also require the FAA to annually review and update the process related to mental health-related special issuance of medical certificates to pilots and air traffic controllers, set aside 13.74 million dollars a year for the next three years to hire additional certified Aviation Medical Examiners, and authorize a three year $4.5 million dollar public information campaign aimed at destigmatizing mental health care among pilots and air traffic controllers.",
      "\"Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,\" Stauber added.",
      "The bill maintains the FAA's rigorous process for determining a pilot is safe to resume flying but aims to cut red tape and increase transparency. It has unanimously passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last month and has the backing of the largest pilot unions. The bill has advanced to the House of Representatives for consideration. The FAA declined to comment on the bill.",
      "Emerson says he's been sober since the incident. He and his wife have started a nonprofit, Clear Skies Ahead, aimed at improving pilot health and wellness.",

    "summary": "Arkansas State Sen. Bryan King has been trying to repeal a 2011 mandate that added fluoride to most public drinking water.",
    "story": [
      "Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont this week signed legislation requiring the state to keep fluoride at existing levels. But Florida and Utah have banned adding fluoride to drinking water, and other states may follow, as the decades-old practice of adding it to public drinking is facing renewed attacks, including from the federal government.",
      "Arkansas state Sen. Bryan King, a cattle and poultry farmer in Fayetteville, told CBS News he has \"concerns\" about adding fluoride to water.",
      "Since 2011, when the state mandated most public drinking water to include fluoride,  King has thrown his anti-fluoride voice behind a handful of bills seeking to repeal that mandate.",
      "Fluoride is a natural mineral. It strengthens teeth and fights dental decay. It's been added to the U.S.'s public drinking supply since the 1940s.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rated fluoride as one of the top ten public health achievements of the 20th century.",
      "And according to\u00a0the American Dental Association, \"70 years of research, thousands of studies and the experience of more than 210 million Americans tell us that water fluoridation is effective in preventing cavities and is safe for children and adults.\"",
      "\"If that's the case, they need to individually go out to each water district and sell it to the people there, and let them make their own water decisions,\" King said.",
      "At least 19 states have considered legislation to remove, ban or make fluoride optional in public drinking water this year. One of fluoride's most prominent critics is Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "In the latest skirmish over science, fluoride opponents argue that at high levels, it can lead to kidney and liver damage and lower IQs in children.",
      "The National Institutes of Health's toxicology program in 2024\u00a0determined\u00a0\"with moderate confidence\" that there is a link between high levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQs in children. That conclusion was based on studies involving fluoride levels of about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has\u00a0questioned\u00a0the validity of the NIH's report, noting it had \"important limitations,\" including the high fluoride levels, and that other reviews have come to different conclusions about fluoride's risks and benefits.",
      "The EPA in 2011\u00a0lowered\u00a0the recommended limit for fluoride in water to cut down on fluorosis \u2014 when spots appear on kids' teeth \u2014 and in the wake of a 2006\u00a0report\u00a0from the National Academy of Sciences that found a lifetime of overconsumption of fluoride can lead to weakened, brittle bones and teeth.",
      "At Arkansas' Fort Smith water system, Lance McAvoy, who oversees the system, told CBS News it's monitored 24/7.",
      "\"We actually take samples every 15 minutes to verify the online equipment,\" McAvoy said, adding there had never been an instance of significantly higher fluoride levels to date.",
      "Dentists such as Kenton Ross, who also serves as president of Arkansas' dental association, say the science supporting fluoride is indisputable.",
      "\"You're gonna see a 25% reduction in tooth decay,\" Ross said of adding fluoride to drinking water. \"We have over 75 years of research over community fluoridation.\"",
      "For dentists, losing fluoride could mean losing the battle against tooth decay.",

    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's own policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol,\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's own community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term 'ana' is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a U.K. charity that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under 18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuctions.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform which has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware through its own research of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview, but its global head of safety Antigone Davis said, \"we want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

      "The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, will be the first major law governing digital currency, establishing a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency, since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.",
      "The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed.",
      "Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what they dubbed \"Crypto Week\" in Congress. The\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump is scheduled to sign the GENIUS Act in a ceremony at the White House at 2:30 p.m. ET.",
      "The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week.",
      "Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.",

Mr. Trump has\u00a0faced increasing pressure\u00a0to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence.",

      "Insurers want higher premiums to cover the usual culprits \u2014 rising medical and labor costs and usage \u2014 but are tacking on extra percentage point increases in their 2026 rate proposals to cover effects of policy changes advanced by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. One key factor built into their filings with state insurance departments: uncertainty over whether Congress allows more generous, COVID-era ACA tax subsidies to expire at the end of December.",
      "\"The out-of-pocket change for individuals will be immense, and many won't actually be able to make ends meet and pay premiums, so they will go uninsured,\" said JoAnn Volk, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.",
      "Especially if the higher subsidies expire, insurance premiums will be among the first financial pains felt by health care consumers after policy priorities put forward by President Trump and the GOP. Many other changes \u2014 such as additional paperwork requirements and spending cuts to Medicaid \u2014 won't occur for at least another year. But spiking ACA premiums, as the nation heads into key midterm elections, invites political pushback. Some on Capitol Hill are exploring ways to temper the subsidy reductions.",
      "\"I am hearing on both sides \u2014 more from Republicans, but from both the House and Senate\" \u2014 that they are looking for levers they can pull, said Pennsylvania-based insurance broker Joshua Brooker, who follows legislative actions as part of his job and sits on several insurance advisory groups.",

      "Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services responded to requests for comment.",
      "These are initial numbers and insurance commissioners in some states may alter requests before approval.",
      "Still, \"it's the biggest increase we've seen in over five years,\" said analysis co-author Cynthia Cox, a KFF vice president and director of its Program on the ACA.",
      "Premiums will vary based on where consumers live, the type of plan they choose, and their insurer.",
      "For example, Maryland insurers have requested increases ranging from 8.1% to 18.7% for the upcoming plan year, according to an analysis of a smaller set of insurers by Georgetown University researchers. A much larger swing is seen in New York, where one carrier is asking for less than a 1% increase, while another wants 66%. Maryland rate filings indicated the average statewide increase would shrink to 7.9% from 17.1% \u2014 if the ACA's enhanced tax credits are extended.",
      "Most insurers are asking for 10% to 20% increases, the KFF report says, with several factors driving those increases. For instance, insurers say underlying medical costs \u2014 including the use of expensive obesity drugs \u2014 will add about 8% to premiums for next year. And most insurers are also adding 4% above what they would have charged had the enhanced tax credits been renewed.",
      "But rising premiums are just part of the picture.",
      "A bigger potential change for consumers' pocketbooks hinges on whether Congress decides to extend more generous tax credits first put in place during President Joe Biden's term as part of the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, then extended through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.",
      "Those laws raised the subsidy amounts people could receive based on their household income and local premium costs and removed a cap that had barred higher earners from even partial subsidy assistance. Higher earners could still qualify for some subsidy but first had to chip in 8.5% of their household income toward the premiums.",
      "Across the board, but especially among lower-income policyholders, bigger subsidies helped fuel record enrollment in ACA plans.",
      "But they're also costly.",
      "A permanent extension could cost $335 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Such an extension was left out of the policy law Mr. Trump signed on July 4 that he called the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill.\" Without action, the extra subsidies will expire at the end of this year, after which the tax credits will revert to less generous pre-pandemic levels.",
      "That means two things: Most enrollees will be on the hook to pay a larger share of their premiums as assistance from federal tax credits declines. Secondly, people whose household income exceeds four times the federal poverty level \u2014 $84,600 for a couple or $128,600 for a family of four this year \u2014 won't get any subsidies at all.",
      "If the subsidies expire, policy experts estimate, the average amount people pay for coverage could rise by an average of more than 75%. In some states, ACA premiums could double.",
      "\"There will be sticker shock,\" said Josh Schultz, strategic engagement manager at Softheon, a New York consulting firm that provides enrollment, billing, and other services to about 200 health insurers, many of which are bracing for enrollment losses.",
      "And enrollment could fall sharply. The Wakely Consulting Group estimates that the combination of expiring tax credits, the Trump law's new paperwork, and other requirements will result in ACA enrollment dropping by as much as 57%.",
      "According to KFF, insurers added premium increases of around 4% just to cover the expiration of the enhanced tax credits, which they fear will lead to lower enrollment. That would further raise costs, insurers say, because people who are less healthy are more likely to grit their teeth and reenroll, leaving insurers with a smaller, but sicker, pool of members.",
      "Less common in the filings submitted so far, but noticeable, are increases pegged to Trump administration tariffs, Cox said.",
      "\"What they are assuming is tariffs will drive drug costs up significantly, with some saying that can have around a 3-percentage-point increase\" in premiums as a result, she said.",
      "Consumers will learn their new premium prices only late in the fall, or when open enrollment for the ACA begins on Nov. 1 and they can start shopping around.",
      "Congress could still act, and discussions are ongoing, said insurance broker Brooker.",
      "Some lawmakers, he said, are consulting with the CBO about the fiscal and coverage effects of various scenarios that don't extend the subsidies as they currently exist but may offer a middle ground. One possibility involves allowing subsidies for families earning as much as five or six times the poverty level, he said.",
      "But any such effort will draw pushback.",
      "Some conservative think tanks, such as the Paragon Health Institute, say the more generous subsides led people to fudge their incomes to qualify and led to other types of fraud, such as brokers signing people up for ACA plans without authorization.",
      "But others note that many consumers \u2014 Democratic and Republican \u2014 have come to rely on the additional assistance. Not extending it could be risky politically. In 2024, 56% of ACA enrollees lived in Republican congressional districts, and 76% were in states won by Mr. Trump.",
      "Allowing the enhanced subsidies to expire could also reshape the market.",
      "Brooker said some people may drop coverage. Others will shift to plans with lower premiums but higher deductibles. One provision of Mr. Trump's new tax law allows people enrolled in either \"bronze\" or \"catastrophic\"-level ACA plans, which are usually the cheapest, to qualify for health savings accounts, which allow people to set aside money, tax-free, to cover health care costs.",
      "\"Naturally, if rates do start going up the way we anticipate, there will be a migration to lower-cost options,\" Brooker said.",

      "On average, taxpayers will save about $2,900 per household in 2026, according to the analysis from the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank focused on taxes. But higher-income Americans are more likely to see a bigger relative boost than lower-income households, their analysis found.",
      "The new law extends the tax cuts in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with many of those provisions otherwise slated to expire at year-end. But the legislation also adds a bevy of new tax breaks, ranging from eliminating taxes on overtime and tips to lifting the state and local taxes deduction from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "About $6 of every $10 in tax breaks will go to the top 20% of households, or people who earn incomes of about $217,000 or more, the Tax Policy Center analysis found.",
      "\"Average tax cuts are generally larger as a percentage of after-tax income for higher income households than for lower income households,\" it noted.",
      "For instance, the typical household in the bottom quintile \u2014 those earning up to $34,600 per year \u2014 will save an average of about $150 in tax payments next year, or 0.8% of their income.",
      "But those in the top quintile, or who earn $217,101 or more, will save an average of $12,540 next year, or 2.5% of their incomes, the analysis found.",

    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of firing Jerome Powell \u2014 whom he first appointed Federal Reserve chair \u2014 earlier this week, after years of on-and-off criticism over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump asked about the idea of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a meeting with lawmakers this week, CBS News has reported, a legally untested move that follows years of on-and-off criticism of the Fed leader leveled by Mr. Trump.",
      "The president's gripes with his handpicked Fed chair \u2014 whom he has called a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule\" \u2014 have largely focused on the central bank's decision to keep interest rates relatively high so far this year, part of an inflation-fighting campaign. Mr. Trump has also taken aim at Powell's handling of a Federal Reserve office renovation project.",
      "Mr. Trump asked a group of House Republicans if he should fire Powell during a Tuesday night Oval Office meeting, sources told CBS News earlier this week. The president told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he'll fire Powell, though he confirmed he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him,\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Who is Jerome Powell, and who appointed him?",
      "Powell is the chair of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first term, replacing Obama appointee Janet Yellen, and the Senate confirmed him in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "\"He's strong, he's committed, he's smart,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech announcing his decision to nominate Powell in 2017, praising Powell's reputation as a \"consensus-builder.\"",
      "Last month, though, Mr. Trump said he initially nominated Powell because he \"listened to someone that I shouldn't have listened to, and Biden shouldn't have reappointed him.\"",
      "Before becoming chair, Powell had served on the central bank's Board of Governors since 2012, when he was initially nominated by former President Barack Obama.",
      "Powell has switched between government and private-sector jobs for much of his career. He worked in investment banking in the 1980s and 1990s, interrupted by a stint as former President George H.W. Bush's undersecretary of the Treasury. For almost 20 years starting in the 1990s, he was a partner at the Carlyle Group investment firm, according to his Fed biography.",
      "A Georgetown-educated lawyer, Powell does not have a Ph.D. in economics, unlike some other former Fed chairs.",
      "Does Jerome Powell have a designated term length?",
      "Federal Reserve chairs serve for four-year terms, so Powell's stint as chair will end in May 2026.",
      "Members of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors, however, serve for 14 years, and Powell's term as a board member ends in January 2028. Yellen resigned from the board after her term as Fed chair ended, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has encouraged Powell to follow suit, though Powell's plans are unclear.",
      "The chair and board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "What does the Federal Reserve do?",
      "The Federal Reserve is the United States' central bank. Made up of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks and a D.C.-based Board of Governors, its responsibilities include regulating the U.S. banking system, serving as a \"lender of last resort\" to banks and running an instant payment system.",
      "But one of the Federal Reserve's highest-profile responsibilities is its role in setting monetary policy. Through its 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which includes Powell, the Fed works independently of elected officials to influence the supply of money in the U.S. economy and the interest rates at which it's lent out, with an eye toward keeping unemployment low and prices stable.",
      "Those two goals \u2014 maximizing employment and minimizing inflation \u2014 are known as the Fed's \"dual mandate.\" But they're in conflict with each other. If the Fed lowers interest rates, it can boost economic growth, but it also runs the risk of overheating the economy and pushing up inflation. And if interest rates are hiked, inflation tends to cool off, but the economy slows down.",
      "The interest rate that the Fed targets is called the Federal Funds Rate, which is what banks charge to lend money to each other overnight. But other interest rates \u2014 from mortgage rates to yields for U.S. government bonds \u2014 tend to follow closely with the Federal Funds Rate, so the Fed's decisions impact borrowing costs for average American consumers and businesses.",
      "Picking the right balance isn't easy, and the Fed often faces criticism for its choices.",
      "Under Powell, the Fed dropped its target interest rate to near 0% at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with the goal of averting an economic catastrophe. But after the economy recovered and inflation soared, the central bank in 2023 hiked interest rates to their highest point in decades, aiming to get inflation under control. The Fed has taken a cautious path since then, cutting rates slightly last year as inflation fell but keeping them steady so far this year.",
      "Last month, the Fed's rate-setting committee said it may cut rates later this year, but there are concerns that inflation \u2014 which is still above the Fed's 2%-per-year target \u2014 could worsen. Powell has also suggested the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could increase inflation.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said last month.",
      "Why is Trump unhappy with the Fed and Jerome Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump is unhappy with the Fed's decision to leave rates stable. For months, the president has pushed the central bank to slash rates immediately, calling Powell \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "The president argued last month that inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates.",
      "\"If he was concerned about Inflation or anything else, then all he has to do is bring the Rate down, so we can benefit on Interest Costs, and raise it in the future when and if these 'other elements' happen (which I doubt they will!),\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He's not the first president to criticize the Fed for high interest rates, which make everything from car loans to mortgages more expensive and can put a damper on the economic growth that tends to make or break presidents' popularity. But Mr. Trump has been unusually vocal.",
      "In a mid-June post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called Powell a \"Total and Complete Moron\" and urged the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to \"override\" him. While Powell is just one of 12 votes on the committee, the chair traditionally has an outsize role in its decisions. The last few decisions to leave interest rates stable have been unanimous.",
      "Mr. Trump had similar issues with Powell during his first term, saying during an earlier interest rate-hiking campaign in 2018 that he was \"not even a little bit happy with my selection\" of Powell. When the Fed cut rates in 2020, Mr. Trump called Powell his \"most improved player.\"",
      "Meanwhile, members of the Trump administration have pressured Powell over a yearslong renovation to the Fed's headquarters complex. In a letter to the central banker, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought called some of the features \"ostentatious,\" and alleged that Powell may have misled Congress about the project's scope or made changes to the plans without getting permission from the right federal bodies.",
      "Mr. Trump has also criticized Powell over the renovations. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he's \"highly unlikely\" to fire Powell \"unless he has to leave for fraud.\" At other points, Mr. Trump has suggested Powell should resign over the project.",
      "Powell said last year he would not resign as chair if asked to do so.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter to Vought and denied allegations that it was overly lavish, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually. Powell added the Fed has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further government review is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a high degree of independence over its own budget, and legally has the power to buy and remodel office spaces in Washington, D.C., as it sees fit.",
      "Is the Fed independent from the rest of the government? And can Trump fire Powell?",
      "The structure of the Fed \u2014 with board members and chairs who serve across multiple administrations \u2014 allows it to make decisions without direct input from politicians.",
      "Whether the president can fire Powell before his term ends is legally untested. Federal law says members of the Federal Reserve board can only be removed by the president before their terms end \"for cause,\" and the Supreme Court found in 1935 that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court did allow Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards, but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell before his term ends could also roil financial markets, analysts and lawmakers from both parties have warned. Mr. Trump acknowledged this risk Wednesday, telling Just The News in an interview, \"They say it would disrupt the market if I did.\"",
      "At some points in the Federal Reserve's 112-year history, including during World War II, the central bank has been more beholden to the needs of the Treasury. But the Fed has operated more independently since 1951, when a public disagreement between the Fed and the Truman administration led the Treasury to agree to let the central bank set interest rates on its own.",
      "There's nothing preventing the president from publicly expressing his views about the Fed, though, as several of Mr. Trump's predecessors have. During his campaign last year, Mr. Trump said he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "\"In my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve, or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in an August 2024 press briefing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in April that Mr. Trump \"has the right to express his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\"",

    "story": [
      "Vaping brand Juul is allowed to keep its electronic cigarettes on the market, the Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday.",
      "FDA regulators said Juul's studies show its e-cigarettes are less harmful for adult smokers, who can benefit from switching completely to vaping.",
      "The decision comes after the brand has struggled for years after being widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend.",
      "The FDA decision applies to both tobacco- and menthol-flavored versions of the reusable product, which works with nicotine-filled cartridges sold in two different strengths. Juul previously discontinued several fruit and candy flavors that helped drive its popularity but were favored by teens.",
      "Juul will be one of only two U.S. companies authorized to sell menthol-flavored vapes, which many adults prefer to tobacco flavor.",
      "\"This is an important milestone for the company and I think we made a scientifically sound case for the role that menthol can play in e-vapor,\" Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite told The Associated Press.",
      "Critic calls decision \"a big step in the wrong direction\"",
      "Parents, politicians and anti-tobacco groups are certain to oppose the FDA's decision. They have argued for years that Juul products should be permanently banned due to their role in triggering a yearslong spike in underage vaping.",
      "\"It is a big step in the wrong direction to authorize sales of the product that was responsible for this public health crisis in the first place,\" Yolonda Richardson, CEO of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement.",
      "Juul was once valued at more than $13 billion, and its small, sleek e-cigarettes revolutionized the image and technology of the vaping industry. But the company has since been forced to slash hundreds of jobs and pay billions to settle lawsuits over its role in the rise of youth vaping.",
      "The FDA had ordered the company to remove its products from the market in June 2022. But then the agency abruptly reversed course days later and agreed to reopen its scientific review of Juul's application after the company pushed back in court.",
      "At the time, the FDA had raised concerns over \"potentially harmful chemicals\" in Juul's e-cigarettes and \"insufficient and conflicting data\" it said the company had submitted.",
      "Juul said regulators had overlooked thousands of pages of scientific data critical to its submission.",
      "Authorized, not endorsed by the FDA",
      "Thursday's announcement is not an approval or endorsement, and the FDA reiterated that people who do not smoke should not use Juul or any other e-cigarettes. The FDA determination indicates that smokers who switch completely to Juul can reduce their exposure to deadly carcinogens and other chemicals found in traditional cigarettes.",
      "The FDA decision applies to Juul's original system, which is now roughly a decade old. Crosthwaite said the company hopes to win authorization for its next-generation device and is also considering applying to the FDA for more flavors.",
      "\"It's critically important that American adults who use tobacco have regulated options,\" Crosthwaite said.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has authorized a handful of e-cigarettes to help adult smokers cut back on cigarettes. Juul's main competitors, Vuse and Njoy, each previously received FDA permission to remain on the market. Njoy sells the only other menthol-flavored e-cigarettes authorized by the FDA.",
      "To meet FDA requirements, companies must show that their products benefit public health. In practice, that means proving that adult smokers who use them are likely to quit or reduce their smoking, while teens are unlikely to get hooked on them.",
      "Juul's journey, from launch to lawsuits",
      "The brainchild of two Stanford University students, Juul launched in 2015 and within two years rocketed to the top of the vaping market.",
      "Juul quickly outpaced older brands with its high-nicotine, fruity-flavored cartridges, sold in mango, mint and creme brul\u00e9e. The company's small, discrete devices provided a more potent, user-friendly alternative to older, bulkier devices.",
      "But the company's rise was fueled by underage use, and e-cigarettes quickly became ubiquitous in U.S. schools. In 2019, the company was pressured into halting all advertising and eliminating most of its flavors, leaving only tobacco and menthol-flavored options.",
      "By then, the company was already the target of multiple investigations and lawsuits by federal, state and local officials, as well as class-action attorneys.",
      "In 2022, the company paid $1.7 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits brought by families of Juul users, school districts, city governments and Native American tribes. The company separately agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle lawsuits or investigations from most U.S. states.",
      "Juul is no longer the top-selling e-cigarette brand and now trails Vuse, which is sold by tobacco giant Reynolds American, which also makes Camel and Newport cigarettes.",
      "Teens have shifted away from Juul amid a wider drop in vaping, according to the latest federal figures. The FDA reported last year that teen vaping dropped to a 10-year low, after stepped-up enforcement against unauthorized brands imported from China, such as Elf Bar.",
      "Unlike Juul, disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar still come in fruit and candy flavors, despite efforts by regulators to block their use.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 20:34:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested that changes might be coming to the rules limiting liquids in carry on-bags.",
    "story": [
      "Air travelers may soon see another change when passing through security checkpoints at airports, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggesting there may be changes to current TSA restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags.",
      "The potential change in policies around carrying liquids on flights comes after Noem on July 8 said passengers at airports no longer have to remove their shoes during regular TSA security checks. That change went into effect immediately.",
      "Speaking at a conference hosted Wednesday by publication The Hill, Noem said she's questioning \"everything TSA does\" and spoke of possible changes to the amount of liquids travelers can tote in their carry-on baggage. Under current TSA guidance, travelers can carry liquids in travel-sized containers of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item in their carry-on bag.",
      "\"The liquids, I'm questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be,\" Noem said. \"We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it's still as safe.\"",
      "She gave no details about precisely what those changes might be or how quickly travelers could expect to see them.",
      "Travelers generally must empty or throw away their water bottles before going through a TSA checkpoint, or else pack containers with more than 3.4 ounces of liquid in their checked baggage. There are exceptions for medications and baby formula.",
      "The TSA has been exploring the liquids issue for years, former TSA Administrator John Pistole told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave earlier this month. The TSA has been installing new computed tomography, or CT, checkpoint scanners at airports, which generates a 3-D image of a bag's content and which can automatically detect other potential security hazards.",
      "When were liquids restricted on planes?",
      "The rules for liquids on flights were a response to a 2006 incident in which authorities foiled a plot to used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage to blow up planes.",
      "Ever since the guidelines were adopted, TSA checkpoints have been the scene of travelers quickly guzzling water, digging through luggage to find and discard a too-large tube of hair gel, and chucking jars of everything from jam to coffee that didn't meet the size requirement.",
      "The regulations also triggered myriad discussions \u2014 sometimes arguments \u2014 over what constitutes a liquid. Yogurt? Peanut butter? Jam and jelly? All are currently restricted to containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces as detailed on an extensive list that TSA maintains on its website titled \"What can I bring?\"",
      "Noem also laid out her vision for the future of airport travel during the talk Wednesday.",
      "\"Hopefully, the future of an airport, where I'm looking to go is that you walk in the door with your carry-on suitcase, you walk through a scanner and go right to your plane,\" she said. \"It takes you one minute.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 19:39:03 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins are a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives on Thursday passed the bill regulating the digital currency .",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House by a 308-122 vote after it was passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The landmark legislation lays out the rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "House Republicans\u00a0announced\u00a0last week that July 14 would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. House lawmakers approved all three bills on Thursday which are now headed to President Trump's desk.",
      "Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 1.40% on Thursday, rising to $120,584.80; etherium's price rose 3.41% to $3,486.86.",
      "Shares of Coinbase, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, rose 3.2% on Thursday, to close at $410.75.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 19:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A top White House budget official said President Trump is \"troubled\" by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's management, as Mr. Trump pressures him over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law,\" a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a July 10 letter.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but it also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its yearslong office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter Thursday responding to Vought, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually.",
      "The Fed chair said the Fed generally isn't subject to the National Capital Planning Commission's approval, but it did work with the agency \"voluntarily\" in 2020 and 2021. Since then, Powell said, the central bank has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further review by the commission is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged\u00a0that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs,\" along with higher labor costs.",
      "On its website, the Fed says the two headquarters buildings that are getting overhauled \"have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s.\" The central bank said there are no private elevators or new VIP dining rooms \u2014 instead, the project will refurbish old elevators and conference rooms, including ones that are sometimes \"used for mealtime meetings.\" It also said plans for new water features were scrapped, though existing fountains will be repaired, and the garden terrace is actually a \"ground-level front lawn.\"",
      "On July 2, Bill Pulte, the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of \"deceptive\" testimony to the Senate about the office project.",
      "When asked about the allegation in a recent Cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump said: \"Then he [Powell] should resign immediately. We should get somebody in it that's going to lower interest rates.\"",

    "summary": "The GENIUS Act is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate cryptocurrency after its fate appeared in limbo when right-wing Republicans staged a rebellion that brought the floor to a standstill.",
      "The bill, known as the\u00a0GENIUS Act, is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress. It now heads to President Trump's desk.",
      "It passed in a bipartisan vote of 308 to 122, with 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats supporting it.",
      "On Tuesday, a dozen conservatives sank a procedural vote to advance three crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for\u00a0stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, abruptly canceled the remaining floor votes and the holdouts went to the White House to meet Mr. Trump, who later announced that they \"have all agreed\" to fall in line.",
      "But drama unfolded during Wednesday's procedural vote when a few holdouts initially voted against moving forward before dropping their opposition, which was short-lived. The next procedural vote to set up debate on the spate of bills was held open for nearly 10 hours as the holdouts sought to merge a broader market structure bill with legislation to ban a central bank digital currency.",
      "Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said holdouts had made a deal with Mr. Trump to package the two digital asset measures.",
      "The plan ran into opposition from those who wrote the legislation and upended what House Republicans had termed \"crypto week.\"",
      "House Republicans had originally wanted the GENIUS Act to be married with the CLARITY Act, a broader bill that would set rules for when a digital asset is considered a commodity or security. Combining the crypto bills would have sent the legislation back to the Senate and slowed the process. Mr. Trump had pressed Congress to quickly pass the GENIUS Act as a standalone bill, saying it would make the U.S. a leader in digital assets.",
      "This week, conservatives pushed to tie the CLARITY Act with the controversial Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Conservatives said the Senate's stablecoin bill and the broader market structure legislation were insufficient because it would allow for a central bank digital currency, which they opposed.",
      "\"We feel like we need to be dealing with all this at once,\" said Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who helped stall the bill.",
      "A deal was ultimately made late Wednesday to\u00a0tie the ban on a central bank digital currency with the must-pass annual defense reauthorization bill, and holdouts again flipped their votes to allow the legislative process to move on.",
      "The Senate\u00a0approved the bipartisan stablecoin bill last month after experiencing hiccups caused by a Democratic revolt over concerns about the Trump family's business ventures involving crypto and the potential that they could make the president vulnerable to foreign influence.",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth by billions\u00a0of dollars in recent months as the administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The White House has denied that there are any conflicts of interest and said Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust managed by his children.",
      "Democratic critics were also worried that the legislation did not contain strong enough provisions to protect consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "It's faced similar criticism from House Democrats.",
      "\"By passing this bill, Congress will be telling the world that Congress is OK with corruption, OK with foreign companies buying influence,\" Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said Thursday.",
      "Democrats who back the legislation have argued that regulations are long overdue, even if the measure is imperfect.",
      "\"The question is, do you want some rules of the road or no rules of the road?\" Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey said during floor debate.",
      "The broader market structure bill also passed with bipartisan support and now heads to the Senate. The legislation banning a central bank digital currency was approved largely along party lines.",

      "The F&G survey provides a snapshot into the thinking of Gen X, ages 45 to 60, whose oldest members are now entering their pre-retirement years. The\u00a0average retirement age\u00a0in the United States is 62, which is also the earliest age at which people can start claiming Social Security benefits.",

The full retirement age for people born in 1960 or later is 67, at which point workers can receive their full benefits. Those who delay claiming until age 70, however, can get another 24% boost to their monthly checks.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 14:46:47 -0400",
    "summary": "New legal documents are renewing interest in how Jeffrey Epstein's former net worth and how he amassed his fortune. Here's how he made his money.",
    "story": [
      "Newly released legal documents are renewing the focus on Jeffrey Epstein, with public scrutiny of the court papers reigniting interest in the late sex offender's\u00a0wealth and how he amassed it.",
      "Accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls before dying by suicide in a federal prison in 2019, the politically connected multimillionaire never graduated from college, but still wound up socializing with a range of major public figures, from former U.S. presidents and software moguls to members of the British royal family.",
      "The grandson of Jewish immigrants, Epstein was raised in Brooklyn, where he excelled in math and graduated from high school early, briefly attending Cooper Union and New York University, according to published reports over the years by multiple news outlets, some citing court documents.",
      "The roughly 60 documents released as of Thursday mostly mention names already known. In fact, the judge who made the call last month to release the information said she was doing so largely because much of it was already public.",
      "Still, the plan to make the papers public fueled rumors that they contained a list of clients or co-conspirators, and misinformation about their content continues to run rampant on social media, the Associated Press reported.",
      "The controversy over Epstein's death has also proved politically sensitive\u00a0after President Trump returned to office in January of 2025.",
      "What was Jeffrey Epstein's net worth?",
      "At the time when the disgraced financier was found dead at 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in August of 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, a filing in his criminal case pegged\u00a0his net worth at roughly $560 million. Epstein's assets also included a number of lavish properties.",
      "Epstein owned a palatial townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan worth more than $50 million. He also owned a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, worth about $12 million; a ranch in New Mexico valued at just over $17 million; and an apartment in Paris worth an estimated $8.6 million.",
      "His two private Caribbean islands \u2014 Great St. James and Little St. James \u2014 were together valued at $86 million following his death, but purchased for $60 million in 2023 by billionaire Stephen Deckoff, founder of alternative investment firm Black Diamond Capital Management. Epstein also owned a private jet.",
      "What did Jeffrey Epstein do for a living?",
      "While in his early 20s, Epstein in 1974 started teaching math at The Dalton School, one of New York's most prestigious prep schools, and left in 1976, with an administrator\u00a0telling\u00a0the New York Times he'd dismissed Epstein for poor performance.",
      "But the stint at Dalton had him tutoring the son of Bear Stearns CEO Alan Greenberg, which led to a job at the investment bank before it collapsed in 2008 following the housing crash. Epstein then became a money manager for billionaires including Les Wexner, founder and CEO of L Brands, and Apollo Global Management Chairman Leon Black. Black paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning services, according to the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "A law firm retained by Apollo's board to review Black's dealings with Epstein cleared Black, who stepped down as chairman and CEO of the private equity firm in 2021, of any possible wrongdoing.",
      "Black in July of 2023 agreed to pay $62.5 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands to be released from any potential claims arising from the territory's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The four-page settlement stipulated that it didn't constitute an \"admission of liability\" by Black, according to the New York Times.",
      "For more than a decade, Epstein was\u00a0Wexner's personal money manager\u00a0and business adviser, making hundreds of millions of dollars managing Wexner's billions.",
      "\"Epstein's crimes are abhorrent, and we applaud every effort to bring justice to those harmed,\" L Brands told CBS MoneyWatch in 2019.",
      "Wexner said in an email to employees at the time that he regretted he ever \"crossed paths\" with Epstein. \"When Mr. Epstein was my personal money manager, he was involved in many aspects of my financial life,\" the email stated. \"But let me assure you that I was NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment.\"",
      "Where else did Epstein get his money?",
      "JPMorgan Chase loaned Epstein money and regularly let him withdraw large sums of cash from 1998 through August 2013, according to a class-action lawsuit settled by the nation's largest bank last year. Payouts are expected to be made to nearly 200 women.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch in June of 2023, JPMorgan called Epstein's behavior \"monstrous,\" and said it regretted any association with the disgraced financier.",
      "Epstein also had financial dealings with Deutsche Bank, which in May 2023 agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the German bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking and profited from doing business with him.",
      "Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the settlement. In 2020, it acknowledged its \"error of onboarding Epstein in 2013 and the weaknesses in our processes.\"",
      "For how much did he buy his islands?",
      "Epstein owned two neighboring islands. He paid $7.95 million in 1998 for the 75-acre Little St. James, according to the New York Post and New York Magazine. In 2016, Epstein paid more than $20 million for the 165-acre Great St. James, according to CNBC and the Wall Street Journal.",

According to the Themed Entertainment Association, Disneyland drew more than 17 million people in 2023, bouncing back from an unprecedented 13-month closure during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The park was built on what was once orange groves in Anaheim, just outside Los Angeles. It opened on July 17, 1955 \u2014 a year that also saw Ray Kroc start his first McDonald's restaurant and Jim Henson introduce his original version of Kermit the Frog.",
      "Disneyland's first day was famously a disaster, all broadcast on a live television special. The park opened just a year after its groundbreaking and simply wasn't ready for its big day.",
      "Attractions broke down, there weren't enough restrooms, food and drinks were in short supply, traffic backed up for miles and the shoes of the first guests sank into freshly paved asphalt.",
      "Among the original rides still around today are the Mad Tea Party, Peter Pan's Flight and Jungle Cruise.",
      "The cost to get in that first year was $1 for adults and 50 cents for children, although tickets for most rides were an additional 10 to 50 cents.",
      "Today, a one-day ticket starts at more than $100 and on some days can double that.",
      "Over the years, the park has hosted U.S. presidents, kings and queens, and countless celebrities.

      "The resort in Anaheim now includes Disney California Adventure and Downtown Disney, a shopping and entertainment district.",

In 2019, the park unveiled Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, an attraction that transports visitors to the Star Wars universe, with \"movie-accurate starships, fan-favorite characters roaming the land and an immersive audioscape, world,\" according to the Disneyland Resort website.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 11:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump threatens to raise tariffs, claiming the European Union won't buy U.S. cars or food \u2014 but 2024 trade data shows otherwise.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and European Union have just weeks to reach a new trade deal before President Trump plans to impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the 27 EU member countries starting Aug. 1.",
      "The EU negotiates trade policy as a single entity and was the U.S.'s top goods trading partner in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In 2024, the U.S. imported around $606 billion in goods from the EU and exported around $370 billion worth of products to it.",
      "EU leaders have warned they're prepared to impose higher tariffs on hundreds of U.S. imports unless a deal can be reached in the coming weeks. Economists say the dispute could drive up consumer prices on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended tariffs as necessary to protect American workers, pointing to the trade imbalance on goods and higher EU tariffs as evidence the bloc has treated the U.S unfairly for years.",
      "The president has also repeatedly said the European Union does not buy American cars or agricultural products. However, trade data from 2024 shows that's inaccurate. While the U.S. has imported more cars and agricultural products from Europe in recent years than it exports there, the EU remains a significant market for these American products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the data.",
      "EU is the U.S.'s fourth largest buyer of agricultural products",
      "President Trump has repeatedly suggested Europe does not buy agricultural goods from U.S. farmers and producers.",
      "\"The European Union is, in many ways, nastier than China, OK?,\" President Trump said at an event May 12. \"They sell us their agricultural products. We sell them virtually none. They don't take our products.\"",
      "But according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of American agricultural products in 2024, purchasing a record $12.8 billion in these goods. Top exports to the EU included oilseeds like sunflower and sesame seeds, nuts and processed nut products like peanut butter, and soybeans.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. imported $36 billion in agricultural products from the EU in 2024 \u2014 buying billions of dollars worth of European wine, animal products, and grains and feeds.",
      "The White House has not responded to a request for clarification on the president's claim.",
      "Before Mr. Trump raised tariffs to a baseline of 10% in April, the EU maintained a higher average tariff on foreign agricultural products than the United States. In 2023, the EU average tariff on foreign agricultural goods was 10.8%, compared to the U.S. rate of 5%.",
      "Certain American food products are also less available in Europe because of consumer preferences and regulations, as the EU bans some American food products that contain certain additives they have deemed unsafe for human consumption.",
      "EU buys more than 160,000 American vehicles each year",
      "Another frequent target of President Trump's criticism is the EU's trade imbalance on cars.",
      "\"They sell us 13 million cars. We sell them none,\" Mr. Trump claimed at an event in May.",
      "It is true that the United States imports far more European vehicles than the number of American-made vehicles it exports to the EU, but the EU does buy some American cars.",
      "In 2024, the EU imported about 165,000 American vehicles, valued at roughly $8.8 billion at current exchange rates, according to a report by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. By comparison, the same data shows the U.S. imported about 750,000 vehicles from the EU in 2024, worth $43 billion.",
      "A post shared by CBS News Confirmed (@cbsnewsconfirmed)",
      "Both trading partners have long imposed tariffs on foreign vehicles. The EU charges a 10% tariff on U.S. passenger cars, while the U.S. charged 2.5% on EU passenger cars until Mr. Trump raised the tariff on all foreign vehicles to 25%. The U.S. has also maintained a 25% tariff on EU pickup trucks since the 1960s.",
      "Apart from tariffs, industry analysts say U.S. cars are less competitive in the EU market for a number of other reasons, including that the member nations tend to have higher fuel economy standards, higher gas costs, and their buyers tend to prefer smaller cars.",
      "Other major products include pharmaceuticals and crude oil",
      "Though Mr. Trump often focuses on cars, they're not the biggest sector. Biological products and medication are actually the top commodities the U.S. imports from the EU, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This is driven partly by some American pharmaceutical companies maintaining manufacturing facilities in EU countries with lower corporate tax rates like Ireland.",
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has floated tariff rates as high as 200% on foreign-made pharmaceuticals unless companies onshore manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "On the export side, the top U.S. exports to the EU include oil and natural gas, airplanes, and immunological products like blood plasma.",
      "Over the weekend, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU still hopes to reach a new agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding, \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",

      "Asked Wednesday if he wants Powell investigated for fraud related to the renovations of the Fed headquarters, Mr. Trump said, \"Well, I think he's already under investigation. He spent far more money than he was supposed to rebuilding.\"",
      "\"I think he's, you know, he's got some problems,\" Mr. Trump said. He added there are \"many people\" who want the chair role.",
      "Russ Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, sent a letter last week to Powell accusing him of an \"ostentatious\" yearslong office renovation project that may be \"violating the law.\" In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\"",
      "Sources inside the administration told CBS News the president has been socializing the possibility of a for-cause firing in public and private remarks, but the White House has not yet formally built a legal predicate.",
      "The Trump administration has tried to increase the pressure on Powell, with some administration officials publicly accusing the Fed of mismanaging a multibillion-dollar project to renovate its Washington headquarters \u2014 an allegation Powell has pushed back on.",
      "For decades, Federal Reserve leaders have operated with a high degree of independence from the rest of the government, allowing them to make decisions about the nation's monetary policy with little input from politicians.",
      "Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, one of the Republicans who voted against advancing the crypto legislation, wrote in an X post Tuesday night, \"Hearing Jerome Powell is getting fired! From a very serious source.\"",
      "In a later post, she wrote, \"I'm 99% sure firing is imminent.\"",
      "Several lawmakers in the Oval meeting declined to comment, saying the discussion was private. White House spokespeople didn't immediately comment.",
      "Some members of the House Financial Services Committee were planning to meet with Powell on Wednesday night, sources told CBS News. Some members want to reinforce the independence of his role, one of the sources said.",
      "But a spokesperson for the committee's chairman, Rep. French Hill, said the meeting was canceled due to uncertainty with vote timing in the House. Hill said the meeting had been scheduled months ago to introduce freshman members of the committee to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump's dissatisfaction with Powell, and his view that the Federal Reserve is not acting quickly enough to cut interest rates, has been a frequent topic of discussion for the president in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has nicknamed Powell \u2014 who was first elevated to the role of Fed chair by Mr. Trump \u2014 \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "\"I think he's terrible,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday. \"You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a \u2014 nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality.\"",
      "\"I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in,\" he said, referring to the building renovation.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump insisted he wouldn't force Powell out, though he has called on Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The fake news is saying, 'Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad, it would be so bad.' I don't know why it would be so bad, but I'm not going to fire him,\" the president said June 12.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out against the Fed for leaving interest rates steady so far this year after cutting rates last year. Further rate cuts could boost economic growth and make it easier for Americans to borrow money, but at the risk of causing inflation to spike.",
      "Interest rates remain near a two-decade high, after the Fed hiked rates in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has dropped significantly since then, but it remains above the Fed's 2%-per-year target, and Powell has indicated he plans to move cautiously. Powell has also said the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to worsen.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates. He has criticized Powell in increasingly sharp terms, calling him a \"Total and Complete Moron\" and a \"numbskull\" in a Truth Social post last month.",
      "Powell was initially picked as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first administration, and former President Joe Biden nominated him for a second four-year term in 2022.",
      "A firing would immediately spark a legal challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court recently indicated they don't think Mr. Trump has the authority to do so. The justices in May ruled Mr. Trump can fire members of independent federal agencies including the National Labor Relations Board, but said its decision did not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve because it is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",

    "summary": "Americans are starting back-to-school shopping earlier this year out of concern over tariffs, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "The back-to-school season may seem at least a month away on the calendar, but for a majority of American families, it's already begun.",
      "Two-thirds of back-to-school shoppers have already started buying clothing and supplies ahead of the new school year \u2014 a 55% increase on the level of early purchases last year.",
      "That's according to a new\u00a0survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF), which indicates that students and their parents are getting an early start on shopping this year, hunting for deals as they navigate\u00a0economic uncertainty. More than half of consumers surveyed, 51%, cited concerns over tariffs as the reason why they were starting school shopping earlier this year.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "The price of school supplies and books has already reached an all-time high, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis\u00a0shows. However, consumers worry that the cost of items could go up even more once the full brunt of President Trump's tariffs take effect.",
      "Mr. Trump recently announced on Truth Social that he would\u00a0place steep tariffs\u00a0on over 20 countries, starting on Aug. 1. The levies could directly impact the cost of apparel and other\u00a0back-to-school items\u00a0like electronics that are imported from abroad.",
      "In its report, the NRF predicts families will spend a total of $128.2 billion on supplies this year, up from $125.4 billion last year. The increase, however, reflects an increase in the number of consumers shopping for back-to-school supplies, and not individual spending, which is expected to be lower this year.",
      "Families with students in kindergarten through high school plan to spend an average of $858.07 on school-related items this year, down from $874.68 in 2024, according to the study. College students and their parents also plan to spend less this year \u2014 an average of $1,325.85, down from $1,364.75 in 2024.",
      "Four in five shoppers said they were planning their shopping around July back-to-school sales to maximize their budgets, the NRF report found.",
      "Retailers focus on sales",
      "With inflation and tariffs top of mind for many consumers, stores are already promoting back-to-school discounts to lure shoppers.",
      "\"As shoppers look for the best deals on clothes, notebooks and other school-related items, retailers are highly focused on affordability and making the shopping experience as seamless as possible,\" NRF's Cullen said.",
      "Amazon, Target and Walmart\u00a0are each offering back-to-school summer sales to entice customers. Amazon last week completed its four-day Prime Day event, which offered thousands of\u00a0deals on everything from backpacks to dorm furnishings to laptops.",
      "Walmart on Tuesday\u00a0announced\u00a0lower prices on 14 of the most popular back-to-school supplies compared with last year. A survey by the retail giant found that 70% of its customers said they planned to spend more time this year searching for discounts.",
      "\"Regardless of income, families want to ensure their students are set up for success,\" said Phil Rist, executive vice president of strategy at analytics firm Prosper, said in a statement. \"They are cutting back in other areas, using buy now, pay later or buying used or refurbished items to have everything they need for the school year.\"",

The final price was $5,296,000, which includes the hammer price, premiums and local taxes, according to the auction house. Sotheby's has not publicly identified the buyer.",
      "Pieces of Mars found on Earth are rare. According to the auction house, just 400 of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth \u2014 or about 0.6% \u2014 are from Mars. The meteorite represents approximately 6.5% of all Martian material currently known on Earth.",
      "Meteorites come from meteors, space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but the ones that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere are considered meteorites. The chunk of Martian rock that was auctioned off by Sotheby's was likely dislodged from the planet by an asteroid strike.",
      "NWA 16788 traveled 140 million miles through space before it crashed in the Sahara Desert, where it was found in Niger's remote Agadez Region in 2023, according to Sotheby's.",

      "The meteorite weighs just over 54 pounds, which makes it the largest meteorite from Mars, but not the largest meteorite ever found. According to NASA, a meteorite originally weighing over 100 tons once fell to Namibia.",
      "It's believed that NWA 16788 is a \"relative newcomer here on Earth, having fallen from outer space rather recently,\" Sotheby's said in its auction listing. The meteorite was on public view at Sotheby's New York galleries ahead of the auction on Wednesday.",
      "\"This isn't just a miraculous find, but a massive dataset that can help us unlock the secrets of our neighbor, the red planet,\" Hatton said in the auction house video.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is set to sign a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, one day after the bill passed the House despite some opposition from conservatives.",
      "The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, will be the first major law governing digital currency, establishing a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency, since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.",
      "The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed.",
      "Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what they dubbed \"Crypto Week\" in Congress. The\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump is scheduled to sign the GENIUS Act in a ceremony at the White House at 2:30 p.m. ET.",
      "The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week.",
      "Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.",
      "\"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED\u2026.BUT NO MORE,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. \"THIS IS BIG!!!\"",
      "Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act takes place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has\u00a0faced increasing pressure\u00a0to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" the president wrote on\u00a0Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",

      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",
      "Bondi wrote in a post on X minutes later, \"we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\"",
      "A judge will need to make the final decision on whether material can be released, which could take some time and is unlikely to be immediate.",
      "It's unclear what material the Trump administration will ask to be released. It's not clear how much of the Epstein-related material in the government's possession is grand jury testimony.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges, and he was later charged with child sex trafficking in Manhattan in 2019. The government also secured a conviction against Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. It investigated the circumstances of Epstein's death in federal custody, which was deemed a suicide.",
      "The order from Mr. Trump comes after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that Epstein did not have an incriminating \"client list,\" did not try to blackmail any prominent figures, and died by suicide. The memo drew backlash from across the political spectrum, including from some fervent Trump backers, in part because Bondi and other administration figures had promised to release information on Epstein.",
      "The government is generally required to keep grand jury materials secret, and it's common for not all material that is shown to a grand jury \u2014 which meets before a person is criminally indicted \u2014 to emerge during a criminal case.",
      "A request of this kind by the government is unusual, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner, and a former federal prosecutor.",
      "\"I've been in and around federal criminal cases for over 30 years. I've never heard of this before,\" he told CBS News.",
      "While the scope of the government's request is still unknown, Epner says it could encompass an \"enormous quantity of data.\" Mr. Trump said the government would seek the release of grand jury testimony, which Epner noted may include exhibits that witnesses testified about before a grand jury.",
      "\"I would not bet against there being anything, from the most interesting thing in the world to the least interesting thing in the world, in that material,\" said Epner, who told CBS News he believes calls for more information to be disclosed in the Epstein case are warranted.",
      "Epner joked: \"If we were to find out the location of the corpse of Jimmy Hoffa, I would not be surprised.\"",
      "Material likely will not be released immediately, according to Epner, who said, \"weeks would be moving very quickly, months is likely.\" Under court rules, grand jury material is typically only released under certain circumstances, often when it's needed for some other investigation. The government's grounds for release in this case aren't clear.",
      "In this case, both associates and alleged victims of Epstein's may oppose some disclosures.",
      "\"I would not be surprised if a number of people came forward under pseudonyms to object to the release of grand jury material related to them,\" Epner said. \"I also would not be surprised if some of the victims\u2026came forward and said, 'Yes, we do want things to be revealed.'\"",
      "Trump administration faces Epstein fallout",
      "Last week's memo on Epstein reignited years of questions \u2014 and conspiracy theories \u2014 on the disgraced financier, including speculation about the circumstances of Epstein's death in custody, and about whether the federal government was concealing information to shield some of Epstein's famous friends.",
      "Bondi had pledged to release files related to Epstein, and suggested in a Fox News interview in February a \"client list\" was \"sitting on my desk right now to review.\" (She later said she meant generally that material on Epstein was sitting on her desk.)",
      "In late February, the Justice Department distributed binders to over a dozen right-wing social media influencers labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1,\" though the influencers later said many of the materials were already in the public domain.",
      "Some Republicans and vocal Trump supporters were dissatisfied with last week's memo, in some cases calling for more disclosures or the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the Epstein case \u2014 which White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president does not support.",
      "Mr. Trump, for his part, has scolded some Republicans for buying into what he called the \"the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,\" calling them \"stupid people\" and \"weaklings\" who are \"do[ing] the Democrats work.\"",
      "Shortly before pushing for the release of grand jury testimony, the president on Thursday denied a Wall Street Journal report on what the newspaper described as a \"bawdy\" birthday letter to Epstein \u2014 featuring a drawing of a nude woman \u2014 that the paper claimed was signed by Mr. Trump in the early 2000s. Mr. Trump and Epstein had crossed paths for years, though Mr. Trump says they had a \"falling out.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 06:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has said he wants a \"simple redrawing\" of Texas' congressional map where Republicans pick up five seats.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Texas Legislature is set to convene Monday for a special session where it will attempt to redraw the state's congressional map to boost President Trump and his allies' efforts to maintain the GOP's grip on the U.S. House in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The state's decision to recraft the boundaries of House districts comes midway through the decade and several years after its GOP-controlled Legislature adopted a redistricting plan in the wake of the 2020 Census.",
      "Under that plan, Republicans hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats control 12. (The death of Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, has left one seat open.)",
      "But with Republicans holding a razor-thin majority in the House, and the risk the GOP could lose control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, a reshaping of the congressional districts could give Mr. Trump's party an edge heading into next year's elections.",
      "Mr. Trump's political team had been pushing Texas GOP leaders to look into redrawing the state's congressional map, The New York Times reported last month. Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed the Legislature would undertake the effort, among 17 other agenda items, when it meets.",
      "\"I don't think this has anything to do with Texas \u2014 this has to do with Trump,\" said Joshua Blank, the research director of the Texas Politics Project. \"This has nothing to do with the internal dynamics of the state, the political trajectory of the state. This is purely about this election cycle and one person's benefit.\"",
      "How did we get here?",
      "States undergo the redistricting process after every 10-year census, when voting lines are redrawn to account for population changes. After the 2020 Census, Texas crafted a new congressional map to include two new districts, bringing its total number of House seats to 38.",
      "The maps drawn by the GOP-led Texas Legislature aimed to protect Republican seats in Congress and the statehouse. Democrats flipped two congressional districts and 12 state House seats in the 2018 midterms.",
      "\"In 2021, they spent a lot of time and effort making sure they had the best maps possible with the primary goal to ensure that the Republican majority was rock solid,\" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University. \"And they created 24 of 38 districts where there is no way, shape or form that a Republican is losing those districts, absent some type of murder indictment or a serial adulterer, etc.\"",
      "But the final version of the congressional map was met with criticism, and it has been challenged in court. Among the issues raised by voting rights groups is that 95% of Texas' growth has been driven by non-White voters, but the map crafted in 2021 created more majority-White districts.",
      "A three-judge panel in El Paso is currently considering a consolidated challenge to the map brought by voting rights groups, Latino voters and lawmakers. The plaintiffs argue that the new lines violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. A trial ended in June.",
      "Texas has a part-time Legislature, which meets for 140 days every two years. The governor has the power to call special sessions to cover specific topics, and the special sessions constitutionally cannot last longer than 30 days. The governor can, however, call as many special sessions as he deems necessary. After the 88th legislative session in 2023, Abbott called four special sessions that stretched into December.",
      "Redistricting is one of 18 topics that Abbott has asked the Legislature to address. Four of those topics include disaster relief for the Central Texas floods and improving the state's warning system.",
      "\"I'm not convinced that the goal is to pass everything, but ultimately, Abbott gets the credit for trying, and the Legislature will get the credit for what it can accomplish, but it'll also get the blame for what it fails to do,\" Blank said.",
      "Although the Democrats could leave the state to deny Republicans a quorum, like they did in 2021 to protest a voting bill, it's unlikely they would do so if it meant holding up flood relief.",
      "Where does Trump and his administration come into play?",
      "Texas has conducted two congressional elections under the 2021 map. But earlier this month, the Justice Department sent Abbott a letter alleging that some of the districts were racial gerrymanders that violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.",
      "Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, specifically pinpointed four districts \u2014 the 9th, 18th, 29th and 33rd \u2014 that she said constitute \"coalition districts\" that should be redrawn. All three are currently represented by Democrats, and Turner, who died in March, represented the fourth.",
      "Coalition districts are those that bring two or more racial minorities together to make up a majority of the population, and where voters from these groups vote together to elect their preferred candidate.",
      "In her letter, Dhillon wrote that the state had to \"immediately\" rectify the alleged racial gerrymanders, and if it chose not to, it was at risk of legal action by the attorney general.",
      "\"The congressional districts at issue are nothing more than vestiges of an unconstitutional racially based gerrymandering past, which must be abandoned, and must now be corrected by Texas,\" she wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump appears to be on board with the recrafting of Texas' voting boundaries. Before leaving the White House on Tuesday, the president said he is looking for a \"simple redrawing\" where Republicans pick up five seats.",
      "\"Texas would be the biggest one,\" he said.",
      "But during the trial in the case involving the congressional map, state officials repeatedly said they were motivated not by race when they drew the district lines, but instead driven by politics. State Sen. Joan Huffman, a Republican who led the 2021 Senate Redistricting Committee, testified that the congressional map was \"drawn blind to race\" and \"racial data was not considered at all during the drawing of the maps,\" according to court records.",
      "\"There is no legal justification for doing this. It sort of walks and talks and quacks like a political move,\" said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. \"The problem is that it's really difficult to get more seats in Texas without heavily undermining the political power of communities of color.\"",
      "In claims of racial gerrymandering, those challenging a map have to show that race predominated for how the lines were drawn.",
      "\"This can't be a racial gerrymander if they didn't consider race,\" Li said. \"This is a textbook, easy it's-not-a-racial-gerrymander. \u2026 If you didn't consider race, it can't be a racial gerrymander.\"",
      "Has Texas drawn new maps in the middle of the decade before?",
      "A divided Texas Legislature drew up a congressional map in 2001, but two years later, in a plan engineered by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, Republicans wanted to redraw the lines to make the most of the growing GOP majority in the state.",
      "Fifty-one Democrats in the state House fled to Oklahoma for four days, denying the Republicans the quorum they needed to bring the redistricting plan to the floor and letting the clock run out on the regular session. Then-Gov. Rick Perry called the Legislature back for a special session, but state Senate Democrats left the state to deny a quorum.",
      "Although the Democrats remained out of state for more than a month, they couldn't stop the maps from eventually passing, and Republicans ultimately picked up five seats. The Supreme Court upheld the congressional districts in 2018.",
      "But former Democratic Rep. Mark Strama, who ran for office after that round of redistricting, warned the effort did have some downsides for Republicans. The drama was covered nationally, and Strama himself flipped a Central Texas district in 2005.",
      "\"Voters were mad at both sides,\" Strama said. \"They hate all these political shenanigans. But there's no question voters hate this.\"",
      "While Texas has redrawn the lines of congressional districts in the middle of a decade before, Li said the current situation is far from normal.",
      "\"Outside of litigation, it is extremely rare,\" he said. \"And it's exceptionally rare \u2014 in fact, I can't think of another circumstance, where a party drew the map, and then that same party redrew the map. Where there are mid-decade redistrictings, it's usually because political control changes hands.\"",
      "Could this plan backfire?",
      "While Democrats have not won statewide office in Texas since 1994, the best year Democrats have had at the ballot in the past two decades was in 2018. In that midterm election, former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke came within three points of GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and Democrats flipped two congressional seats and 12 state House seats.",
      "Republicans have managed to quell those gains and, as Jones noted, the 2024 election was a high point for the party. But the dynamics of the 2026 election could mirror those in 2018, when Democrats ran aggressive campaigns targeting Mr. Trump and retook the House. Any changes to the congressional map might not be enough to stem Democratic gains this time around.",
      "\"If Republicans do engage, do go all out and try with the goal of flipping, say three, four, even five seats as President Trump says \u2014 it's far more likely Republicans see a net loss than a net gain,\" Jones said.",
      "Plus, any map adopted by the GOP-led Legislature and approved by Abbott is likely to be swiftly met with lawsuits. If a federal court blocks its use, the new district lines may not even be in place for the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"President Trump is talking about five more seats out of Texas, and the only way you get five more seats out of Texas is if you seriously undermine the political power and the political voice of communities of color,\" Li said. \"And that is a Texas-sized lawsuit with potentially huge ramifications.\"",
      "Li said the redrawing of political bounds to give Republicans a leg up in the 2026 midterm elections is not only a legally risky move, but could be politically perilous too.",
      "\"The essence of trying to get more seats is that you have to spread your voters out more if you're a Republican,\" he said. \"So you have a bunch more districts that you're not winning by 65 or 70%. You're going to have a bunch of districts that you're winning by 52, 53% and in a state that is changing as fast as Texas, that's growing as fast as Texas, that's changing demographically as fast as Texas. By 2030, these districts could look and perform very differently.\"",
      "The 2020 Census showed that people of color accounted for 95% of Texas' population growth over the prior decade. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau released last year also showed that the number of Asian Americans in Texas grew by nearly 92,000 people, while there were more than 91,000 new Black residents in the state.",
      "\"When you gerrymander, you're making a bet that you know what the politics of the future will look like,\" Li said. \"There are many places where you can safely bet on what the politics of the future will look like in the country. Texas is not one of those places. It's just changing too fast.\"",
      "Republicans have made big gains in South Texas' Rio Grande Valley, once considered a Democratic stronghold. But even with those GOP gains \u2014 and running on the maps drawn in 2021\u00a0 \u2014 two of the three seats remained Democratic in 2024.",
      "\"People talk about the Rio Grande Valley as if it's somehow indicative of Texas,\" said Blank of the Texas Politics Project. \"It's less than 3.5% of the total statewide vote, and it's incredibly economically depressed and it's overwhelmingly Hispanic. It's not really indicative of any part of the state, it's indicative of its region of the country that happens to share a border with Mexico.\"",
      "What can Democrats do?",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the states have lambasted Republicans for pushing to redraw congressional district lines to hold onto power in the House.",
      "\"Elected officials should earn the support of voters they hope to represent,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Tuesday. \"Republicans want a country where politicians choose their voters, not the other way around. It reeks of desperation, and we're going to do everything that we can in Texas and beyond to respond.\"",
      "Jeffries said the reason for the special session in Texas is to \"try to steal the midterm elections by rigging\" the state's congressional map.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, has suggested that Democrats mount their own partisan gerrymander. California has 52 congressional districts, and Democrats represent 43 of them.",
      "\"There are *currently* 9 Republicans in the California Congressional Delegation. Just thought folks might like to know that fun fact,\" he wrote on X\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "During an appearance on the podcast \"Pod Save America,\" Newsom accused Republicans of trying to \"rig the game\" because they're concerned about maintaining control of the House next year.",
      "California voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2010 that handed over the task of crafting congressional and state legislative districts to an independent commission. But Newsom suggested there are still two paths that could lead to a new congressional map: calling a special session of the California Legislature to put a measure on the ballot for a special election that would clear the way for new House district lines; or having the state Legislature create a new map under the idea that it's coming mid-decade and not after the census.",
      "\"It ups the stakes of the redistricting war, with the acknowledgment that Democrats have a limited hand to play,\" Li said of Texas' decision to draw new congressional lines.",
      "Just 15 states have Democratic trifectas, where they control the state legislature and the governorship. Two of those states, Colorado and Michigan, leave the drawing of political voting lines to independent commissions like California does. Republicans are in full control in 23 states.",
      "Plus, in other states where Democrats control the legislature and governor's mansions, the congressional delegations already heavily skew Democratic. In Illinois, for example, Democrats hold 14 of its 17 House seats. Maryland's eight-member congressional delegation contains just one Republican.",

      "The bill targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID.

      "Before the floor vote, the package had to get through the House Rules Committee, where there was heated debate on Democrats' demands for a vote on an Epstein-related measure. All but one Republican on the committee voted against similar amendments when they were first presented earlier this week, further fueling criticism from those who want documents on Epstein released.",
      "The controversy has divided Mr. Trump's base since his administration\u00a0released a memo earlier this month saying that Epstein had no \"client list\" and died by suicide in 2019.

      "As the committee debated the release of the files, Mr. Trump announced that he asked Attorney General Pam Bondi \"to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval.\" The request came after the Wall Street Journal published a letter Mr. Trump allegedly wrote to Epstein for his birthday in 2003, which the president called \"fake.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would not say Thursday afternoon whether he planned to delay a final vote past the deadline by exercising his right under House rules to speak for as long as he'd like, a power he used to make a record-breaking speech earlier this month.",

    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of firing Jerome Powell \u2014 whom he first appointed Federal Reserve chair \u2014 earlier this week, after years of on-and-off criticism over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump asked about the idea of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a meeting with lawmakers this week, CBS News has reported, a legally untested move that follows years of on-and-off criticism of the Fed leader leveled by Mr. Trump.",
      "The president's gripes with his handpicked Fed chair \u2014 whom he has called a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule\" \u2014 have largely focused on the central bank's decision to keep interest rates relatively high so far this year, part of an inflation-fighting campaign. Mr. Trump has also taken aim at Powell's handling of a Federal Reserve office renovation project.",
      "Mr. Trump asked a group of House Republicans if he should fire Powell during a Tuesday night Oval Office meeting, sources told CBS News earlier this week. The president told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he'll fire Powell, though he confirmed he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him,\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Who is Jerome Powell, and who appointed him?",
      "Powell is the chair of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first term, replacing Obama appointee Janet Yellen, and the Senate confirmed him in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "\"He's strong, he's committed, he's smart,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech announcing his decision to nominate Powell in 2017, praising Powell's reputation as a \"consensus-builder.\"",
      "Last month, though, Mr. Trump said he initially nominated Powell because he \"listened to someone that I shouldn't have listened to, and Biden shouldn't have reappointed him.\"",
      "Before becoming chair, Powell had served on the central bank's Board of Governors since 2012, when he was initially nominated by former President Barack Obama.",
      "Powell has switched between government and private-sector jobs for much of his career. He worked in investment banking in the 1980s and 1990s, interrupted by a stint as former President George H.W. Bush's undersecretary of the Treasury. For almost 20 years starting in the 1990s, he was a partner at the Carlyle Group investment firm, according to his Fed biography.",
      "A Georgetown-educated lawyer, Powell does not have a Ph.D. in economics, unlike some other former Fed chairs.",
      "Does Jerome Powell have a designated term length?",
      "Federal Reserve chairs serve for four-year terms, so Powell's stint as chair will end in May 2026.",
      "Members of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors, however, serve for 14 years, and Powell's term as a board member ends in January 2028. Yellen resigned from the board after her term as Fed chair ended, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has encouraged Powell to follow suit, though Powell's plans are unclear.",
      "The chair and board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "What does the Federal Reserve do?",
      "The Federal Reserve is the United States' central bank. Made up of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks and a D.C.-based Board of Governors, its responsibilities include regulating the U.S. banking system, serving as a \"lender of last resort\" to banks and running an instant payment system.",
      "But one of the Federal Reserve's highest-profile responsibilities is its role in setting monetary policy. Through its 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which includes Powell, the Fed works independently of elected officials to influence the supply of money in the U.S. economy and the interest rates at which it's lent out, with an eye toward keeping unemployment low and prices stable.",
      "Those two goals \u2014 maximizing employment and minimizing inflation \u2014 are known as the Fed's \"dual mandate.\" But they're in conflict with each other. If the Fed lowers interest rates, it can boost economic growth, but it also runs the risk of overheating the economy and pushing up inflation. And if interest rates are hiked, inflation tends to cool off, but the economy slows down.",
      "The interest rate that the Fed targets is called the Federal Funds Rate, which is what banks charge to lend money to each other overnight. But other interest rates \u2014 from mortgage rates to yields for U.S. government bonds \u2014 tend to follow closely with the Federal Funds Rate, so the Fed's decisions impact borrowing costs for average American consumers and businesses.",
      "Picking the right balance isn't easy, and the Fed often faces criticism for its choices.",
      "Under Powell, the Fed dropped its target interest rate to near 0% at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with the goal of averting an economic catastrophe. But after the economy recovered and inflation soared, the central bank in 2023 hiked interest rates to their highest point in decades, aiming to get inflation under control. The Fed has taken a cautious path since then, cutting rates slightly last year as inflation fell but keeping them steady so far this year.",
      "Last month, the Fed's rate-setting committee said it may cut rates later this year, but there are concerns that inflation \u2014 which is still above the Fed's 2%-per-year target \u2014 could worsen. Powell has also suggested the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could increase inflation.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said last month.",
      "Why is Trump unhappy with the Fed and Jerome Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump is unhappy with the Fed's decision to leave rates stable. For months, the president has pushed the central bank to slash rates immediately, calling Powell \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "The president argued last month that inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates.",
      "\"If he was concerned about Inflation or anything else, then all he has to do is bring the Rate down, so we can benefit on Interest Costs, and raise it in the future when and if these 'other elements' happen (which I doubt they will!),\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He's not the first president to criticize the Fed for high interest rates, which make everything from car loans to mortgages more expensive and can put a damper on the economic growth that tends to make or break presidents' popularity. But Mr. Trump has been unusually vocal.",
      "In a mid-June post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called Powell a \"Total and Complete Moron\" and urged the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to \"override\" him. While Powell is just one of 12 votes on the committee, the chair traditionally has an outsize role in its decisions. The last few decisions to leave interest rates stable have been unanimous.",
      "Mr. Trump had similar issues with Powell during his first term, saying during an earlier interest rate-hiking campaign in 2018 that he was \"not even a little bit happy with my selection\" of Powell. When the Fed cut rates in 2020, Mr. Trump called Powell his \"most improved player.\"",
      "Meanwhile, members of the Trump administration have pressured Powell over a yearslong renovation to the Fed's headquarters complex. In a letter to the central banker, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought called some of the features \"ostentatious,\" and alleged that Powell may have misled Congress about the project's scope or made changes to the plans without getting permission from the right federal bodies.",
      "Mr. Trump has also criticized Powell over the renovations. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he's \"highly unlikely\" to fire Powell \"unless he has to leave for fraud.\" At other points, Mr. Trump has suggested Powell should resign over the project.",
      "Powell said last year he would not resign as chair if asked to do so.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter to Vought and denied allegations that it was overly lavish, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually. Powell added the Fed has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further government review is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a high degree of independence over its own budget, and legally has the power to buy and remodel office spaces in Washington, D.C., as it sees fit.",
      "Is the Fed independent from the rest of the government? And can Trump fire Powell?",
      "The structure of the Fed \u2014 with board members and chairs who serve across multiple administrations \u2014 allows it to make decisions without direct input from politicians.",
      "Whether the president can fire Powell before his term ends is legally untested. Federal law says members of the Federal Reserve board can only be removed by the president before their terms end \"for cause,\" and the Supreme Court found in 1935 that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court did allow Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards, but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell before his term ends could also roil financial markets, analysts and lawmakers from both parties have warned. Mr. Trump acknowledged this risk Wednesday, telling Just The News in an interview, \"They say it would disrupt the market if I did.\"",
      "At some points in the Federal Reserve's 112-year history, including during World War II, the central bank has been more beholden to the needs of the Treasury. But the Fed has operated more independently since 1951, when a public disagreement between the Fed and the Truman administration led the Treasury to agree to let the central bank set interest rates on its own.",
      "There's nothing preventing the president from publicly expressing his views about the Fed, though, as several of Mr. Trump's predecessors have. During his campaign last year, Mr. Trump said he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "\"In my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve, or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in an August 2024 press briefing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in April that Mr. Trump \"has the right to express his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\"",

      "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi took a tour of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay Thursday morning as part of President Trump's directive to revert the popular tourist attraction to a federal penitentiary.",
      "Bondi toured Alcatraz, currently part of the National Park Service, along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, arriving on a Coast Guard vessel. They were joined by a contingent of administration officials and Secret Service staffers who walked in the chilly bay air among the crumbling buildings, many dating back to the late 19th century.",
      "The attorney general was seen posing for pictures in front of Alcatraz signs and vista points on the island. Later, Bondi and Burgum posted images of their tour on the X social media platform.",

      "Trump administration's push to reopen Alcatraz",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Justice told CBS News that Bondi and Burgum were visiting Alcatraz to receive a briefing on the facility and the surrounding island. They were also directing staff to collaborate on the necessary planning to rehabilitate and reopen the facility, the spokesperson said.",
      "In an interview on Fox News, Bondi spoke about Alcatraz's potential to once again hold prisoners.",
      "\"Alcatraz could hold the worst of the worst. It could hold middle-class violent prisoners, it could hold illegal aliens, it could hold anything,\" said Bondi. \"This is a terrific facility, needs a lot of work, but no one has been known to escape from Alcatraz and survive.\"",
      "In May, Mr. Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he was directing the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and Homeland Security to \"reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.\"",
      "Following the announcement, Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III said in a statement that his agency would \"vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President's agenda\" and that he ordered \"an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps.\"",
      "Alcatraz's history as federal penitentiary",
      "The former Army fortress and military prison was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and housed the country's most infamous criminals, such as Al Capone and \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. However, most of the inmates were not notorious gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules of other federal institutions.",
      "The prison was said to be escape-proof because of the strong bay currents and cold waters surrounding it. The Bureau of Prisons says\u00a0of the 36 men involved in 14 separate escape attempts, 23 were caught, 6 were shot and killed during their escape, and 2 drowned, leaving five others as either successfully escaped or presumed drowned.",
      "The penitentiary was closed in 1963 due to the high operating costs and deteriorating facilities. In 1972, Alcatraz was designated part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area\u00a0under the National Park Service, and the following year it opened to the public as a historic site and tourist attraction. The site\u00a0has undergone multiple restoration efforts to improve visitor facilities and preserve historic structures and natural habitats around the island.",
      "Alcatraz a money-maker for federal government, San Francisco",
      "Alcatraz currently receives about 1.6 million visitors from around the world every year, according to the Park Service. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi lambasted the Trump administration's plans\u00a0to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, which would put an end to the approximately $60 million in annual revenue that tourism brings to the National Park Service and the city.",
      "\"With stiff competition, the planned announcement to reopen Alcatraz as a federal penitentiary is the Trump Administration's stupidest initiative yet,\" said Pelosi in a prepared statement. \"It should concern us all that clearly the only intellectual resources the Administration has drawn upon for this foolish notion are decades-old fictional Hollywood movies.\"",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie had no plans to meet with either Bondi or Burgum, according to his office. He issued a statement criticizing the Trump administration's plans for Alcatraz.",
      "\"There's no realistic plan to make Alcatraz reopen as anything other than the wonderful tourist attraction that it currently is,\" Lurie said. \"If the federal government wants to spend billions of dollars, I want them to spend it on clean and safe streets and San Francisco's economic recovery. Alcatraz draws millions of visitors a year, tens of millions of dollars in economic activity, and that is benefiting San Francisco's recovery. We're on the rise and that's what I'm focused on.\"",
      "It's estimated that reopening Alcatraz as a prison would cost hundreds of millions of dollars upfront and up to $100 million a year in operating costs. When the penitentiary was closed in 1963, the annual operating costs were more than three times that of any other federal prison, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 20:32:49 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, a top Justice Department official, to serve as a federal circuit judge.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, President Trump's former defense lawyer and a top Justice Department official, to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit.",
      "The GOP-led panel voted 12-0 to favorably report Bove's nomination to the full Senate, surmounting a key hurdle amid staunch opposition from a host of former federal prosecutors and judges, as well as allegations of unethical conduct by a Justice Department whistleblower.",
      "But as Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley called Bove's nomination for the vote, Democrats erupted in protest because not all were allowed to speak. Grassley also refused to consider a motion by Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, to delay consideration of Bove's nomination and allow the whistleblower, Erez Reuveni, to testify before senators.",
      "All Democratic members of the committee then left the meeting. Grassley and Republicans continued to tick through nominations, including Bove's, while Booker criticized his GOP colleagues before joining his fellow Democrats in walking out.",
      "\"This lacks decency. It lacks decorum. It shows that you do not simply want to hear from your colleagues. It is absolutely wrong,\" Booker said, accusing Republicans of trying to rush Bove's nomination through the committee.",
      "At the start of the hearing, Grassley accused his Democratic colleagues of \"unfair rhetoric and treatment\" of Bove.",
      "\"Mr. Bove has a strong legal background and has served his country honorably. He deserves fair treatment,\" Grassley said. \"The vicious partisan attacks and obstruction of nominees that we've seen from Democrats this Congress has to stop. One day, roles will reverse again, and my colleagues will want the same fairness for nominees of their president that they refuse to extend to President Trump's nominees.\"",
      "But Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the panel, said Bove shouldn't be seriously considered by the upper chamber for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.",
      "\"He led this administration's embarrassing efforts to strike a corrupt bargain with New York City Mayor Eric Adams and he's been trailed by a history of complaints long predating his affiliation with President Trump about his temperament, poor judgment and lack of candor before the court,\" Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said.",
      "Bove's path to winning approval from the Judiciary Committee became easier earlier this week, when Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told reporters that he was inclined to back his nomination. But it's less clear whether he will be confirmed by the full Senate. Republicans hold 53 seats in the upper chamber, meaning the nomination would fail if Bove loses the support of four GOP senators.",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May that he had selected Bove to fill a vacancy on the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit, which covers Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Bove was part of the legal team that represented the president in his criminal cases, including the New York hush-money trial and the two federal cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "After Mr. Trump won a second term, he selected Bove to serve as principal associate deputy attorney general. Bove also worked as the acting deputy attorney general while Todd Blanche, the current deputy, awaited confirmation by the Senate.",
      "Bove has been embroiled in controversy since joining the Justice Department. He was accused of pushing a quid pro quo in which the Justice Department would drop its prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for commitments on immigration. Several prosecutors resigned in the wake of the move regarding Adams' case.",
      "Bove defended the decision to drop the charges against Adams, telling senators in a questionnaire to the Judiciary Committee that it was \"well within the scope of prosecutorial discretion.\" He also argued that Adams' submissions to the court \"refute false public allegations by third parties regarding some sort of improper quid pro quo.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Reuveni, a former Justice Department attorney who handled immigration cases, filed a whistleblower claim with the Senate that accused Bove of suggesting that the administration ignore court orders. Reuveni worked for more than a decade at the Justice Department and was most recently the acting deputy director of its Office of Immigration Litigation.",
      "He was fired in April after he told a federal judge that the administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador had been an administrative error. A top immigration official with the administration had acknowledged in a March court filing that Abrego Garcia's removal was an \"error\" and an \"oversight.\"",
      "Reuveni wrote in his report that during one meeting about Mr. Trump's proclamation invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act, Bove said that the Justice Department would need to consider telling the courts \"f**k you\" if a judicial order blocked removals under the law.",
      "Emails and text messages shared with the Senate by the whistleblower include exchanges between Reuveni and a colleague at the Justice Department in which they appear to be referring to Bove's alleged directive regarding court orders.",
      "But Grassley said the documents were not enough to delay the vote on Bove's nomination, and he accused Democrats of mischaracterizing them.",
      "\"Government lawyers aggressively litigating and interpreting court orders isn't misconduct. It's what lawyers do all the time,\" the Iowa Republican said.",
      "But Durbin said senators could have questioned Reuveni about his claims themselves, since he volunteered to appear before the Judiciary panel.",
      "\"If you question the veracity of Mr. Reuveni, he's ready to stand before you, raise his right hand, take an oath and testify under oath. What more can you ask about credibility than that?\" he said.",
      "Booker attempted to have the committee vote on a motion to delay the vote on Bove's nomination and allow Reuveni to testify before senators, but Grassley said the proposal wasn't on the agenda.",
      "\"There's no need to rush this. What are you afraid of?\" Booker said.",
      "The Justice Department has defended Bove and sought to paint Reuveni as a \"disgruntled former employee.\" Blanche said the claims about Bove and other top Justice Department officials are \"utterly false.\"",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields has also praised Bove as an \"incredibly talented legal mind and a staunch defender of the U.S. Constitution who will make an excellent circuit court judge.\"",
      "During his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee in June, Bove denied Reuveni's allegations that he urged department attorneys to violate a court order.",

      "The president's physician, Sean Barbabella, said in a memo that the president underwent a thorough health examination after he noticed mild swelling in his legs, and it revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read the memo at Thursday's press briefing, and the White House later released it.",
      "According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs struggle to bring blood back up to the heart. Barbarella said the president, who is 79, remains in \"excellent\"\u00a0overall health.",

Barbarella said there was \"no evidence\" of blood clots or arterial disease.",
      "The president underwent multiple tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, Barbabella said.",

    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins are a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives on Thursday passed the bill regulating the digital currency .",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House by a 308-122 vote after it was passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The landmark legislation lays out the rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "House Republicans\u00a0announced\u00a0last week that July 14 would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. House lawmakers approved all three bills on Thursday which are now headed to President Trump's desk.",
      "Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",

    "summary": "A top White House budget official said President Trump is \"troubled\" by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's management, as Mr. Trump pressures him over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law,\" a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a July 10 letter.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but it also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its yearslong office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter Thursday responding to Vought, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually.",
      "The Fed chair said the Fed generally isn't subject to the National Capital Planning Commission's approval, but it did work with the agency \"voluntarily\" in 2020 and 2021. Since then, Powell said, the central bank has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further review by the commission is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged\u00a0that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs,\" along with higher labor costs.",
      "On its website, the Fed says the two headquarters buildings that are getting overhauled \"have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s.\" The central bank said there are no private elevators or new VIP dining rooms \u2014 instead, the project will refurbish old elevators and conference rooms, including ones that are sometimes \"used for mealtime meetings.\" It also said plans for new water features were scrapped, though existing fountains will be repaired, and the garden terrace is actually a \"ground-level front lawn.\"",
      "On July 2, Bill Pulte, the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of \"deceptive\" testimony to the Senate about the office project.",
      "When asked about the allegation in a recent Cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump said: \"Then he [Powell] should resign immediately. We should get somebody in it that's going to lower interest rates.\"",

    "summary": "States allege the Trump administration illegally ended FEMA's BRIC program, halting billions in disaster mitigation funding and putting storm-prone communities at risk.",
    "story": [
      "A group of 20 states sued the Trump administration on Wednesday seeking to block what they say was an illegal termination of a program that provided federal funding for natural disaster mitigation projects.",
      "\"By unilaterally shutting down FEMA's flagship pre-disaster mitigation program, Defendants have acted unlawfully and violated core separation of power principles,\" the lawsuit alleges, arguing that the executive branch doesn't have the authority to shut down the program funded by Congress.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, targets Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator David Richardson for their role in shutting down FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, also known as BRIC, program earlier this year. The lawsuit argues the power to make such a decision falls to Congress.",
      "Before it was halted in April, the BRIC program helped fund local infrastructure projects like stormwater control systems and relocating or elevating buildings in flood-prone areas.",
      "\"Projects that have been in development for years, and in which communities have invested millions of dollars for planning, permitting, and environmental review are now threatened,\" the lawsuit states. \"And in the meantime, Americans across the country face a higher risk of harm from natural disasters.\"",
      "A CBS News investigation last month revealed that the recent BRIC funding cuts have disproportionately affected counties that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election. Two-thirds of the counties losing funding voted for Mr. Trump. The elimination of the BRIC program will especially deprive vulnerable communities across the Southeast, the CBS News data analysis found.",
      "The lawsuit calls the impact of the BRIC program's shutdown \"devastating\" and says it will force communities across the country to delay, scale back or cancel hundreds of mitigation projects because of their inability to access their already-approved federal dollars.",
      "Alongside the lawsuit, the states also filed a request for a preliminary injunction asking the court to temporarily block the federal government from reallocating FEMA funds designated for disaster preparedness, arguing states will suffer irreversible damage if the funds are spent before the court rules.",
      "In an April press release announcing the cuts, which has since been removed from the FEMA website, the disaster response agency said the BRIC program was \"wasteful\" and had become more concerned with \"political agendas than helping Americans recover from natural disasters.\"",
      "The multibillion-dollar BRIC program was established in 2018 under the first Trump administration.",
      "\"Resiliency is a priority for DHS, but over the last four years the Biden Administration used the BRIC program as a piggy bank for its green new deal agenda,\" a FEMA spokesperson told CBS News on Thursday. \"We will make sure we do right by the taxpayers by bringing integrity to all our spending. If these States take issue with that, we will see them in court.\"",
      "The states suing are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Most have Democratic state leadership and have filed other lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions. North Carolina was ravaged by mudslides and flash flooding last fall after Hurricane Helene made landfall in late September.",
      "The lawsuit comes as FEMA in recent weeks has faced scrutiny about its response to floods in Texas that killed more than 130 people, including at least 37 children. It also comes just days after heavy rains and flooding inundated communities in states ranging from New York and New Jersey to New Mexico.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate cryptocurrency after its fate appeared in limbo when right-wing Republicans staged a rebellion that brought the floor to a standstill.",
      "The bill, known as the\u00a0GENIUS Act, is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress. It now heads to President Trump's desk.",
      "It passed in a bipartisan vote of 308 to 122, with 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats supporting it.",
      "On Tuesday, a dozen conservatives sank a procedural vote to advance three crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for\u00a0stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, abruptly canceled the remaining floor votes and the holdouts went to the White House to meet Mr. Trump, who later announced that they \"have all agreed\" to fall in line.",
      "But drama unfolded during Wednesday's procedural vote when a few holdouts initially voted against moving forward before dropping their opposition, which was short-lived. The next procedural vote to set up debate on the spate of bills was held open for nearly 10 hours as the holdouts sought to merge a broader market structure bill with legislation to ban a central bank digital currency.",
      "Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said holdouts had made a deal with Mr. Trump to package the two digital asset measures.",
      "The plan ran into opposition from those who wrote the legislation and upended what House Republicans had termed \"crypto week.\"",
      "House Republicans had originally wanted the GENIUS Act to be married with the CLARITY Act, a broader bill that would set rules for when a digital asset is considered a commodity or security. Combining the crypto bills would have sent the legislation back to the Senate and slowed the process. Mr. Trump had pressed Congress to quickly pass the GENIUS Act as a standalone bill, saying it would make the U.S. a leader in digital assets.",
      "This week, conservatives pushed to tie the CLARITY Act with the controversial Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Conservatives said the Senate's stablecoin bill and the broader market structure legislation were insufficient because it would allow for a central bank digital currency, which they opposed.",
      "\"We feel like we need to be dealing with all this at once,\" said Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who helped stall the bill.",
      "A deal was ultimately made late Wednesday to\u00a0tie the ban on a central bank digital currency with the must-pass annual defense reauthorization bill, and holdouts again flipped their votes to allow the legislative process to move on.",
      "The Senate\u00a0approved the bipartisan stablecoin bill last month after experiencing hiccups caused by a Democratic revolt over concerns about the Trump family's business ventures involving crypto and the potential that they could make the president vulnerable to foreign influence.",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth by billions\u00a0of dollars in recent months as the administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole.

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 15:25:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Three Democratic lawmakers have proposed legislation to classify extreme heat as a disaster, which would allow federal funding for extreme heat.",
    "story": [
      "There have been 27 major disaster declarations issued by President Trump so far in 2025. The disasters range in size and scope, from the L.A. wildfires to Midwest tornadoes and the Texas flooding as well as several winter storms. Many of them have resulted in fatalities and billions of dollars in damage to property and businesses, but one major deadly weather event that occurred in June hasn't been declared: an extreme heat wave.",
      "Between June 20-24, a heat dome, or the presence of high heat over a region that lingers for an extended period of time, exposed nearly half of the country to dangerously high temperatures. On June 24, seven states tied or broke monthly high temperature records, many exceeding triple digits. One of those states, Maryland, reported that 472 people needed medical assistance for heat-related illnesses during that time when the heat index topped 110 degrees in some places. But there's no disaster declaration for the event listed on the FEMA website.",
      "That's because extreme heat is not considered a \"disaster\" that is eligible for federal funding, according to the Stafford Act, which is the guiding law that outlines when and how the president can declare disasters and direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide assistance to state and local governments.",
      "Now, three Democratic lawmakers are attempting to change that. Senators Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Ruben Gallego of Arizona, along with Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia of Texas, have proposed legislation to classify extreme heat as a disaster, which would allow federal funding to flow into areas where hotter temperatures cause significant physical and economic distress. Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York has signed on as a co-sponsor.",
      "\"Last year, more than 500 people died in one single county in Nevada from heat-related illnesses,\" Rosen said in a statement. \"Current federal policy ignores the physical and health risks that such extremely high temperatures have on our communities, which is why I'm introducing a bill to change that. By classifying extreme heat as a major disaster, our communities will be able to receive the federal funding needed to respond and prepare for future extreme heat events.\"",
      "It's not the first time Rosen has proposed the legislation. She introduced a similar bill in 2024 that passed through the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee rather quickly, before being blocked by a Senate Republican.",
      "Under the Stafford Act, there are 16 types of natural disasters listed, defined as \"any hurricane, tornado, storm, flood, high water, winddriven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, drought, fire, or other catastrophe in any part of the United States which causes, or which may cause, substantial damage or injury to civilian property or persons.\" It does not explicitly list extreme heat.",
      "In a statement, Gallego said that more Americans are killed by extreme heat than any other form of extreme weather incident combined, according to the National Weather Service. \u00a0\"By adding extreme heat to FEMA's list of major disasters, we can unlock the funds and support our communities desperately need,\" he added.",
      "According to Rosen's office, declaring extreme heat a major disaster would enable states and local governments to request federal funds that could provide additional cooling centers, air conditioning to communities that need it, money for water infrastructure projects, as well as a mechanism where communities can request money for heat adaptation projects, such as planting more trees, or building shade structures to reduce urban heat.",
      "But there are some who do not agree that adding extreme heat to the Stafford Act is necessary.",
      "\"It is already eligible under the Stafford Act,\" says Deanne Criswell, the former FEMA administrator under President Biden, \"There's nothing that excludes a governor from requesting a declaration for extreme heat.\"",
      "There have been at least three previous times when a governor requested a major disaster declaration for extreme heat: in 1980 by the governor of Missouri; in 1995, when the Illinois governor requested it over a heat wave that killed more than 700 people; and most recently in 2022, when California Gov. Gavin Newsom requested a major disaster declaration for a heat dome and resulting wildfires. In all instances, the requests were denied at the time by the sitting president.",
      "According to Criswell, the Stafford Act is designed to pay for impacts to infrastructure caused by a natural disaster, but the majority of resources a state might need for extreme heat \u2014 like cooling centers, tree shade, and air conditioning \u2014 are things that can be addressed ahead of an extreme heat event through existing hazard mitigation grants.",
      "\"What damaged infrastructure do you have from an extreme heat situation?\" Criswell told CBS News, \"You might have power issues, but is it damaged or is it just a temporary situation because of the overload on it?\"",
      "While Criswell doesn't see the need for extreme heat to be added to the Stafford Act to qualify for disaster funding, she does believe there needs to be a greater emphasis on supporting hazard mitigation projects and funding, which have been subject to cuts under the Trump administration.",
      "\"This administration has not been granting the hazard mitigation grant programing to these disaster declarations,\" says Criswell. The reasoning behind that, she says, is because much of the mitigation money that was given in previous disaster declarations hasn't been utilized.",
      "The White House has not commented on extreme heat being added as a disaster risk, and President Trump has focused on overhauling FEMA and shifting disaster response and recovery to states.",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recently concluded a series of public hearings as it debates whether to institute the first federal rule to protect indoor and outdoor workers from heat, which would mandate employers provide paid breaks, water and shade.",
      "The rule has faced criticism from business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which says the rule would \"impose unreasonable burdens.\" Business groups have backed efforts in some Republican-led states, like Florida and Texas, to block local municipalities from passing heat protection rules for workers.",
      "Despite the pushback, seven states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorado, Minnesota and Maryland \u2014 have adopted independent heat protection rules for workers, but significant federal legislation to address extreme heat, both in the workplace and for disaster declarations, remains an uphill battle for Democrats.",

      "Mr. Trump has defended tariffs as necessary to protect American workers, pointing to the trade imbalance on goods and higher EU tariffs as evidence the bloc has treated the U.S unfairly for years.",
      "The president has also repeatedly said the European Union does not buy American cars or agricultural products. However, trade data from 2024 shows that's inaccurate. While the U.S. has imported more cars and agricultural products from Europe in recent years than it exports there, the EU remains a significant market for these American products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the data.",
      "EU is the U.S.'s fourth largest buyer of agricultural products",
      "President Trump has repeatedly suggested Europe does not buy agricultural goods from U.S. farmers and producers.",
      "\"The European Union is, in many ways, nastier than China, OK?,\" President Trump said at an event May 12. \"They sell us their agricultural products. We sell them virtually none. They don't take our products.\"",
      "But according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of American agricultural products in 2024, purchasing a record $12.8 billion in these goods. Top exports to the EU included oilseeds like sunflower and sesame seeds, nuts and processed nut products like peanut butter, and soybeans.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. imported $36 billion in agricultural products from the EU in 2024 \u2014 buying billions of dollars worth of European wine, animal products, and grains and feeds.",
      "The White House has not responded to a request for clarification on the president's claim.",
      "Before Mr. Trump raised tariffs to a baseline of 10% in April, the EU maintained a higher average tariff on foreign agricultural products than the United States. In 2023, the EU average tariff on foreign agricultural goods was 10.8%, compared to the U.S. rate of 5%.",
      "Certain American food products are also less available in Europe because of consumer preferences and regulations, as the EU bans some American food products that contain certain additives they have deemed unsafe for human consumption.",
      "EU buys more than 160,000 American vehicles each year",
      "Another frequent target of President Trump's criticism is the EU's trade imbalance on cars.",
      "\"They sell us 13 million cars. We sell them none,\" Mr. Trump claimed at an event in May.",
      "It is true that the United States imports far more European vehicles than the number of American-made vehicles it exports to the EU, but the EU does buy some American cars.",
      "In 2024, the EU imported about 165,000 American vehicles, valued at roughly $8.8 billion at current exchange rates, according to a report by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. By comparison, the same data shows the U.S. imported about 750,000 vehicles from the EU in 2024, worth $43 billion.",
      "A post shared by CBS News Confirmed (@cbsnewsconfirmed)",
      "Both trading partners have long imposed tariffs on foreign vehicles. The EU charges a 10% tariff on U.S. passenger cars, while the U.S. charged 2.5% on EU passenger cars until Mr. Trump raised the tariff on all foreign vehicles to 25%. The U.S. has also maintained a 25% tariff on EU pickup trucks since the 1960s.",
      "Apart from tariffs, industry analysts say U.S. cars are less competitive in the EU market for a number of other reasons, including that the member nations tend to have higher fuel economy standards, higher gas costs, and their buyers tend to prefer smaller cars.",
      "Other major products include pharmaceuticals and crude oil",
      "Though Mr. Trump often focuses on cars, they're not the biggest sector. Biological products and medication are actually the top commodities the U.S. imports from the EU, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This is driven partly by some American pharmaceutical companies maintaining manufacturing facilities in EU countries with lower corporate tax rates like Ireland.",
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has floated tariff rates as high as 200% on foreign-made pharmaceuticals unless companies onshore manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "On the export side, the top U.S. exports to the EU include oil and natural gas, airplanes, and immunological products like blood plasma.",
      "Over the weekend, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU still hopes to reach a new agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding, \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",

    "summary": "The voting age in the U.K. will drop from 18 to 16 by the next national election in a bid to increase democratic participation, the government says.",
    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 Britain will lower the voting age from 18 to 16 by the next national election as part of measures to increase democratic participation, the government announced Thursday. The center-left Labour Party pledged before it was elected in July 2024 to lower the voting age for elections to Britain's Parliament. Scotland and Wales already let 16- and 17-year-olds vote in local and regional elections.",
      "Britain will join a short list of countries where the voting age is 16, including Austria, Brazil and Ecuador. A handful of European Union countries, including Belgium, Germany and Malta, allow 16-year-olds to vote in elections to the European Parliament, but not their national legislatures.",
      "The move comes alongside wider reforms that include tightening campaign finance rules to stop shell companies with unclear ownership from donating to political parties. Democracy Minister Rushanara Ali said the change would strengthen safeguards against foreign interference in British politics. There will also be tougher sentences for people convicted of intimidating political candidates.",
      "Additionally, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government said it will introduce automatic voter registration and allow voters to use bank cards as a form of identification at polling stations.",
      "The previous Conservative government introduced a requirement for voters to show photo identification in 2022, a measure it said would combat fraud. Critics argued it could disenfranchise millions of voters, particularly the young, the poor and members of ethnic minorities. The law ironically caught out the man who had helped to usher it onto the books, when former Prime Minister Boris Johnson was turned away from his local polling station last year after forgetting to bring his photo ID.",
      "Britain's elections watchdog agency, the Electoral Commission, estimates that about 750,000 people did not vote in last year's election because they lacked ID.",
      "Turnout in the 2024 election was 59.7%, the lowest level in more than two decades.",
      "Harry Quilter-Pinner, head of left-leaning think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the changes were \"the biggest reform to our electoral system since 1969,\" when the voting age was lowered to 18 from 21.",
      "The changes must be approved by Parliament, but Starmer's Labour Party currently holds an overwhelming majority of the seats, so it is likely to pass easily. The next national election must be held by 2029, but it could, theoretically, be called before that by the government.",
      "\"For too long, public trust in our democracy has been damaged and faith in our institutions has been allowed to decline,\" Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said. \"We are taking action to break down barriers to participation that will ensure more people have the opportunity to engage in U.K. democracy.\"",
      "Stuart Fox, a politics lecturer at the University of Exeter who has studied youth voting, said it's \"far from clear\" whether lowering the voting age actually increases youth engagement.",
      "\"It is right to help young people be heard,\" he said. \"But there are other measures which are more effective at getting young people to vote - particularly those from the poorest backgrounds who are by far the least likely to vote \u2014 such as beefing up the citizenship curriculum or expanding the provision of volunteering programs in schools.\"",

    "summary": "A majority of the people deported by ICE this year were convicted of traffic or immigration offenses, not violent crimes, according to data obtained by CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump campaigned on a vow to round up the \"worst of the worst\" offenders among the criminals who were living illegally inside the United States. But CBS News has obtained deportation data that indicates the Trump administration's deportation push has ensnared many undocumented immigrants without violent criminal records.",
      "Of the estimated 100,000 people who were deported between January 1 and June 24 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 70,583 were convicted criminals, according to an ICE document obtained by CBS News. However, the data also shows that most of the documented infractions were traffic or immigration offenses.",
      "The ICE document listed out raw data that was broken down by conviction, not by deportee.",
      "Only 1.8% or 2,355 of the total convictions against those criminals had to do with sex offenses. Another 1,628, or 1.2%, were for sexual assault. The number of homicide convictions totaled just 729, or 0.58%, and the number of convicted kidnappers were 536, or 0.42%. About 10,738 convictions were for assault, or 8.5%, the data showed.",
      "ICE's public messaging about its deportation push has focused on undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records, highlighting deportees who were convicted of murder, sex offenses and other violent crimes.",
      "Another stated goal of the Trump administration was to remove those with ties to criminal organizations. The CBS News-obtained document shows that 3,256 of the more than 100,000 people removed were known or suspected gang members or terrorists.",
      "In response to a CBS News inquiry, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said ICE has now deported about 140,000 undocumented immigrants since Mr. Trump took office. She also added that 70% of those arrested by ICE were of \"illegal aliens with criminal convictions or have pending criminal charges.\" McLaughlin declined to detail the nature of the convictions or criminal charges, or offer further specifics.",
      "Back on June 11, six Republican lawmakers who are members of the Congressional Hispanic Conference wrote to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons to urge the Trump administration to prioritize the detention of violent offenders, convicted criminals and national security threats. ICE has now responded to that inquiry for the first time with figures of those deported since Jan. 1.",
      "The Republicans who signed the letter include the conference's chair, Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas, along with Reps. Monica De La Cruz of Texas, Nicole Malliotakis of New York, David Valadao of California, Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida and Gabe Evans of Colorado.",
      "ICE arrests have soared since Mr. Trump took office, averaging 1,200 per day in the first three weeks of June, according to internal figures previously reported by CBS News. White House adviser Stephen Miller has pushed the agency to aim for 3,000 arrests per day, a more-than-twofold increase that has led to pressure on ICE leadership.",
      "An increasingly large share of people held in ICE deteintion do not have criminal records, CBS News has previously reported. Around 40% of the agency's detainees since Mr. Trump took office had criminal convictions of some kind with 8% of them convicted of violent crimes.",
      "Mr. Trump and top administration officials have said their focus is on arresting and deporting people with serious criminal records.",
      "\"The violent criminals in our country are the priority now,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters last month.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan says the administration's primary focus is on the \"worst\" offenders, but he has long said any undocumented immigrant could be subject to arrest.",
      "\"If you're in the country illegally, you are not off the table,\" Homan said at an event in Texas this week. \"We prioritize the worst, first. That makes sense. But it doesn't mean you prioritize this group and everybody else is good to go.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the ongoing controversy over his administration's handling of information related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is a \"Hoax\" and \"bulls***,\" criticizing members of his own party who are calling for more transparency as \"weaklings.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday morning, the president compared the uproar over the Justice Department's handling of the so-called Epstein files to past controversies, like the investigation into his 2016 campaign's possible ties to Russia and Hunter Biden's laptop.",
      "\"[T]hese Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at - It's all they have - They are no good at governing, no good at policy, and no good at picking winning candidates,\" he wrote. \"Also, unlike Republicans, they stick together like glue. Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'bullshit,' hook, line, and sinker.\"",
      "He continued: \"I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country's history, and all these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax. Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don't even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don't want their support anymore!\"",
      "In a meeting at the White House later in the morning, the president reiterated his statement, telling reporters \"they're wasting their time with a guy who obviously had some very serious problems, who died three, four years ago.\"",
      "\"I'd rather talk about the success we have with the economy, the best we've ever had, and all of the things we've done, including the Middle East. I mean, you see it. Instead, they want to talk about the Epstein hoax,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And the sad part is it's people that are really doing the Democrats' work. They're stupid people.\"",
      "On Thursday, a reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt if the president has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to appoint a special prosecutor in the Epstein case.",
      "\"The president would not recommend a special prosecutor in the Epstein case,\" Leavitt said. \"That's how he feels.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's statements highlight the deep divisions in his party over the handling of the Epstein case, including among some of his strongest supporters.",
      "The current controversy began last week, when the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review of the evidence against Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019. The department said the review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "The memo was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have long called for more transparency about the Epstein files, which they believe might implicate other powerful figures in Epstein's crimes.",
      "The review also exposed internal divisions within the administration itself. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Justice Department's handling of the case, and prominent conservatives have called for Bondi to be fired or resign over her decision to withhold any additional files. The president has defended Bondi's work on the case, telling reporters on Tuesday that she has \"handled it very well.\"",
      "Prominent Democrats have pressured their GOP colleagues to push for more transparency from the administration, so far unsuccessfully. Two procedural maneuvers in the House that would have required the administration to reveal more evidence about the Epstein case failed to overcome GOP opposition earlier this week.",
      "But Mr. Trump's supporters in conservative media and his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill are continuing to call for the administration to release more of what the government knows about the Epstein case. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Mr. Trump's closest congressional ally, told conservative podcast host Benny Johnson that he is \"for transparency\" in an interview on Tuesday.",
      "\"It's a very delicate subject, but you should put everything out there, let the people decide it,\" the speaker said. \"Pam Bondi needs to come forward and explain it to the American people. Let's get this thing resolved.\"",
      "Other Republicans have called on Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former partner who is serving a 20-year prison sentence on charges related to sex trafficking, to testify before Congress. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said that senators \"ought to call her in the Judiciary Committee, put it under oath and have her testify.\"",
      "The president has tried to tamp down the controversy within his party since last week, saying on Tuesday that the Epstein case is \"pretty boring stuff.\"",
      "\"I don't understand it, why they would be so interested. He's [been] dead for a long time, he was never a big factor in terms of life. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is,\" he told reporters. \"I really don't, and the credible information has been given.\"",

      "Can you teach an old dog new tricks? Atlantic staff writer Olga Khazan set out to change aspects of her personality she didn't like by forcing herself outside of her comfort zone, and documented the progress she made in her new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change\" (Simon & Schuster/Simon Element).",
      "Among the challenges that Khazan, a lifelong introvert, set for herself: Tackling her social anxiety by enrolling in an improv class. Yes, and \u2026 how did that go?",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Susan Spencer's interview with Olga Khazan on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

    "summary": "A groundbreaking IVF trial has raised hope that women with genetic mutations in their own DNA could one day have children without passing on deadly diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Eight healthy babies have been born in the U.K. using a new IVF technique that successfully reduced their risk of inheriting genetic diseases from their mothers, the people behind a world-first trial said Wednesday.",
      "The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting.",
      "In 2015, Britain became the first country to approve an in-vitro fertilization technique that uses a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the egg of a donor \u2014 along with the mother's egg and father's sperm.",
      "Some have called the result of this process \"three-parent babies,\" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor.",
      "The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy",
      "Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old.",
      "The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which causes disease \u2014   was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease.",
      "This indicates the technique was \"effective in reducing transmission\" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said.",
      "The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said.",
      "Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise.",
      "Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as \"reversal,\" which is still little understood.",
      "It is \"a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,\" he explained.",
      "Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\"",
      "The new technique offers a \"very important reproductive option\" for families affected by \"devastating\" mitochondrial diseases, he added.",
      "While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016, after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case.",
      "Ethical concerns over embryos and \"designer babies\"",
      "Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France.",
      "Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered \"designer babies.\"",
      "An ethical review carried out by the U.K.'s independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was \"instrumental\" in conducting the new research, the council's director Danielle Hamm said Wednesday.",
      "Peter Thompson, head of the U.K.'s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which approved the procedure, said only people with a \"very high risk\" of passing on a mitochondrial disease would be eligible for the treatment.",
      "Ethical concerns have also been raised over the use of mitochondrial donation for infertility in Greece and Ukraine.",
      "French mitochondrial disease specialist Julie Steffann told AFP that \"it is a question of the risk-benefit ratio: for a mitochondrial disease, the benefit is obvious.\"",
      "\"In the context of infertility, it has not been proven,\" she added.",

    "summary": "The site where the remains were found was once home to a beloved ice cream shop.",
    "story": [
      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

    "story": [
      "Miami \u2014 Marine scientists in Miami are hoping to restore Florida's coral reef by taking coral from Honduras and crossbreeding\u00a0it.",
      "Warming ocean waters have had a devastating impact on the coral reefs of the Sunshine State. Efforts are underway to save the third-largest barrier reef system in the world, including the use of\u00a0lab-grown corals and the\u00a0removal of healthy corals, but scientists are now trying a method that they say has never been done before.",
      "\"It's the first time ever in the world that an international cross of corals from different countries have been permitted for outplanting on wild reefs,\" Dr. Andrew Baker, a marine biologist at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel  School of Marine Science, told CBS News on a boat ride near Miami.",
      "There are dozens of stony coral species along Florida's 350 miles of reefs, from the Florida Keys up to the St. Lucie Inlet. Two of them are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, one of which is the Elkhorn coral.",
      "The Elkhorn species helps form the skeleton of a healthy reef, but according to Baker, more than 95% of the Elkhorn coral off Florida has been wiped out by a combination of factors, including rising temperatures fueled by climate change, increased coastal development and disease outbreaks",
      "\"Over the last 50 years or so, we've lost more of these Elkhorn corals, culminating in 2023 when we had this really warm summer,\" Baker said. \"And in order for that population to recover, it was determined that we need more diversity from outside the Florida population.\"",
      "So, scientists and conservationists started looking off the Caribbean coast in Honduras, specifically Tela Bay, where Elkhorn coral live in \"the kind of conditions where corals have to be really tough to survive,\" Baker said.",
      "To crossbreed the Elkhorns, scientists with Tela Marine, a Honduras-based aquarium and marine research center, carefully plucked coral from the reef in Honduras. Permits were then needed to transport the coral fragments into the U.S.",
      "Once they arrived in Florida, scientists with the University of Miami and the Florida Aquarium in Tampa worked to create the \"Flonduran\" Elkhorn, as it was nicknamed by Baker.",
      "Earlier this month, the crossbred species were planted for the first time in Florida, underneath protective umbrellas to deter predators.",
      "\"And if these corals can live through the next marine heat wave, then that is critical for our coastal protection on the coast of Florida,\" said Keri O'Neil, the director of coral conservation at the Florida Aquarium.",
      "With robust and healthy corals, South Florida's coastal communities are better protected from flooding because the reefs help break up hurricane-fueled waves. The planting of the first Flondurans is just the start of what's needed to rebuild.",
      "\"We need to now scale this up and be out planting hundreds of thousands of baby corals all throughout the reef,\" Baker said. \"And there are ways to do that, but we've got to gear up and get going.\"",

      "The Perseids meteor shower begins this week and is expected to offer one of the best shows in the sky of 2025.",
      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before dawn, in the Northern Hemisphere. Sometimes, however, the meteors can be seen at night as early as 10 p.m.",
      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",

    "summary": "Barbara Rae-Venter never anticipated that her genealogy hobby would lead to the capture of one of California's most notorious criminals, the Golden State Killer. Her pioneering use of genetic genealogy has since helped solve numerous cold cases.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Rae-Venter, a 76-year-old patent attorney living in Marina, California, thought she'd spend her retirement leisurely playing tennis, traveling, and indulging in her favorite pastime: researching her ancestry and building a family tree. It didn't quite work out that way. For Rae-Venter, something she started as a hobby led to capturing one of the most notorious criminals in California.",
      "Seven years ago, Rae-Venter, using her genetic research skills, tracked down a fugitive in California who had eluded capture for more than three decades, and remarkably, she did it without ever leaving her home.",
      "The fugitive was the Golden State Killer. In April 2018, the FBI and California law enforcement made headlines with a stunning announcement: \"We found the needle in the haystack, and it was right here in Sacramento.\"",
      "Since 1974, investigators had sought the man responsible for at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes in the state of California. But it wasn't until Rae-Venter joined the investigation that they learned his name: Joseph James DeAngelo. \"It's not that I'm so very special,\" said Rae-Venter. \"It's just I happened to be in the right place at the right time.\"",
      "Using DNA left by DeAngelo at a crime scene, Rae-Venter identified him by using a technique now known as investigative genetic genealogy. \"It's just basically doing the same as you would do if you're doing family history research, and augmenting that with DNA to make sure that the relatives that you find are really related to you,\" she said.",
      "Her crime-solving career began quite by accident. Rae-Venter, who also has a Ph.D. in biology, was volunteering as a search angel \u2013 a person who helps adoptees find their biological parents. \"It's such a fundamental desire,\" she said. \"They're just so focused. They just so want to know where they came from.\"",
      "A Living Jane Doe",
      "In 2015, Rae-Venter responded to an email sent by Peter Headley, then a veteran investigator with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, and fell into her first mystery. Headley was trying to uncover the true identity of a woman in her 30s who had been kidnapped as a child. \"She really wanted to know who she was,\" said Headley, referring to her as a living Jane Doe. \"She's alive, but we have no idea who she is,\" he said.",
      "That living \"Jane Doe\" went by the name of Lisa Jenson. At five years old, she had been abandoned at an RV park by a man called Gordon Jenson. \"It turned out she had been kidnapped by the suspect, and he just told everyone that he was her father,\" Headley said.",
      "Later, detectives learned that Gordon Jenson was just one of many aliases used by Terry Rasmussen, a notorious serial killer, who died in prison in 2010 without ever revealing who Lisa really was.",
      "Lisa Jenson did not know who her mother was, or if she had any sisters or brothers. Headley said that Lisa had heard about genetic genealogy and wondered if that could lead her to her real family: \"I said, 'Okay, let's try it.' So, opened an account for her, got her in Ancestry, and we had some distant matches, and I'm like, this might just work.\"",
      "But this was new territory for Headley, so he emailed DNA Adoption for help and found Barbara Rae-Venter. Asked why she agreed to collaborate, Rae-Venter replied, \"It was a puzzle!\"",
      "She began the laborious process of building family trees to find Lisa's real family, which involved more than just looking at DNA: \"The DNA is just the jump-off point. You're doing census records, you're doing birth, death and marriage records. My favorite is probably Facebook. I've actually built trees from the amount of stuff people have put in their Facebook pages.\"",
      "Headley helped by coaxing distant relatives to take DNA tests. \"People were skeptical, thought it was a scam,\" he said. \"One lady thought I was going to clone her.\"",
      "And DNA tests are expensive. Headley and Rae-Venter reached into their own pockets to help subsidize the costs.",
      "I asked, \"So, you're not only not getting paid to do this work, you're actually paying for these tests?\"",
      "\"We probably each spent a couple of thousand dollars on kits,\" Rae-Venter said.",
      "It took nearly a year, but in 2016, the DNA trail led to New Hampshire, and the case of a missing young mother, Denise Beaudin. She and her infant daughter had vanished from her home, along with a man named Bob Evans, which turned out to be yet another alias of that serial killer, Terry Rasmussen",
      "Investigators believe Rasmussen killed Denise and kidnapped her little girl. For the first time, Lisa Jenson was about to learn her real name: Dawn Beaudin.",
      "Headley said, \"I called Lisa up and I asked her if she wanted to know her real name, we had figured it out. And she just got real quiet, and very quietly said yes.\"",
      "Lisa has asked for privacy, but, in a phone call told Rae-Venter that she could finally move on in her life, including getting married.",
      "\"She just said it didn't feel right when she didn't really know who she was or where she'd come from,\" said Rae-Venter. \"And now that she knew that, she felt comfortable now going forward and getting married. I just thought that was so special.\"",
      "Building the Family Tree of a Killer",
      "It was one of the first times that genetic genealogy was used to solve a criminal case \u2013 and word spread fast. In 2017, Rae-Venter got a call: Could she use the same technique to find the Golden State Killer? At the time, there were six full-time investigators and three FBI agents on the case, and they couldn't find him. Rae-Venter thought the DNA would tell her who he was. \"I was absolutely certain of that,\" she said.",
      "Investigators provided a DNA profile left at a California crime scene, and Rae-Venter uploaded it to GED Match and Family Tree DNA. This time, she was building the family tree of a killer.",
      "Sixty-three days later, she said, \"I'm sitting there at three in the morning all by my little lonesome staring at my computer. I know who you are: You're Joseph DeAngelo.\"",
      "I asked, \"At that moment, were you the only person in the world who knew who the Golden State Killer was?\"",
      "\"Besides him? Probably,\" Rae-Venter replied.",
      "It was an astonishing breakthrough. But Rae-Venter's word was not enough to make an arrest. \"I'm providing an investigative lead. You still need some old-fashioned detective work,\" she said.",
      "So investigators got to work getting a DNA sample from DeAngelo himself to confirm he was the right guy. Within days, the brutal killer who had evaded law enforcement for decades was finally behind bars.",
      "In 2020, DeAngelo was sentenced to 13 consecutive life sentences. After DeAngelo was locked away, Rae-Venter decided that it was time to share her incredible story in a book, \"I Know Who You Are.\" She has been profiled in The New York Times, and appeared on Time Magazine's list of the most influential people.",
      "And she's come out of retirement. Her group, Firebird Forensics, works with law enforcement agencies nationwide to solve cases using genetic genealogy, and has solved approximately 60 cases. She even travels around the country teaching others her technique.",
      "In 2023 she described the process of using genetic genealogy as \"very addictive, because you know you're hot on the trail and you just know if you just keep going a little bit longer, you're going to find the connections you're looking for.\"",
      "But her line of work has also raised concerns about privacy. More than 53 million people have already uploaded their DNA profiles to public databases. Should police be able to use that information to track down the users' criminal relatives? \"Well, unfortunately, I think that horse left the barn a long time ago,\" Rae-Venter  said.",
      "And the trade-off may be worth it, says Rae-Venter and others, if it means getting killers and rapists off the streets. Michael O'Malley, the prosecuting attorney in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, said, \"There was a lot of light bulbs going off across the country saying, 'What great technology! How do we bring it to our community to solve violent crimes?'\"",
      "Watch Part Two of Erin Moriarty's report:",
      "Who is John Doe #147?",
      "O'Malley is a witness to a sad statistic in this country: more and more serious crimes are going unsolved. \"I get violent crime reports that come across my desk every day, and only a fraction of those are solved,\" he said.",
      "In 2020, O'Malley's office set up the G.O.L.D. Unit, a team of prosecutors who use the latest forensic tools to find criminals and get them off the streets. It's run by supervising assistant prosecuting attorney Mary Weston. \"We review cases, mostly sexual assaults and homicides at this time, that can be re-investigated using perhaps updated technologies,\" she said.",
      "Among them, cases involving sexual predators, like John Doe #147. \"That's all we knew him as,\" said Weston.",
      "On a hot afternoon in August 1997, a man grabbed a nine-year-old boy in the woods behind a school in the Cleveland suburbs, and sexually assaulted him.",
      "The nine-year-old victim is now a thirty-seven-year old man, who asked us to call him \"Michael,\" and not show his face. Describing the years since the assault, he said, \"It's just been a lot of ups-and-downs, you know? I had doubts, thinking, 'Would I ever, would we ever find the guy?'",
      "\"I remember running to my dad, him taking me to the hospital,\" Michael said. \"But the most I could remember is my mom. She was just crying hysterically on the front porch, just blaming herself, and the neighbors are trying to calm her down.\"",
      "Investigators knew little about the predator back in 1997, according to O'Malley: \"The young boy gave a description, roughly, of his age, and his body build. But really that was it,\" he said.",
      "There was DNA left on the child's clothing. In 2003, a profile was submitted to the federal database (known as CODIS), which contains DNA profiles of convicted offenders. There was no match. So, investigators had a DNA profile, but not a name to go with it.",
      "\"I was crushed,\" said Michael. \"I think, my only hope is just gone. He's gonna actually get away with it.\"",
      "To stop the statute of limitations for rape from running out, \"John Doe #147\" was indicted, but with no leads, the case went cold. Weston said, \"At the time, you know, we were at a loss. What are we gonna do for this boy? He's not a boy anymore, but what can we do to try to help solve his case?\"",
      "Michael said he was scared that the predator might find him again: \"Oh, yeah, I always thought, 'Could this guy be watching?' And he threatened to kill me if I had told anybody about the horrible incident.\"",
      "But in 2018, Michael \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 watched the Golden State Killer case play out on TV. \"And it was like a lightbulb lit above my head,\" he said. \"I'm like, 'Oh, there's another way.'\"",
      "The capture of notorious serial killer James James   DeAngelo introduced the world to investigative genetic genealogy. Could that same technique help solve Michael's case? Investigators would need a more complete profile of the rapist's DNA. But again, there was a hitch: when investigators went looking for the rape kit from Michael's case, they discovered that it had been destroyed.",
      "\"I'm not your victim anymore\"",
      "But investigators didn't give up, and got a stroke of luck when a key piece of evidence was discovered at the county's crime laboratory: an original tube used for testing that could have some leftover DNA. \"I was very, very excited,\" said Weston. \"But then there's the waiting. Is it gonna be enough? And then, 'Are you gonna be able to work with this very tiny amount of DNA?' It's nine nanograms.\"",
      "Astoundingly, it was enough, and in March 2022, they turned to someone familiar: Barbara Rae-Venter, the genealogist who tracked down the Golden State Killer. \"If I had faith in anybody to do it, it was her,\" said Weston. \"She had solved a few cases for us already, and I knew this case was in good hands.\"",
      "It took two months. Rae-Venter came up with a list of suspects, all brothers. Ohio investigators then were able to narrow that list down to just one, and asked Michael to view a photo lineup. \"Immediately, you know, my heart started pounding,\" he said. \"I started getting clammy and sweaty, sorta like a flashback, you know, to when I seen him standing there in the woods.\"",
      "The man he recognized was Dennis Gribble, an Ohio resident with a long history of sex crimes. It was all investigators needed to get a search warrant. Days later, they appeared on Gribble's doorstep to get a DNA sample, telling him, \"Please open your mouth.\"",
      "What was his reaction? \"He was stunned, but he complied,\" O'Malley said. \"And we took it back to our lab and confirmed that he was the individual who sexually assaulted Michael back in 1997.\"",
      "And that's how, in May 2023, John Doe #147, now identified as Dennis Gribble, appeared in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs in a Cleveland courtroom. Michael was there. He looked at Gribble (\"I was just disgusted\"), and read an impact statement to the court: \"I have learned to be a better person and a father than the monster you are and will always be.\"",

    "story": [
      "Astronomers have, for the first time, discovered the moment when planets started to form around a sun-like baby star, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The specks of planet-forming material are emerging around HOPS-315, a protostar or baby star located 1,300 light-years away from us. One light year is approximately 5.88 trillion miles.",
      "While astronomers have seen discs of gas and dust around protostars before, they've never before identified a new planetary system at such an early stage. Minerals in the system around HOPS-315 are just starting to form.",
      "\"We're seeing a system that looks like what our Solar System looked like when it was just beginning to form,\" study co-author Merel van 't Hoff, a professor at Purdue University, said in a news release from the European Southern Observatory (ESO).",
      "The observatory paired up with NASA's Webb Space Telescope to identify the minerals forming the new solar system. Researchers turned to data from our own solar system to determine that these minerals show the start of a new system. In Earth's solar system, the first solid materials to form can now be found inside ancient meteorites. Those ancient meteorites contain a mineral called silicon monoxide, which only forms at extremely high temperatures, like those near a young star.",
      "Scientists were able to identify the formation of silicon monoxide around HOPS-315, which they said tells them they've caught the development of a solar system at an early stage.",
      "\"This is the first time this early stage of planet-building has ever been observed outside our own Solar System,\" the Planetary Society wrote in a social media post about the discovery.",
      "The discovery marks \"the birth of the seeds of the planets,\" study co-author Edwin Bergin, a professor at the University of Michigan, told CBS News. The silicate-mineral rich material around HOPS-315 will make planets after another million years or so.",
      "\"So we are watching the beginnings of the construction of planets,\" Bergin said.",
      "With the discovery, Bergin said researchers now know what to look for to find other budding systems.",
      "ESO's Alma telescope network in Chile captured an image of the still-forming planetary system around HOPS-315. In orange, the image shows the distribution of carbon monoxide blowing away from HOPS-315. Blue shows a narrow jet of silicon monoxide, which is also beaming away from the baby star.",
      "Astronomers hope it can help them learn more about the dawn of our solar system.",
      "\"This system is one of the best that we know to actually probe some of the processes that happened in our Solar System,\" van 't Hoff said in a news release.",
      "HOPS-315 is much younger than the Sun; it's about 100,000 years old, Bergin said.",
      "\"So we get a glimpse of the system in its infancy,\" Bergin said in an email. \"Given that the Sun is 4.6 Billion years old this is a baby star that is still gaining mass and getting bigger.\"",

      "Meteorites come from meteors, space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but the ones that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere are considered meteorites. The chunk of Martian rock that was auctioned off by Sotheby's was likely dislodged from the planet by an asteroid strike.",

      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",

      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",

      "Two black holes combined to make the massive one, according to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, an international group that uses gravitational waves to detect black hole mergers and who identified the event. Gravitational waves occur when there are minute distortions in spacetime, caused by events like black hole mergers, the group said in a news release.",
      "One of the black holes was about 103 times the mass of the sun. The other was about 137 times it. These large black holes may have been formed by even earlier mergers, Mark Hannam, a professor at Cardiff University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, said in the release.",
      "Even within the merger, the black holes are rapidly spinning, scientists said. Their rotation speed is about 400,000 times Earth's rotation speed, the collaboration said in a graphic. They are moving at about 80% to 90% of the maximum possible speed.",
      "\"The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly \u2014 near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,\" said Dr. Charlie Hoy, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, LIGO member and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, in the news release. \"That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret.\"",
      "The massive black hole has been dubbed GW231123. Its unusual size and behavior is challenging scientists' understanding of black hole formation, Hannam said. Previously, the largest known black hole that came from a merger was about 140 times the mass of the sun.",
      "GW231123's discovery is also opening doors for new avenues of research, astronomers said. The behavior and size of the black hole \"pushes the limits of\" current theoretical models and existing gravitational-wave detection technology, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration said.",
      "\"It will take years for the community to fully unravel this intricate signal pattern and all its implications,\" Dr. Gregorio Carullo, a LIGO member and an assistant professor at the University of Birmingham's Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said in a statement. \"Despite the most likely explanation remaining a black hole merger, more complex scenarios could be the key to deciphering its unexpected features.

    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's own policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol,\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's own community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term 'ana' is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a U.K. charity that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under 18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuctions.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform which has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware through its own research of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview, but its global head of safety Antigone Davis said, \"we want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins are a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives on Thursday passed the bill regulating the digital currency .",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House by a 308-122 vote after it was passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The landmark legislation lays out the rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "House Republicans\u00a0announced\u00a0last week that July 14 would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. House lawmakers approved all three bills on Thursday which are now headed to President Trump's desk.",
      "Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 1.40% on Thursday, rising to $120,584.80; etherium's price rose 3.41% to $3,486.86.",
      "Shares of Coinbase, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, rose 3.2% on Thursday, to close at $410.75.",

      "This amounts to an accidental case study in how AI systems embed their creators' values, with Musk's unfiltered public presence making visible what other companies typically obscure.",
      "What is Grok?",
      "Grok is an AI chatbot with \"a\u00a0twist\u00a0of humor and a dash of rebellion\" developed by xAI, which also owns the X social media platform.",
      "The first version of Grok launched in 2023. Independent evaluations suggest the latest model, Grok 4,\u00a0outpaces\u00a0competitors on \"intelligence\" tests. The chatbot is available standalone\u00a0and\u00a0on X.",

      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

    "story": [
      "While online dating apps makes searching for love more convenient, finding that special person is as difficult as ever. A cute photo and simple \"hello\" may not be enough to help you break through the noise, which is why many of those feeling stuck on what to say are turning to artificial intelligence for assistance.",
      "According to a study\u00a0on singles in America released last month by dating app Match.com and The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, 1 in 4 singles \u2014 and nearly half of Gen Z \u2014 use AI to up their dating game. That's a 333% increase from a year ago.",
      "\"People are turning to AI for literally any use case you could imagine,\" said Kasley Killam, a social health and human connection expert. \"And so it's inevitable that people are going to turn to AI for dating coaching.\"",
      "Capitalizing on the trend are AI dating assistants, which coach people on what to say, what tone to strike and how to keep the conversation flowing if it hits a lull. For individuals who feel writing isn't their strong suit, the technology can be a real confidence booster.",
      "Advice on what to say",
      "Roman Khaves, founder of a dating assistant app called Rizz \u2014 which is Gen Z-speak for \"charisma\" \u2014 said the service provides around-the-clock, objective advice for people who can't afford a human dating coach or are unable to reach their friends in a pinch.",
      "\"It'll never sleep on you,\" Khaves told CBS MoneyWatch, describing the app as an \"AI wingwoman or AI wingman in your pocket.\"",
      "Rizz works by letting users upload screenshots of their conversations from dating apps or social media. Rizz then suggests a reply using generative AI. The more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you tend to like or feel comfortable with. That trains the AI model to improve over time.",
      "Rizz has a user base of roughly 10 million, according to Khaves, and is composed of 65% men and 35% women, largely within the 18-to-25 age range.",
      "Another service, called Keepler, a dating-optimization app, has a feature that helps people navigate the dreaded practice known as \"ghosting,\" or when someone abruptly cuts off communication with someone without providing any explanation.",
      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",
      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms. In January, for example, Hinge introduced Prompt Feedback, an AI feature that provides users with immediate feedback on their profiles as they enter information.",
      "AI icebreaker",
      "The growing popularity of AI dating assistants gives rise to questions over authenticity as more users rely on the technology to convey their thoughts and feelings.",
      "One 36-year old Rizz user, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, told CBS MoneyWatch he could see why some people might find using AI to communicate disingenuous, but said he sees the tech simply as a way to stand out from the crowd.",
      "He also acknowledged that some of his dates appeared skeptical after he revealed to them that he was getting behind-the-scenes coaching from Rizz. But he still thinks the service is helpful as a conversation starter.",
      "\"For me personally, it's good for just initiating conversation, getting someone's attention, and then being able to just be myself after that,\" he said.",
      "Killam, the social health and human connection expert, said she thinks AI dating tools can be useful as long as people don't misrepresent who they are or lean on them too much.",
      "\"The risk is when we use AI as a substitute for human connection, rather than a supplement to it,\" she said.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 10:03:30 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump late Thursday ordered the Justice Department to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump late Thursday ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0as his administration faces pressure to disclose more details on the late sex offender.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",
      "Bondi wrote in a post on X minutes later, \"we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\"",
      "A judge will need to make the final decision on whether material can be released, which could take some time and is unlikely to be immediate.",
      "It's unclear what material the Trump administration will ask to be released. It's not clear how much of the Epstein-related material in the government's possession is grand jury testimony.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges, and he was later charged with child sex trafficking in Manhattan in 2019. The government also secured a conviction against Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. It investigated the circumstances of Epstein's death in federal custody, which was deemed a suicide.",
      "The order from Mr. Trump comes after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that Epstein did not have an incriminating \"client list,\" did not try to blackmail any prominent figures, and died by suicide. The memo drew backlash from across the political spectrum, including from some fervent Trump backers, in part because Bondi and other administration figures had promised to release information on Epstein.",
      "The government is generally required to keep grand jury materials secret, and it's common for not all material that is shown to a grand jury \u2014 which meets before a person is criminally indicted \u2014 to emerge during a criminal case.",
      "A request of this kind by the government is unusual, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner, and a former federal prosecutor.",
      "\"I've been in and around federal criminal cases for over 30 years. I've never heard of this before,\" he told CBS News.",
      "While the scope of the government's request is still unknown, Epner says it could encompass an \"enormous quantity of data.\" Mr. Trump said the government would seek the release of grand jury testimony, which Epner noted may include exhibits that witnesses testified about before a grand jury.",
      "\"I would not bet against there being anything, from the most interesting thing in the world to the least interesting thing in the world, in that material,\" said Epner, who told CBS News he believes calls for more information to be disclosed in the Epstein case are warranted.",
      "Epner joked: \"If we were to find out the location of the corpse of Jimmy Hoffa, I would not be surprised.\"",
      "Material likely will not be released immediately, according to Epner, who said, \"weeks would be moving very quickly, months is likely.\" Under court rules, grand jury material is typically only released under certain circumstances, often when it's needed for some other investigation. The government's grounds for release in this case aren't clear.",
      "In this case, both associates and alleged victims of Epstein's may oppose some disclosures.",
      "\"I would not be surprised if a number of people came forward under pseudonyms to object to the release of grand jury material related to them,\" Epner said. \"I also would not be surprised if some of the victims\u2026came forward and said, 'Yes, we do want things to be revealed.'\"",
      "Trump administration faces Epstein fallout",
      "Last week's memo on Epstein reignited years of questions \u2014 and conspiracy theories \u2014 on the disgraced financier, including speculation about the circumstances of Epstein's death in custody, and about whether the federal government was concealing information to shield some of Epstein's famous friends.",
      "Bondi had pledged to release files related to Epstein, and suggested in a Fox News interview in February a \"client list\" was \"sitting on my desk right now to review.\" (She later said she meant generally that material on Epstein was sitting on her desk.)",
      "In late February, the Justice Department distributed binders to over a dozen right-wing social media influencers labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1,\" though the influencers later said many of the materials were already in the public domain.",
      "Some Republicans and vocal Trump supporters were dissatisfied with last week's memo, in some cases calling for more disclosures or the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the Epstein case \u2014 which White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president does not support.",
      "Mr. Trump, for his part, has scolded some Republicans for buying into what he called the \"the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,\" calling them \"stupid people\" and \"weaklings\" who are \"do[ing] the Democrats work.\"",
      "Shortly before pushing for the release of grand jury testimony, the president on Thursday denied a Wall Street Journal report on what the newspaper described as a \"bawdy\" birthday letter to Epstein \u2014 featuring a drawing of a nude woman \u2014 that the paper claimed was signed by Mr. Trump in the early 2000s. Mr. Trump and Epstein had crossed paths for years, though Mr. Trump says they had a \"falling out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called the letter a \"FAKE\" and threatened to sue the Journal, as well as its parent company News Corp and leader Rupert Murdoch.",
      "\"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,\" he said.",
      "CBS News has not independently verified or seen the letter. Dow Jones \u2014 the News Corp division that includes the Journal \u2014 declined to comment on Mr. Trump's threats.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 06:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has said he wants a \"simple redrawing\" of Texas' congressional map where Republicans pick up five seats.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Texas Legislature is set to convene Monday for a special session where it will attempt to redraw the state's congressional map to boost President Trump and his allies' efforts to maintain the GOP's grip on the U.S. House in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The state's decision to recraft the boundaries of House districts comes midway through the decade and several years after its GOP-controlled Legislature adopted a redistricting plan in the wake of the 2020 Census.",
      "Under that plan, Republicans hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats control 12. (The death of Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, has left one seat open.)",
      "But with Republicans holding a razor-thin majority in the House, and the risk the GOP could lose control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, a reshaping of the congressional districts could give Mr. Trump's party an edge heading into next year's elections.",
      "Mr. Trump's political team had been pushing Texas GOP leaders to look into redrawing the state's congressional map, The New York Times reported last month. Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed the Legislature would undertake the effort, among 17 other agenda items, when it meets.",
      "\"I don't think this has anything to do with Texas \u2014 this has to do with Trump,\" said Joshua Blank, the research director of the Texas Politics Project. \"This has nothing to do with the internal dynamics of the state, the political trajectory of the state. This is purely about this election cycle and one person's benefit.\"",
      "How did we get here?",
      "States undergo the redistricting process after every 10-year census, when voting lines are redrawn to account for population changes. After the 2020 Census, Texas crafted a new congressional map to include two new districts, bringing its total number of House seats to 38.",
      "The maps drawn by the GOP-led Texas Legislature aimed to protect Republican seats in Congress and the statehouse. Democrats flipped two congressional districts and 12 state House seats in the 2018 midterms.",
      "\"In 2021, they spent a lot of time and effort making sure they had the best maps possible with the primary goal to ensure that the Republican majority was rock solid,\" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University. \"And they created 24 of 38 districts where there is no way, shape or form that a Republican is losing those districts, absent some type of murder indictment or a serial adulterer, etc.\"",
      "But the final version of the congressional map was met with criticism, and it has been challenged in court. Among the issues raised by voting rights groups is that 95% of Texas' growth has been driven by non-White voters, but the map crafted in 2021 created more majority-White districts.",
      "A three-judge panel in El Paso is currently considering a consolidated challenge to the map brought by voting rights groups, Latino voters and lawmakers. The plaintiffs argue that the new lines violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. A trial ended in June.",
      "Texas has a part-time Legislature, which meets for 140 days every two years. The governor has the power to call special sessions to cover specific topics, and the special sessions constitutionally cannot last longer than 30 days. The governor can, however, call as many special sessions as he deems necessary. After the 88th legislative session in 2023, Abbott called four special sessions that stretched into December.",
      "Redistricting is one of 18 topics that Abbott has asked the Legislature to address. Four of those topics include disaster relief for the Central Texas floods and improving the state's warning system.",
      "\"I'm not convinced that the goal is to pass everything, but ultimately, Abbott gets the credit for trying, and the Legislature will get the credit for what it can accomplish, but it'll also get the blame for what it fails to do,\" Blank said.",
      "Although the Democrats could leave the state to deny Republicans a quorum, like they did in 2021 to protest a voting bill, it's unlikely they would do so if it meant holding up flood relief.",
      "Where does Trump and his administration come into play?",
      "Texas has conducted two congressional elections under the 2021 map. But earlier this month, the Justice Department sent Abbott a letter alleging that some of the districts were racial gerrymanders that violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.",
      "Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, specifically pinpointed four districts \u2014 the 9th, 18th, 29th and 33rd \u2014 that she said constitute \"coalition districts\" that should be redrawn. All three are currently represented by Democrats, and Turner, who died in March, represented the fourth.",
      "Coalition districts are those that bring two or more racial minorities together to make up a majority of the population, and where voters from these groups vote together to elect their preferred candidate.",
      "In her letter, Dhillon wrote that the state had to \"immediately\" rectify the alleged racial gerrymanders, and if it chose not to, it was at risk of legal action by the attorney general.",
      "\"The congressional districts at issue are nothing more than vestiges of an unconstitutional racially based gerrymandering past, which must be abandoned, and must now be corrected by Texas,\" she wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump appears to be on board with the recrafting of Texas' voting boundaries. Before leaving the White House on Tuesday, the president said he is looking for a \"simple redrawing\" where Republicans pick up five seats.",
      "\"Texas would be the biggest one,\" he said.",
      "But during the trial in the case involving the congressional map, state officials repeatedly said they were motivated not by race when they drew the district lines, but instead driven by politics. State Sen. Joan Huffman, a Republican who led the 2021 Senate Redistricting Committee, testified that the congressional map was \"drawn blind to race\" and \"racial data was not considered at all during the drawing of the maps,\" according to court records.",
      "\"There is no legal justification for doing this. It sort of walks and talks and quacks like a political move,\" said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. \"The problem is that it's really difficult to get more seats in Texas without heavily undermining the political power of communities of color.\"",
      "In claims of racial gerrymandering, those challenging a map have to show that race predominated for how the lines were drawn.",
      "\"This can't be a racial gerrymander if they didn't consider race,\" Li said. \"This is a textbook, easy it's-not-a-racial-gerrymander. \u2026 If you didn't consider race, it can't be a racial gerrymander.\"",
      "Has Texas drawn new maps in the middle of the decade before?",
      "A divided Texas Legislature drew up a congressional map in 2001, but two years later, in a plan engineered by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, Republicans wanted to redraw the lines to make the most of the growing GOP majority in the state.",
      "Fifty-one Democrats in the state House fled to Oklahoma for four days, denying the Republicans the quorum they needed to bring the redistricting plan to the floor and letting the clock run out on the regular session. Then-Gov. Rick Perry called the Legislature back for a special session, but state Senate Democrats left the state to deny a quorum.",
      "Although the Democrats remained out of state for more than a month, they couldn't stop the maps from eventually passing, and Republicans ultimately picked up five seats. The Supreme Court upheld the congressional districts in 2018.",
      "But former Democratic Rep. Mark Strama, who ran for office after that round of redistricting, warned the effort did have some downsides for Republicans. The drama was covered nationally, and Strama himself flipped a Central Texas district in 2005.",
      "\"Voters were mad at both sides,\" Strama said. \"They hate all these political shenanigans. But there's no question voters hate this.\"",
      "While Texas has redrawn the lines of congressional districts in the middle of a decade before, Li said the current situation is far from normal.",
      "\"Outside of litigation, it is extremely rare,\" he said. \"And it's exceptionally rare \u2014 in fact, I can't think of another circumstance, where a party drew the map, and then that same party redrew the map. Where there are mid-decade redistrictings, it's usually because political control changes hands.\"",
      "Could this plan backfire?",
      "While Democrats have not won statewide office in Texas since 1994, the best year Democrats have had at the ballot in the past two decades was in 2018. In that midterm election, former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke came within three points of GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and Democrats flipped two congressional seats and 12 state House seats.",
      "Republicans have managed to quell those gains and, as Jones noted, the 2024 election was a high point for the party. But the dynamics of the 2026 election could mirror those in 2018, when Democrats ran aggressive campaigns targeting Mr. Trump and retook the House. Any changes to the congressional map might not be enough to stem Democratic gains this time around.",
      "\"If Republicans do engage, do go all out and try with the goal of flipping, say three, four, even five seats as President Trump says \u2014 it's far more likely Republicans see a net loss than a net gain,\" Jones said.",
      "Plus, any map adopted by the GOP-led Legislature and approved by Abbott is likely to be swiftly met with lawsuits. If a federal court blocks its use, the new district lines may not even be in place for the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"President Trump is talking about five more seats out of Texas, and the only way you get five more seats out of Texas is if you seriously undermine the political power and the political voice of communities of color,\" Li said. \"And that is a Texas-sized lawsuit with potentially huge ramifications.\"",
      "Li said the redrawing of political bounds to give Republicans a leg up in the 2026 midterm elections is not only a legally risky move, but could be politically perilous too.",
      "\"The essence of trying to get more seats is that you have to spread your voters out more if you're a Republican,\" he said. \"So you have a bunch more districts that you're not winning by 65 or 70%. You're going to have a bunch of districts that you're winning by 52, 53% and in a state that is changing as fast as Texas, that's growing as fast as Texas, that's changing demographically as fast as Texas. By 2030, these districts could look and perform very differently.\"",
      "The 2020 Census showed that people of color accounted for 95% of Texas' population growth over the prior decade. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau released last year also showed that the number of Asian Americans in Texas grew by nearly 92,000 people, while there were more than 91,000 new Black residents in the state.",
      "\"When you gerrymander, you're making a bet that you know what the politics of the future will look like,\" Li said. \"There are many places where you can safely bet on what the politics of the future will look like in the country. Texas is not one of those places. It's just changing too fast.\"",
      "Republicans have made big gains in South Texas' Rio Grande Valley, once considered a Democratic stronghold. But even with those GOP gains \u2014 and running on the maps drawn in 2021\u00a0 \u2014 two of the three seats remained Democratic in 2024.",
      "\"People talk about the Rio Grande Valley as if it's somehow indicative of Texas,\" said Blank of the Texas Politics Project. \"It's less than 3.5% of the total statewide vote, and it's incredibly economically depressed and it's overwhelmingly Hispanic. It's not really indicative of any part of the state, it's indicative of its region of the country that happens to share a border with Mexico.\"",
      "What can Democrats do?",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the states have lambasted Republicans for pushing to redraw congressional district lines to hold onto power in the House.",
      "\"Elected officials should earn the support of voters they hope to represent,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Tuesday. \"Republicans want a country where politicians choose their voters, not the other way around. It reeks of desperation, and we're going to do everything that we can in Texas and beyond to respond.\"",
      "Jeffries said the reason for the special session in Texas is to \"try to steal the midterm elections by rigging\" the state's congressional map.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, has suggested that Democrats mount their own partisan gerrymander. California has 52 congressional districts, and Democrats represent 43 of them.",
      "\"There are *currently* 9 Republicans in the California Congressional Delegation. Just thought folks might like to know that fun fact,\" he wrote on X\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "During an appearance on the podcast \"Pod Save America,\" Newsom accused Republicans of trying to \"rig the game\" because they're concerned about maintaining control of the House next year.",
      "California voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2010 that handed over the task of crafting congressional and state legislative districts to an independent commission. But Newsom suggested there are still two paths that could lead to a new congressional map: calling a special session of the California Legislature to put a measure on the ballot for a special election that would clear the way for new House district lines; or having the state Legislature create a new map under the idea that it's coming mid-decade and not after the census.",
      "\"It ups the stakes of the redistricting war, with the acknowledgment that Democrats have a limited hand to play,\" Li said of Texas' decision to draw new congressional lines.",
      "Just 15 states have Democratic trifectas, where they control the state legislature and the governorship. Two of those states, Colorado and Michigan, leave the drawing of political voting lines to independent commissions like California does. Republicans are in full control in 23 states.",
      "Plus, in other states where Democrats control the legislature and governor's mansions, the congressional delegations already heavily skew Democratic. In Illinois, for example, Democrats hold 14 of its 17 House seats. Maryland's eight-member congressional delegation contains just one Republican.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 21:15:26 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of firing Jerome Powell \u2014 whom he first appointed Federal Reserve chair \u2014 earlier this week, after years of on-and-off criticism over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump asked about the idea of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a meeting with lawmakers this week, CBS News has reported, a legally untested move that follows years of on-and-off criticism of the Fed leader leveled by Mr. Trump.",
      "The president's gripes with his handpicked Fed chair \u2014 whom he has called a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule\" \u2014 have largely focused on the central bank's decision to keep interest rates relatively high so far this year, part of an inflation-fighting campaign. Mr. Trump has also taken aim at Powell's handling of a Federal Reserve office renovation project.",
      "Mr. Trump asked a group of House Republicans if he should fire Powell during a Tuesday night Oval Office meeting, sources told CBS News earlier this week. The president told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he'll fire Powell, though he confirmed he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him,\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Who is Jerome Powell, and who appointed him?",
      "Powell is the chair of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first term, replacing Obama appointee Janet Yellen, and the Senate confirmed him in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "\"He's strong, he's committed, he's smart,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech announcing his decision to nominate Powell in 2017, praising Powell's reputation as a \"consensus-builder.\"",
      "Last month, though, Mr. Trump said he initially nominated Powell because he \"listened to someone that I shouldn't have listened to, and Biden shouldn't have reappointed him.\"",
      "Before becoming chair, Powell had served on the central bank's Board of Governors since 2012, when he was initially nominated by former President Barack Obama.",
      "Powell has switched between government and private-sector jobs for much of his career. He worked in investment banking in the 1980s and 1990s, interrupted by a stint as former President George H.W. Bush's undersecretary of the Treasury. For almost 20 years starting in the 1990s, he was a partner at the Carlyle Group investment firm, according to his Fed biography.",
      "A Georgetown-educated lawyer, Powell does not have a Ph.D. in economics, unlike some other former Fed chairs.",
      "Does Jerome Powell have a designated term length?",
      "Federal Reserve chairs serve for four-year terms, so Powell's stint as chair will end in May 2026.",
      "Members of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors, however, serve for 14 years, and Powell's term as a board member ends in January 2028. Yellen resigned from the board after her term as Fed chair ended, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has encouraged Powell to follow suit, though Powell's plans are unclear.",
      "The chair and board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "What does the Federal Reserve do?",
      "The Federal Reserve is the United States' central bank. Made up of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks and a D.C.-based Board of Governors, its responsibilities include regulating the U.S. banking system, serving as a \"lender of last resort\" to banks and running an instant payment system.",
      "But one of the Federal Reserve's highest-profile responsibilities is its role in setting monetary policy. Through its 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which includes Powell, the Fed works independently of elected officials to influence the supply of money in the U.S. economy and the interest rates at which it's lent out, with an eye toward keeping unemployment low and prices stable.",
      "Those two goals \u2014 maximizing employment and minimizing inflation \u2014 are known as the Fed's \"dual mandate.\" But they're in conflict with each other. If the Fed lowers interest rates, it can boost economic growth, but it also runs the risk of overheating the economy and pushing up inflation. And if interest rates are hiked, inflation tends to cool off, but the economy slows down.",
      "The interest rate that the Fed targets is called the Federal Funds Rate, which is what banks charge to lend money to each other overnight. But other interest rates \u2014 from mortgage rates to yields for U.S. government bonds \u2014 tend to follow closely with the Federal Funds Rate, so the Fed's decisions impact borrowing costs for average American consumers and businesses.",
      "Picking the right balance isn't easy, and the Fed often faces criticism for its choices.",
      "Under Powell, the Fed dropped its target interest rate to near 0% at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with the goal of averting an economic catastrophe. But after the economy recovered and inflation soared, the central bank in 2023 hiked interest rates to their highest point in decades, aiming to get inflation under control. The Fed has taken a cautious path since then, cutting rates slightly last year as inflation fell but keeping them steady so far this year.",
      "Last month, the Fed's rate-setting committee said it may cut rates later this year, but there are concerns that inflation \u2014 which is still above the Fed's 2%-per-year target \u2014 could worsen. Powell has also suggested the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could increase inflation.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said last month.",
      "Why is Trump unhappy with the Fed and Jerome Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump is unhappy with the Fed's decision to leave rates stable. For months, the president has pushed the central bank to slash rates immediately, calling Powell \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "The president argued last month that inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates.",
      "\"If he was concerned about Inflation or anything else, then all he has to do is bring the Rate down, so we can benefit on Interest Costs, and raise it in the future when and if these 'other elements' happen (which I doubt they will!),\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He's not the first president to criticize the Fed for high interest rates, which make everything from car loans to mortgages more expensive and can put a damper on the economic growth that tends to make or break presidents' popularity. But Mr. Trump has been unusually vocal.",
      "In a mid-June post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called Powell a \"Total and Complete Moron\" and urged the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to \"override\" him. While Powell is just one of 12 votes on the committee, the chair traditionally has an outsize role in its decisions. The last few decisions to leave interest rates stable have been unanimous.",
      "Mr. Trump had similar issues with Powell during his first term, saying during an earlier interest rate-hiking campaign in 2018 that he was \"not even a little bit happy with my selection\" of Powell. When the Fed cut rates in 2020, Mr. Trump called Powell his \"most improved player.\"",
      "Meanwhile, members of the Trump administration have pressured Powell over a yearslong renovation to the Fed's headquarters complex. In a letter to the central banker, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought called some of the features \"ostentatious,\" and alleged that Powell may have misled Congress about the project's scope or made changes to the plans without getting permission from the right federal bodies.",
      "Mr. Trump has also criticized Powell over the renovations. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he's \"highly unlikely\" to fire Powell \"unless he has to leave for fraud.\" At other points, Mr. Trump has suggested Powell should resign over the project.",
      "Powell said last year he would not resign as chair if asked to do so.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter to Vought and denied allegations that it was overly lavish, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually. Powell added the Fed has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further government review is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a high degree of independence over its own budget, and legally has the power to buy and remodel office spaces in Washington, D.C., as it sees fit.",
      "Is the Fed independent from the rest of the government? And can Trump fire Powell?",
      "The structure of the Fed \u2014 with board members and chairs who serve across multiple administrations \u2014 allows it to make decisions without direct input from politicians.",
      "Whether the president can fire Powell before his term ends is legally untested. Federal law says members of the Federal Reserve board can only be removed by the president before their terms end \"for cause,\" and the Supreme Court found in 1935 that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court did allow Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards, but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell before his term ends could also roil financial markets, analysts and lawmakers from both parties have warned. Mr. Trump acknowledged this risk Wednesday, telling Just The News in an interview, \"They say it would disrupt the market if I did.\"",
      "At some points in the Federal Reserve's 112-year history, including during World War II, the central bank has been more beholden to the needs of the Treasury. But the Fed has operated more independently since 1951, when a public disagreement between the Fed and the Truman administration led the Treasury to agree to let the central bank set interest rates on its own.",
      "There's nothing preventing the president from publicly expressing his views about the Fed, though, as several of Mr. Trump's predecessors have. During his campaign last year, Mr. Trump said he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "\"In my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve, or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in an August 2024 press briefing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in April that Mr. Trump \"has the right to express his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\"",

      "Bondi toured Alcatraz, currently part of the National Park Service, along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, arriving on a Coast Guard vessel. They were joined by a contingent of administration officials and Secret Service staffers who walked in the chilly bay air among the crumbling buildings, many dating back to the late 19th century.",
      "The attorney general was seen posing for pictures in front of Alcatraz signs and vista points on the island. Later, Bondi and Burgum posted images of their tour on the X social media platform.",

      "Trump administration's push to reopen Alcatraz",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Justice told CBS News that Bondi and Burgum were visiting Alcatraz to receive a briefing on the facility and the surrounding island. They were also directing staff to collaborate on the necessary planning to rehabilitate and reopen the facility, the spokesperson said.",
      "In an interview on Fox News, Bondi spoke about Alcatraz's potential to once again hold prisoners.",
      "\"Alcatraz could hold the worst of the worst. It could hold middle-class violent prisoners, it could hold illegal aliens, it could hold anything,\" said Bondi. \"This is a terrific facility, needs a lot of work, but no one has been known to escape from Alcatraz and survive.\"",
      "In May, Mr. Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he was directing the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and Homeland Security to \"reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.\"",
      "Following the announcement, Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III said in a statement that his agency would \"vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President's agenda\" and that he ordered \"an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps.\"",
      "Alcatraz's history as federal penitentiary",
      "The former Army fortress and military prison was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and housed the country's most infamous criminals, such as Al Capone and \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. However, most of the inmates were not notorious gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules of other federal institutions.",
      "The prison was said to be escape-proof because of the strong bay currents and cold waters surrounding it. The Bureau of Prisons says\u00a0of the 36 men involved in 14 separate escape attempts, 23 were caught, 6 were shot and killed during their escape, and 2 drowned, leaving five others as either successfully escaped or presumed drowned.",
      "The penitentiary was closed in 1963 due to the high operating costs and deteriorating facilities. In 1972, Alcatraz was designated part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area\u00a0under the National Park Service, and the following year it opened to the public as a historic site and tourist attraction. The site\u00a0has undergone multiple restoration efforts to improve visitor facilities and preserve historic structures and natural habitats around the island.",
      "Alcatraz a money-maker for federal government, San Francisco",
      "Alcatraz currently receives about 1.6 million visitors from around the world every year, according to the Park Service. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi lambasted the Trump administration's plans\u00a0to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, which would put an end to the approximately $60 million in annual revenue that tourism brings to the National Park Service and the city.",
      "\"With stiff competition, the planned announcement to reopen Alcatraz as a federal penitentiary is the Trump Administration's stupidest initiative yet,\" said Pelosi in a prepared statement. \"It should concern us all that clearly the only intellectual resources the Administration has drawn upon for this foolish notion are decades-old fictional Hollywood movies.\"",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie had no plans to meet with either Bondi or Burgum, according to his office. He issued a statement criticizing the Trump administration's plans for Alcatraz.",
      "\"There's no realistic plan to make Alcatraz reopen as anything other than the wonderful tourist attraction that it currently is,\" Lurie said. \"If the federal government wants to spend billions of dollars, I want them to spend it on clean and safe streets and San Francisco's economic recovery. Alcatraz draws millions of visitors a year, tens of millions of dollars in economic activity, and that is benefiting San Francisco's recovery. We're on the rise and that's what I'm focused on.\"",
      "It's estimated that reopening Alcatraz as a prison would cost hundreds of millions of dollars upfront and up to $100 million a year in operating costs. When the penitentiary was closed in 1963, the annual operating costs were more than three times that of any other federal prison, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",

      "The potential change in policies around carrying liquids on flights comes after Noem on July 8 said passengers at airports no longer have to remove their shoes during regular TSA security checks. That change went into effect immediately.",
      "Speaking at a conference hosted Wednesday by publication The Hill, Noem said she's questioning \"everything TSA does\" and spoke of possible changes to the amount of liquids travelers can tote in their carry-on baggage. Under current TSA guidance, travelers can carry liquids in travel-sized containers of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item in their carry-on bag.",
      "\"The liquids, I'm questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be,\" Noem said. \"We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it's still as safe.\"",

      "The rules for liquids on flights were a response to a 2006 incident in which authorities foiled a plot to used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage to blow up planes.",
      "Ever since the guidelines were adopted, TSA checkpoints have been the scene of travelers quickly guzzling water, digging through luggage to find and discard a too-large tube of hair gel, and chucking jars of everything from jam to coffee that didn't meet the size requirement.",
      "The regulations also triggered myriad discussions \u2014 sometimes arguments \u2014 over what constitutes a liquid. Yogurt? Peanut butter? Jam and jelly? All are currently restricted to containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces as detailed on an extensive list that TSA maintains on its website titled \"What can I bring?\"",

    "summary": "Brett Hankison was convicted in 2024\u200b of using excessive force during a botched 2020 drug raid that left Breonna Taylor dead.",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Justice asked in a sentencing memo that\u00a0Brett Hankison \u2014 a former Kentucky police officer who was convicted in connection with a raid that resulted in Breonna Taylor's death \u2014 serve one day in prison.",
      "Hankison was convicted in 2024 of using excessive force during a botched 2020 drug raid that left Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, dead.",
      "The then-Louisville police officer fired 10 shots into Taylor's glass door and windows during the raid, but didn't hit anyone. Some shots flew into a next-door neighbor's adjoining apartment. Taylor was shot in her hallway by two other officers after her boyfriend fired from inside the apartment, striking an officer in the leg. Police did not find any narcotics at the apartment \u2014 and afterward, Taylor's death became a rallying cry for racial justice across the country.",
      "Hankison was cleared of a federal charge of using excessive force on Taylor's neighbors, and during a 2022 state trial, he was acquitted of all charges after a jury deliberated for three hours. His first federal civil rights trial in 2023 ended in a mistrial.",
      "A federal judge will decide Hankison's sentence, which could amount to several years, at a hearing set for Monday.",
      "The government requested in the sentencing memo released Wednesday that Hankison receive a sentence of time served, which would be one day in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.",
      "President Trump's appointee to run the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department,\u00a0Harmeet Dhillon, and a senior non-career official in the division signed the memo, seemingly instead of attorneys or staff who usually handle sentencing filings.",
      "The memo said multiple prosecutions against Hankison were sought, while only one portion succeeded in securing a conviction. While the DOJ respects the jury's decision, the memo said, it \"will almost certainly ensure that defendant Hankison never serves as a law enforcement officer again and will also likely ensure that he never legally possesses a firearm again.\"",
      "A lengthy sentence would \"simply be unjust\" under the circumstances in the government's view, the memo said.",
      "Attorneys for Taylor's family, including civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, decried the DOJ's request.",
      "\"This recommendation is an insult to the life of Breonna Taylor and a blatant betrayal of the jury's decision,\" their statement said. \"Every American who believes in equal justice under the law should be outraged. It is unfathomable that, after finally securing a conviction, the Department of Justice would seek a sentence so drastically below the federal guidelines.\"",
      "The lawyers said it would set \"a dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"When a police officer is found guilty of violating someone's constitutional rights, there must be real accountability and justice,\" they wrote. \"Recommending just one day in prison sends the unmistakable message that white officers can violate the civil rights of Black Americans with near-total impunity.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol,\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's own community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term 'ana' is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a U.K. charity that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under 18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuctions.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform which has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware through its own research of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview, but its global head of safety Antigone Davis said, \"we want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

    "story": [
      "It is one of history's most intriguing \"murders\" \u2014 the mysterious disappearance over five centuries ago of two young princes from the Tower of London.",
      "Nearly 200 years after they disappeared, two small skeletons were found in a wooden box at the historic tower and reburied at Westminster Abbey.",
      "The remains were believed, but never proved, to be those of the two brothers \u2014 heir to the throne Edward, 12, and Richard, 9, the sons of King Edward IV of England, who were reputedly murdered at the behest of their uncle, Richard Duke of Gloucester.",
      "William Shakespeare later immortalized him in Richard III as a scheming hunchback who did away with his royal nephews so he could take the crown himself, sealing his reputation as a child killer.",
      "Now British author Philippa Langley, who helped unearth Richard's body from a central England parking lot in 2012, has claimed that the princes \u2014 far from being killed \u2014 actually survived.",
      "The elder prince, Edward, was heir to the throne at the time of his disappearance and would have ruled as King Edward V of England.",
      "Langley decided to delve into the mystery after coming to believe that the conventional narrative in which Richard had the young princes killed smacked of \"history being written by the victors.\"",
      "She was finally spurred into action after reading an article about Richard's reburial at Leicester Cathedral in 2015 which questioned whether the nation should honor a \"child killer.\"",
      "\"I think I'd always realized that the story sort of developed during the reign of the Tudors,\" she said, adding that it was then \"repeated and repeated over time\" until it became \"truth and fact.\"",
      "Historical \"whodunnit\"",
      "The last English king to die in battle, Richard ruled from 1483 until his brutal death at the Battle of Bosworth near Leicester in 1485, aged 32.",
      "Bosworth was the last major conflict in the Wars of the Roses and changed the course of English history because the Tudor dynasty of Henry VII captured the crown from Richard's Plantagenets.",
      "Langley attributes the accepted story that Richard had the boys murdered to King Henry VII, a \"very, very intelligent individual, but suspicious and highly paranoid.\"",
      "\"He had a massive spy network working for him. And he was able to completely control the narrative,\" she said, adding that Richard ended up \"covered in Tudor mud.\"",
      "Taking a cold case review approach to the historical \"whodunnit,\" Langley says she assembled a group of investigative specialists, including police and lawyers, to advise her.",
      "\"They said: 'Look, if you haven't got any confirmed, identified bodies, then it has to be a missing persons investigation and you have to follow that methodology.' They said: 'You have to actively look for evidence,'\" Langley said. \"That's when it really started to get interesting.\"",
      "Langley put out an appeal for volunteers to scour archives and was inundated with offers of help from people ranging from ordinary citizens to medieval historians.",
      "The result was the decade-long Missing Princes Project, which she says unearthed a significant amount of information pointing to the survival of both young princes.",
      "\"History's greatest cold case\"",
      "Langley now believes that it is up to Richard's detractors to disprove the survival thesis, which she outlines in the new book \"The Princes in the Tower: How History's Greatest Cold Case Was Solved.\"",
      "\"The onus is now on them to find the evidence that the boys died,\" she said. \"They cannot say Richard III murdered the princes in the tower any more because we found numerous proofs of life everywhere.\"",
      "Key to Langley's conviction that both boys survived are documents discovered supporting a rebellion by \"Edward IV's son.\"",
      "During the rebellion in 1487, Lambert Simnel, a pretender to the throne who came forward after Richard's death, was crowned in Dublin.",
      "According to fresh references found by the project, the boy was \"called\" or said to be \"a son of King Edward,\" which she believes points to Simnel being the elder prince, son of Edward IV.",
      "The reaction to Langley's research has been mixed.",
      "Michael Dobson, director and a professor of Shakespeare studies at the University of Birmingham's Shakespeare Institute, expressed skepticism.",
      "\"Given the ways of dynastic monarchy, I think Richard would have been taking a very big risk in leaving those princes alive,\" he said. \"The chances of their having accidentally gone missing while incarcerated on his orders in the Tower of London seem pretty remote.\"",
      "Langley, a mother of two, initially became interested in Richard III in 1998 after reading a biography that questioned the Shakespearean portrayal of him, the BBC reported.",
      "She authored the book\u00a0\"The Lost King: The Search for Richard III,\"\u00a0co-written with Michael Jones, which chronicles her search for Richard III's lost remains.",
      "The book was turned into a movie, starring Sally Hawkins as Langley and Steve Coogan, who co-wrote the film, as her husband. The film was released in October 2022 after premiering at the\u00a0Toronto Film Festival\u00a0in September 2022.",

      "New Delhi \u2014 At least 33 people were killed and dozens injured by lightning strikes in the eastern Indian state of Bihar this week, officials said Friday. The deaths occurred as powerful storms and monsoon rains battered the state.",
      "Most of the deaths were reported on Wednesday and Thursday, when intense storms hit at least 10 districts in Bihar. Most of the victims were agricultural workers, including an elderly man killed by a lightning strike in the Nalanda district while he was out with grazing cattle. Two women were seriously injured in the same place and were being treated for burns.",
      "The state government has urged residents to take precautions, including remaining indoors during bad weather. Nitish Kumar, Bihar's Chief Minister, announced government compensation of 4 million Indian rupees (about $4,600) for the families of those killed.",
      "The storms and lightning are likely to continue, as monsoon rains are expected to continue for weeks in the region. India's Meteorological Department has predicted light to heavy rainfall in most parts of the southern and northeastern parts of Bihar until at least July 24.",
      "Lightning strikes are common during monsoon season in north and eastern India. More than 2,500 people in India are struck by lightning every year, according to government data. In Bihar alone, at least 243 people were killed by lightning strikes last year, and 275 died in 2023. In November 2023, lightning strikes during unseasonal rainfall killed 24 people in the western Indian state of Gujarat.",
      "A typical lightning strike packs around 300 million volts of electricity, which is capable of causing instant death or severe burn injuries. Scientists say climate change is leading to increased lightning activity and more intense storms. Rising land and sea surface temperatures mean there is more heat energy to fuel the thunderstorms that causes lightning.",
      "A study by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, said lightning strikes in the U.S. could increase by 12% for every degree Celsius rise in average temperature. One person was killed and over a dozen others were injured after being struck by lightning in Jackson Township, New Jersey on Wednesday.",
      "India's east and northeast region is also prone to annual flooding that has killed dozens of people and displace hundreds of thousands during monsoon season. The seasonal rains wreaked havoc in southern India last year, too. In July 2024, massive landslides sparked by monsoon rains killed at least 158 people in the southern state of Kerala.",

      "The family's statement said his younger brother carried him to an ambulance after the group cleared, but that Musallet died before he was able to reach the hospital.",
      "He had been due to return to his home in Tampa, Florida, this week, his relatives said.",
      "Musallet's killing comes amid an\u00a0increase in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Thameen Al-Kheetan, said Tuesday.",
      "\"Israeli settlers and security forces have intensified their\u00a0killings, attacks and harassment of Palestinians\u00a0in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in the past weeks,\" Al-Kheetan said.",
      "He said that \"during the first half of 2025, there have been 757 settler attacks that resulted in Palestinian casualties or property damage \u2014 a 13 per cent increase on the same period in 2024.\"",
      "\"Israel must immediately stop these killings, harassment and home demolitions across the occupied Palestinian territory,\" Al-Kheetan said. \"As the occupying power, Israel must take all feasible measures to ensure public order and safety in the West Bank. It is under the obligation to protect Palestinians from settler attacks and to end the unlawful use of force by its security forces. There must be thorough, independent and transparent investigations into all killings and all other alleged violations of international law. Those responsible must be held to account.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces told CBS News on Wednesday that immediately \"following the incident, a joint investigation was launched by the Israel Police and the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division.\"",
      "On Thursday, a U.S. State Department spokesperson offered condolences to the family and said it was providing consular assistance. The spokesperson said Israeli authorities had announced the arrest of six people in connection with the incident, but neither the IDF nor Israeli police replied to CBS News' questions about the investigation, and there was no confirmation from Israeli authorities of any arrests. Israeli media reported soon after the incident that six people were detained but later released.",
      "On Friday, a spokesperson for the Israeli police said the police and the IDF were \"currently carrying out a joint investigation regarding the death of a Palestinian-American citizen, alleged to have occurred following a confrontation near Sinjil.\"",
      "The statement said at the time of the incident, \"security forces restored order and made arrests on both sides.\"",
      "\"Although no official report was filed regarding a homicide at the time the claim surfaced, and no access to the body was granted to allow for proper forensic examination or collection of critical evidence, the police and IDF have nonetheless launched a proactive investigation to clarify the circumstances surrounding the circulating allegations. If criminal actions are found to have occurred, accountability will be pursued in accordance with the law,\" the police spokesperson said.",
      "Musallet's family said they had not been informed of any arrests related to his killing.",
      "Last week, the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on President Trump to hold Israel accountable for Musallet's death and \"put America first.\"",
      "\"This murder is only the latest killing of an American citizen by illegal Israeli settlers or soldiers,\" CAIR-Florida Executive Director Imam Abdullah Jaber said in a statement. \"Every other murder of an American citizen has gone unpunished by the American government, which is why the Israeli government keeps wantonly killing American Palestinians and, of course, other Palestinians. If President Trump will not even put America first when Israel murders American citizens, then this is truly an Israel First administration.\"",
      "Other U.S. citizens who have been killed in the Israel-occupied West Bank include Al Jazeera journalist\u00a0Shireen Abu Akleh, who died in 2022, and activist\u00a0Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, who was killed last year. Both were allegedly killed by Israeli forces, and the Israeli military has said it is investigating, but nobody has been held accountable for either of their deaths to date.",

    "story": [
      "Felix Baumgartner, the daredevil who made a record-breaking parachute jump from the stratosphere in 2012, died Thursday in a paragliding accident in Italy, a local mayor confirmed. Firefighters who responded to the scene said they found a paraglider that had crashed into the side of a swimming pool in the city of Porto Sant Elpidio, on central Italy's eastern coast.",
      "\"Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,\" the town's Mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said on Facebook.",
      "Baumgartner, 56, made global headlines in 2012 when he was lifted into the stratosphere, about 24 miles up, in a capsule carried by a helium balloon, and then parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico. During the jump, he broke the record for fastest free fall, descending at about 843.6 mph and becoming the first human to break the sound barrier without the assistance of a vehicle.",
      "Originally from Austria, Baumgartner began skydiving at age 16 and further honed his skills in the Austrian military, according to his personal website. In 1988, he teamed up with Red Bull, which sponsored the stratosphere jump under the Stratos project and many other daring feats.",
      "The training and planning for the 2012 Stratos jump took five years. Among the records Baumgartner would break that day was highest jump, which had been held by Air Force Capt. Joe Kittinger since 1960, when he leapt from an open-air gondola basket that rose to 102,000 feet. Kittinger would go on to train Baumgartner for the record-breaking Stratos jump. (Baumgartner's height record was broken two years later.)",
      "In addition to skydiving, Baumgartner was an accomplished BASE jumper, breaking two records in 1999: highest BASE jump and lowest BASE jump. The low jump, which he took from one of the hands of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, was only 95 feet. The high jump was taken from the 88th floor of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, although that record has since been broken and is currently held by the late Valery Rozov, who jumped from Cho Oyu in 2016.",
      "Baumgartner was also a helicopter pilot and was part of Red Bull's aerial acrobatics team.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to jump out of a plane,\" Baumgartner told Red Bull in an interview after becoming a licensed helicopter pilot.",
      "\"For Red Bull Stratos, we had a very long list of 'what ifs,' in other words eventualities that could happen and how we would deal with them in an emergency. The list kept getting longer and longer. I was only afraid of the things that were not on the list. The things we had not thought of,\" he told Red Bull, adding, \"to this day, I abort missions if the conditions are not right.\"",
      "While Baumgartner's stunts inspired millions, his political views were known to cause controversy. On social media, he mocked climate activists and others who sought to limit the effects of climate change, and voiced opposition to LGBTQ rights, according to the AFP news agency. He also once suggested Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-immigration policies.",

    "summary": "Puerto Rican Gov. Jennifer Gonzalez signed a bill into law that bans hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries for transgender people under 21.",
    "story": [
      "Puerto Rico's governor has signed a bill that prohibits hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgeries for transgender youth, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from activists in the largely conservative United States territory. Puerto Rican Gov. Jennifer Gonzalez approved the law late Wednesday, following a wave of similar legislation passed across the U.S.",
      "The law applies to people younger than 21 and calls for 15 years in prison for any violators, as well as a $50,000 penalty and the revocation of all licenses and permits of medical staff.",
      "\"Minors, having not yet reached the necessary emotional, cognitive, and physical maturity, are particularly vulnerable to making decisions that can have irreversible consequences,\" the law reads. \"Therefore, it is the State's duty to ensure their comprehensive well-being.\"",
      "It also states that public funds cannot be used for such purposes.",
      "Puerto Rico's LGBTQ+ Federation criticized the law in a statement Thursday.",
      "\"Let there be no doubt: We will go to court to challenge the constitutionality of the governor's cruel and inhumane signing of a law that criminalizes health professionals for caring for trans minors,\" said Justin Jes\u00fas Santiago, the federation's director.",

      "GLAAD, a nonprofit organization focused on LGBTQ rights advocacy and media monitoring, were among the critics that had urged Gonzalez to veto the bill after it passed through Puerto Rico's legislatures.

    "summary": "A groundbreaking IVF trial has raised hope that women with genetic mutations in their own DNA could one day have children without passing on deadly diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Eight healthy babies have been born in the U.K. using a new IVF technique that successfully reduced their risk of inheriting genetic diseases from their mothers, the people behind a world-first trial said Wednesday.",
      "The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting.",
      "In 2015, Britain became the first country to approve an in-vitro fertilization technique that uses a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the egg of a donor \u2014 along with the mother's egg and father's sperm.",
      "Some have called the result of this process \"three-parent babies,\" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor.",
      "The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy",
      "Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old.",
      "The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which causes disease \u2014   was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease.",
      "This indicates the technique was \"effective in reducing transmission\" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said.",
      "The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said.",
      "Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise.",
      "Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as \"reversal,\" which is still little understood.",
      "It is \"a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,\" he explained.",
      "Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\"",
      "The new technique offers a \"very important reproductive option\" for families affected by \"devastating\" mitochondrial diseases, he added.",
      "While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016, after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case.",
      "Ethical concerns over embryos and \"designer babies\"",
      "Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France.",
      "Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered \"designer babies.\"",
      "An ethical review carried out by the U.K.'s independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was \"instrumental\" in conducting the new research, the council's director Danielle Hamm said Wednesday.",
      "Peter Thompson, head of the U.K.'s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which approved the procedure, said only people with a \"very high risk\" of passing on a mitochondrial disease would be eligible for the treatment.",
      "Ethical concerns have also been raised over the use of mitochondrial donation for infertility in Greece and Ukraine.",
      "French mitochondrial disease specialist Julie Steffann told AFP that \"it is a question of the risk-benefit ratio: for a mitochondrial disease, the benefit is obvious.\"",
      "\"In the context of infertility, it has not been proven,\" she added.",

    "summary": "The voting age in the U.K. will drop from 18 to 16 by the next national election in a bid to increase democratic participation, the government says.",
    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 Britain will lower the voting age from 18 to 16 by the next national election as part of measures to increase democratic participation, the government announced Thursday. The center-left Labour Party pledged before it was elected in July 2024 to lower the voting age for elections to Britain's Parliament. Scotland and Wales already let 16- and 17-year-olds vote in local and regional elections.",
      "Britain will join a short list of countries where the voting age is 16, including Austria, Brazil and Ecuador. A handful of European Union countries, including Belgium, Germany and Malta, allow 16-year-olds to vote in elections to the European Parliament, but not their national legislatures.",
      "The move comes alongside wider reforms that include tightening campaign finance rules to stop shell companies with unclear ownership from donating to political parties. Democracy Minister Rushanara Ali said the change would strengthen safeguards against foreign interference in British politics. There will also be tougher sentences for people convicted of intimidating political candidates.",
      "Additionally, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government said it will introduce automatic voter registration and allow voters to use bank cards as a form of identification at polling stations.",
      "The previous Conservative government introduced a requirement for voters to show photo identification in 2022, a measure it said would combat fraud. Critics argued it could disenfranchise millions of voters, particularly the young, the poor and members of ethnic minorities. The law ironically caught out the man who had helped to usher it onto the books, when former Prime Minister Boris Johnson was turned away from his local polling station last year after forgetting to bring his photo ID.",
      "Britain's elections watchdog agency, the Electoral Commission, estimates that about 750,000 people did not vote in last year's election because they lacked ID.",
      "Turnout in the 2024 election was 59.7%, the lowest level in more than two decades.",
      "Harry Quilter-Pinner, head of left-leaning think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the changes were \"the biggest reform to our electoral system since 1969,\" when the voting age was lowered to 18 from 21.",
      "The changes must be approved by Parliament, but Starmer's Labour Party currently holds an overwhelming majority of the seats, so it is likely to pass easily. The next national election must be held by 2029, but it could, theoretically, be called before that by the government.",
      "\"For too long, public trust in our democracy has been damaged and faith in our institutions has been allowed to decline,\" Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said. \"We are taking action to break down barriers to participation that will ensure more people have the opportunity to engage in U.K. democracy.\"",
      "Stuart Fox, a politics lecturer at the University of Exeter who has studied youth voting, said it's \"far from clear\" whether lowering the voting age actually increases youth engagement.",
      "\"It is right to help young people be heard,\" he said. \"But there are other measures which are more effective at getting young people to vote - particularly those from the poorest backgrounds who are by far the least likely to vote \u2014 such as beefing up the citizenship curriculum or expanding the provision of volunteering programs in schools.\"",

      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before dawn, in the Northern Hemisphere. Sometimes, however, the meteors can be seen at night as early as 10 p.m.",
      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the sun, NASA said, and in 1865, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli became the first person to determine this comet was the source of the Perseids.",

      "Jane's Addiction is taking their feud to court.",
      "On Wednesday, guitarist Dave Navarro, along with bandmates Eric Avery and Stephen Perkins, filed a $10 million lawsuit against frontman Perry Farrell, accusing him of assault and battery after an onstage altercation in September 2024. The same day, Farrell filed a countersuit, alleging a \"yearslong bullying campaign\" against him by the other band members.",
      "The singer claimed he was blindsided by the other members' decision to cancel the remaining 15 shows of the tour and break up following the 2024 incident.",

      "Dave Navarro is suing his Jane's Addiction bandmate Perry Farrell for assault and battery.\u00a0 (Getty)",
      "Farrell claimed Navarro, Avery and Perkins are to blame for the escalating tensions and violence that erupted during the band\u2019s tour.",
      "\"Navarro, Avery and Perkins apparently decided,\" the lawsuit stated, \"that Jane\u2019s Addiction\u2019s decades of success should be jettisoned in pursuit of a yearslong bullying campaign against Farrell involving harassing him onstage during performances, including, among other tactics, trying to undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing.\"",
      "Farrell alleged that Navarro and Avery actually assaulted him, turning the stage into a toxic environment, and said the situation went from hostile to defamatory when the other members of the band publicly accused him of struggling with mental health issues in the aftermath of the altercation.",
      "Meanwhile, Navarro sued Farrell for assault and battery following an incident that took place mid-concert during a stop on the band's reunion tour last September.",
      "In court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, Navarro, Avery and Perkins accused Farrell of assaulting Navarro both on stage and backstage on Sept. 13, 2024. They stated that they suffered financial losses after the incident led to the cancellation of the tour and their planned album.",
      "The guitarist filed the lawsuit against the band's frontman after an onstage incident last September.\u00a0 (Kieran Frost/Redferns)",
      "According to the documents, they claimed that they \"were forced to bring this action\" after Farrell \"ruthlessly assaulted Navarro onstage, mid-show, during the Jane\u2019s Addiction 33-date North American reunion tour.\"",
      "\"As if the pain and humiliation of the onstage attack were not enough, Farrell continued his unhinged barrage of punches backstage (collectively, the 'Attack'),\" the lawsuit continued. \"The Attack, which was virally viewed by millions of people worldwide, was brutal and unprovoked. It quickly forced the termination of the show and eventually the entire Tour.\"",
      "During the Sept. 13 concert, videos taken by fans showed Farrell approaching Navarro, seemingly upset. He shoved Navarro with his shoulder, then advanced on him. Navarro held him back with a forearm to his chest, but Farrell threw a punch before one of the band's techs intervened.",
      "The incident marked a \"terminal inflection point\" for Jane's Addiction, the documents continued, which was formed by Perry, Navarro, Avery and Perkins in 1985.",
      "The 2024 reunion tour marked the first time that the band's four original members had performed together since 2010. According to court documents, the reunion tour had sold over 100,000 tickets before its 15 remaining dates were canceled on Sept. 16, 2024, three days after the incident at the show in Boston, Massachusetts.",
      "The altercation took place during a 2024 reunion tour that included the band's original four members.\u00a0 (Etty Lau Farrell Instagram)",
      "Jane's Addiction announced the tour's cancellation in a statement that read in part, \"Due to a continuing pattern of behavior and the mental health difficulties of our singer Perry Farrell, we have come to the conclusion that we have no choice but to discontinue the current US tour. Our concern for his personal health and safety as well as our own has left us no alternative. We hope that he will find the help he needs.\"",
      "Per the lawsuit, Farrell issued a statement in a since-deleted Instagram post on the day of the tour's cancellation.",
      "\"This weekend has been incredibly difficult and after having the time and space to reflect, it is only right that I apologize to my bandmates, especially Dave Navarro, fans, family and friends for my actions during Friday\u2019s show. Unfortunately, my breaking point resulted in inexcusable behavior, and I take full accountability for how I chose to handle the situation,\" he wrote, according to the documents.",
      "At the time, Farrell shared a matching statement with Fox News Digital.",
      "According to the lawsuit, the band's new album was also derailed as a result of the incident. Per the documents, Jane's Addiction had completed two songs including \"Imminent Redemption\" and \"True Love,\" both of which were released as singles, for the planned 12-track record.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"It is now impossible, as a result of the conduct by Defendant set forth above (and through no fault of Plaintiffs), for the Band to complete a 12-track album,\" the documents read.",
      "In addition to assault and battery, Navarro joined Avery and Perkins in suing Farrell for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and indemnity and contribution.",
      "Dave Navarro, Stephen Perkins, Perry Farrell, and Eric Avery of Jane's Addiction are pictured in 2008.\u00a0 (John Shearer/WireImage)",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, Navarro's attorney, Christopher Frost, said, \"In 2024 the four 'original' members of Jane\u2019s Addiction came together, against all odds, with a new tour and new music. Persuaded by Perry Farrell to revive the legendary configuration of the band, Dave Navarro, Eric Avery, and Stephen Perkins had high hopes that they could capture the pure spirit of the band\u2019s early days and build on it.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "\"Initially they did, in the studio and onstage,\" Frost continued. \"But, as our lawsuit explains, they did so with a fourth bandmate who was by turns unwilling or unable to perform to a reasonable standard and who repeatedly threatened to derail the tour.",
      "\"Ultimately, with the attack on Dave Navarro seen around the world, Perry Farrell abruptly and unilaterally ended all the plans for a Jane\u2019s Addiction revival. He also left his bandmates holding the bag for an unfulfilled tour and record deal, as our lawsuit explains in detail. Dave, Eric, and Stephen never wanted it to come to this. But they have been wronged, want the accurate story told, and they deserve a resolution.\"",
      "Navarro, Perkins and Avery are suing Farrell for $10 million in damages.\u00a0 (Kieran Frost/Redferns)",
      "Meanwhile, a representative for Farrell shared a statement with People which read, \"This is yet another clear example of the group uniting to isolate and bully frontman Perry Farrell. The timing of this baseless lawsuit is no coincidence \u2014 it was filed only after they caught wind of legal action coming from our side.\"",

    "summary": "Scientists find that diet, especially ultraprocessed foods, has a greater impact on obesity than physical activity levels, challenging common weight gain assumptions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on the MAHA Commission's report on chronic disease rates in children and explains what is contributing to the obesity epidemic on 'Fox Report.'",
      "Obesity among adults continues to be a major public health issue in the United States and other economically developed countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).",
      "\"It's a mix of poor diet, high stress levels, lack of muscle and lack of frequent movement,\" Lindsay Allen, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Back in Balance Nutrition in Florida, told Fox News Digital.",
      "While both overeating and lack of exercise are often to blame, a new global study suggests that one factor far outweighs the other.",
      "YOUR DNA COULD BE STOPPING YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "Scientists studied more than 4,000 adults from 34 populations, ranging from hunter-gatherer communities to office workers.",
      "They analyzed each person\u2019s total energy expenditure (TEE), which is the number of calories burned daily, along with body fat percentage and BMI (body mass index).",
      "One dietitian says a mix of poor diet, high stress levels, lack of muscle and lack of frequent movement are behind rising obesity numbers. (iStock)",
      "When adjusted for body size, people across all lifestyles and income levels burned similar amounts of energy, even if their daily routines were drastically different.",
      "\"The differences in body fat that we see across populations likely aren't due to major differences in activity level or total daily energy burned,\" study authors Amanda McGrosky (from Elon University in North Carolina) and Amy Luke (Loyola University in Illinois) told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Rather, excess body fat is\u00a0likely\u00a0primarily the product of too many 'calories in,' or eating more calories than are burned.\"",
      "SCIENTISTS MAY HAVE DISCOVERED WHY THE POUNDS COME BACK AFTER LOSING WEIGHT",
      "People in more economically developed areas burned more calories, the researchers noted \u2014 but that\u2019s primarily because they tend to weigh more, and heavier bodies naturally burn more energy.",
      "Published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the study concluded that how much people eat plays a far greater role than the amount of exercise when it comes to putting on weight.",
      "The findings suggest that overeating is roughly 10 times more important than a lack of exercise in skyrocketing obesity rates. (iStock)",
      "\"Our analyses suggest that increased energy intake has been roughly 10 times more important than declining activity rates in driving the modern obesity crisis,\" the authors stated.",
      "Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, agrees with the adage that \"you can\u2019t out-train a bad diet.\"",
      "\"Exercise burns far fewer calories than people want to believe,\" Osborn, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"We\u2019re not gaining weight because we stopped moving. We\u2019re gaining because we\u2019re overfed.\"",
      "\"This latest data only confirms what I\u2019ve seen in my clinic: We\u2019re not gaining weight because we stopped moving. We\u2019re gaining because we\u2019re overfed.\"",
      "Allen pointed out that muscle mass should also be considered.",
      "\"Having sufficient muscle is what drastically improves metabolism and fat-burning capabilities,\" she told Fox News Digital, also emphasizing the importance of stress levels. \"People\u00a0who live in high-stress societies tend to be fatter because stress hormones change our metabolism and shift us into 'survival mode.'\"",
      "SCIENTISTS CAN DETECT JUNK FOOD CONSUMPTION IN BLOOD AND URINE TESTS",
      "Another finding involves ultraprocessed foods (UPFs), which have long ingredient lists that are often calorie-dense, shelf-stable and \"highly palatable.\"",
      "\"As more populations are exposed to increasing amounts of highly processed, highly palatable foods, we will likely see increases in obesity in regions with relatively low rates currently,\" the study authors predicted.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods are less likely to help people feel full, causing them to overeat, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Ultraprocessed foods tend to be easier to overeat due to their flavor and texture, and they also don't keep people feeling full, the study found.",
      "They are also more calorie-dense, meaning they pack more energy into smaller volumes, and are more easily absorbed, making it harder for the body to eliminate excess energy.",
      "\"Ultraprocessed foods are engineered to override our biology, namely our satiety signaling in the brain,\" Osborn told Fox News Digital. \"They also promote inflammation and shift our physiology to a state that favors fat accumulation over fat burning.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The researchers pointed out that physical activity is still important, particularly for cardiovascular health, mental well-being and longevity.",
      "Allen noted that people \"need to consider all the other benefits of exercise and shift the mindset away from how many calories they are burning (which actually doesn't work very well for weight loss) toward building as much strength and muscle as they can.\"",
      "People should consider the benefits of exercise beyond just weight loss, a researcher advised. (iStock)",
      "Osborn agreed, recommending \"progressively intense and challenging workouts\" \u2014 strength training in particular \u2014 to help boost the metabolic rate and facilitate fat-burning.",

      "However, Allen noted, when it comes to preventing obesity, the findings point to excess calorie consumption \u2014 particularly ultraprocessed foods \u2014 as the major contributing factor.",
      "\"If you\u2019re worried about excess body fat, focus on calories in,\" McGrosky and Luke advised. \"Especially over the long term, it\u2019s much harder to meaningfully change the total number of calories you burn than it is to change the number of calories you take in.\"",

    "summary": "Mental health experts discuss the hidden toll of the Texas floods that victims will face long after emergency crews leave. Dr. Sabrina Browne shares warning signs with parents.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Sabrina Browne, a Texas-based psychiatrist, explains what flood survivors might experience and how to know when it's time to get professional help.",
      "As rescue crews and volunteers work to clean up after the tragic flooding that violently swept through central Texas over the July 4 weekend, others are looking to help survivors and victims\u2019 loved ones mentally recover. Dallas-based pediatric psychiatrist Dr. Sabrina Browne spoke with Fox News Digital about what survivors and those close to victims could be grappling with.",
      "\"Tragedies like this, in a very literal sense, hit close to home, right? It\u2019s one thing when you see things playing out on TV, but when it happens in your community, it really affects your life on every level,\" Browne told Fox News Digital. \"The reality for these families is that once the camera crews are gone and once the aid organizations are packing up, they\u2019re still going to be living with the repercussions of this.\"",
      "There are several possible reactions people may have in the wake of a tragedy, like the recent flooding. According to Browne, one of the most common reactions is a loss of a \"feeling of safety\" and a \"sense of stability.\"",
      "\"You take for granted that you're gonna wake up in the morning, go about your day, you're going to come home to your house, right? And all of those things. And so they lose that sense of stability,\" Browne said.",

      "TEXAS FLOOD SURVIVORS LOOK FOR GOD IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY",
      "She added that along with this loss of stability, some people can experience anxiety, worry or even fear that another disaster is around the corner. The mental health professional also mentioned that flood survivors could experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and even survivor\u2019s guilt.",
      "Browne has unique experience in helping Texas families through tragedy, having supported families in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde school shooting, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School.",
      "Like the case of the Uvalde shooting, many of the flood victims in Texas were children. Browne spoke to the differences in treating adults versus children, emphasizing that \"kids aren\u2019t just little adults.\"",
      "\"When we talk about kids, that's a wide spectrum of ages and developmental levels,\" Browne said. \"A child who is 12 is going to be having a different experience than a child who\u2019s seven, right? Because they\u2019re more mature, they cognitively can understand things.\"",
      "Beyond their ability to understand what has happened, this could be a child\u2019s first time dealing with disaster and death.",
      "\"Oftentimes, kids are encountering [death] in the setting of losing a grandparent or someone where it feels removed from them. But when they're seeing their peers, other kids in camp, when school starts back up, starting school and seeing maybe their friends aren't there, that brings it to a very real level so that now they're having to wrap their heads around, what does that mean? And then they're also struggling with, is this something that could happen to me? And so that can add another layer.\"",

      "Texas professionals like Browne aren\u2019t alone in their work to help flood victims recover, Spring Health, a company focused on providing mental health solutions, recently committed $500,000 in free services for flood victims in Texas, North Carolina and New Mexico.",
      "\"Recovering from a disaster isn\u2019t just about rebuilding what was lost. It is also about caring for the emotional toll that follows. We want people to know they are not alone,\" Spring Health CEO April Koh told Fox News Digital. \"This program is here to ensure that those impacted have a way to access high-quality, confidential mental health support at no cost.\"",

      "When it comes to knowing if your child needs professional help, Browne told Fox News Digital that it comes down to noticing changes in day-to-day behavior. She said that there are reactions parents can expect to see, such as their child regressing and maybe wanting to sleep in their room to feel safe.",
      "\"If we notice that, you know, they're, they are not sleeping, they don't want to eat, they don\u2019t want to play, right? Those big shifts, that is a sign of we need to get them in to see somebody for more support,\" Browne said.",

      "\"This was an idea of the president,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt explained during a White House briefing Thursday in Washington, D.C. \"He spoke about it in May and directed his administration to review a reopening plan for Alcatraz if it is possible.\"",
      "TRUMP PUSHES TO REOPEN ALCATRAZ, BUT PELOSI AND NEWSOM DISMISS IT AS A 'DISTRACTION'",
      "After Trump\u2019s May 5 announcement about reopening Alcatraz as a working prison, Bondi and Burgum joined Fox News correspondent David Spunt to visit \"the Rock\" to receive a briefing on the site and assess the 91-year-old former federal prison's infrastructure.",
      "The visit, which included walk-throughs of the main cell blocks and off-limits areas normally closed to the public, was a fact-finding mission and not an official announcement of reopening.",
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt interviews Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum inside Alcatraz Thursday. The exclusive interview took place during their tour of the decommissioned prison. (Fox News)",
      "Bondi and Burgum spent several hours inspecting the crumbling infrastructure while discussing the island\u2019s potential for future federal use. They toured the prison and surrounding island, met with National Park Service (NPS) officials and directed staff to collaborate on a preliminary plan to rehabilitate the complex.",
      "The island is managed by the NPS under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior.",
      "If reactivated, it would be operated by the Bureau of Prisons, a division of the Department of Justice (DOJ).",
      "\"So many people remember Al Capone, but this isn\u2019t about the past. It\u2019s about what Alcatraz could be again,\" Spunt reported from the island. \"They believe, along with their boss, the president, that this may be the symbol of law and order this administration is looking for.\"",
      "Alcatraz operated as a federal prison from 1934 to 1963, originally operating as a military prison in the 1850s. The name derives from \"Alcatraces\" after Spanish explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala's 1775 exploration mission of San Francisco Bay. While its etymology has inspired debate, the Bureau of Prisons contends it most likely means \"pelican\" or \"strange bird.\"LEGAL EXPERTS SAY TRUMP CAN DEFINITELY REOPEN ALCATRAZ, BUT COULD FACE 'AVALANCHE OF LAWSUITS'",
      "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi listens as a National Park Service official leads her through a restricted tunnel during a private tour of Alcatraz Island Thursday. (Fox News)",
      "Alcatraz as a federal prison had a maximum capacity of 336 inmates, plus over 150 staff members and their families. At its peak in the early 1960s, the prison\u2019s operating cost per inmate was over $10 per day, nearly double the national average, according to Bureau of Prisons data.",
      "\"This is a terrific facility,\" Bondi said. \"It needs a lot of work, but no one has been known to escape from Alcatraz and survive.\"",
      "Bondi told Fox News the prison could theoretically hold a range of offenders, including \"violent criminals, federal predators and illegal aliens.\" She emphasized the symbolic value of its isolation and reputation for strict control.",
      "Burgum said the goal is to evaluate the feasibility of restoring Alcatraz to its original use.",
      "\"It\u2019s a federal property. Its original use was a prison. We\u2019re here to take a look at whether it can serve that purpose again,\" he said.",
      "The island poses serious logistical challenges. Alcatraz has no direct power or water lines from the San Francisco mainland more than a mile away, and over 1 million gallons of water per month were once ferried in. Restoration would also require major upgrades to meet modern codes, including ADA compliance, environmental regulations and approval from the Bureau of Prisons and federal courts.",
      "The DOJ this week sent letters to California sheriffs seeking information on undocumented migrants being released from state prisons. An administration official noted to Fox News Digital that while these letters reflect the DOJ\u2019s ongoing public safety mission, they are not directly related to the Alcatraz review.",
      "Alcatraz Island gets 1.5 million visitors yearly as a National Park. (Lea Suzuki/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)",
      "Not everyone is on board. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who represents San Francisco in Congress, called the initiative \"the stupidest yet\" from Trump.",
      "The administration has not announced a timeline for a decision. Bondi and Burgum will report their findings to the president before any formal steps are taken.",
      "After its closure in 1963 due to high costs and decaying infrastructure, Alcatraz reopened to the public in 1973 under the Department of the Interior. It is now one of the most visited national historic landmarks in the country, drawing more than 1.5 million tourists annually. That popularity could become a factor in any decision to return it to a secured corrections site.",
      "Alcatraz has long captured the American imagination. Between 1934 and 1963, 14 escape attempts involving 36 men were recorded, but the Bureau of Prisons maintains that no escapee ever made it to freedom.",

      "Airfields face a constant battle with wildlife. Birds, rabbits and even deer can wander onto runways, creating dangerous situations for aircraft and crews. Birds are the biggest threat. When sucked into engines or hitting windscreens, they can cause catastrophic damage. In fact, the threat is so serious that the U.S. Civil Air Administration once built a \"chicken gun\" to fire bird carcasses at planes to test their resilience.",

      "How robot coyotes work to scare off birds and animals",
      "Enter the robot coyote. The ERDC, in partnership with wildlife biologists Stephen Hammond and Jacob Jung and the USDA National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), has spent five years developing these unique machines. The idea is simple. Most animals instinctively avoid coyotes, so why not use that fear to keep them away from airfields?",
      "The first prototypes, Coyote Rovers, started as Boston Dynamics Spot robots. However, these proved too slow to scare off wildlife. The team switched to four-wheeled Traxxas X-Maxx motorized cars, which can reach speeds of 20 mph. Each vehicle carries a plastic coyote dummy, blending just the right amount of realism and intimidation, all for about $3,000 each.",

These early trials showed promise. The robot coyotes successfully deterred birds and other animals, helping to keep runways clear and safe.",
      "But the ERDC isn't stopping there. The goal is to make these robot coyotes even smarter.

      "16 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED IN MASSIVE DATA BREACH",
      "A phone with a Google Drive app on the homescreen (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Security: Strong protections, but user vigilance needed",
      "Google Drive employs robust security measures, including 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data at rest and in transit. Additionally, users can enable two-factor authentication and manage sharing permissions to protect their files. However, like all cloud services, Google Drive is not immune to security threats.",
      "Phishing attacks targeting Google accounts remain common, and attackers may exploit weak passwords or compromised credentials. Furthermore, some third-party integrations request extensive permissions, which could be misused if not carefully managed. While Google has experienced security incidents in the past, such as the 2018 Google+ data breach, these have not directly impacted Google Drive. It's important to note that most major cloud storage providers face similar risks, and Google provides tools to help users mitigate them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To stay safe, you should regularly audit account access, and use strong passwords. By taking these steps, you can significantly reduce your exposure to security risks.",
      "Privacy: Automated scanning and user control",
      "Google Drive scans files for malware and policy violations using automated systems. While this process helps protect users, some privacy-focused individuals may feel uneasy knowing that their files are subject to automated review. Google is transparent about these practices and states that no human reviews your content unless required by law.",
      "If you require higher levels of privacy, you can use additional client-side encryption before uploading files to Google Drive. This ensures that only you hold the decryption keys, further protecting your sensitive information.",
      "Google Drive share settings (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Internet dependency: Plan for offline access",
      "Like most cloud storage solutions, Google Drive relies on an internet connection to sync and access files. However, you can make files available offline using Google Drive's desktop app or by enabling offline mode in your browser. Planning ahead ensures you can access important documents even during internet outages or while traveling.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Upload limits: Consider your backup needs",
      "Google Drive imposes a daily upload limit of 750 GB per user. If you need to back up large amounts of data, you may find this limit restrictive, as uploads will pause once you reach the cap and resume the next day. While some competitors may not have explicit daily limits, they often enforce fair use policies or bandwidth restrictions. Be sure to compare providers based on your specific backup needs.",
      "Illustration of devices uploading data to Google Drive in the cloud (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Not a dedicated backup solution, but still useful",
      "It's important to recognize that Google Drive is primarily designed for file storage and synchronization, not as a comprehensive backup tool. It lacks some advanced backup features, such as scheduled backups, full system image recovery, and granular file versioning for all file types. However, you can enhance its capabilities by using third-party backup software that integrates with Google Drive, allowing for more automated and reliable backups.",
      "An image of remote servers (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Is Google Drive right for you?",

By understanding its strengths and potential risks, and by taking proactive security measures, you can use Google Drive safely and effectively.",
      "If you need advanced backup features or require strict privacy controls, consider supplementing Google Drive with specialized backup software or exploring\u00a0alternative cloud storage providers. Ultimately, the best solution depends on your unique requirements and how you choose to manage your data.",

      "After that, dockside testing begins. The habitat is placed in water beside a dock for gradual submersion, which makes it easy to test for water-tightness and electrical safety.",
      "Finally, the team conducts full underwater testing. In this phase, Vanguard operates on the seafloor and receives air, power, water, and communications from the surface. This final step offers key feedback on how people live and work in the habitat, helping DEEP improve Vanguard and design the larger Sentinel system.",
      "Vanguard underwater habitat test schedule. (Deep)",

      "The team\u2019s innovation involves fitting darkling beetles, or Zophobas morio, their scientific name, with microchip backpacks that deliver small electrical signals to guide their movement. These signals stimulate either the beetle\u2019s antennae or their hardened forewings, prompting them to turn, stop or climb. The researchers even demonstrated real-time control using a standard video game controller.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Robots at this scale still struggle with climbing vertical surfaces and navigating uneven terrain. These beetles, on the other hand, are naturally built for it. Their footpads and sensory systems let them crawl through narrow cracks and over rubble. This makes them well-suited for the unpredictable conditions found in disaster zones.",

      "Data review by humans:\u00a0Conversations with Gemini may be reviewed and annotated by human reviewers for quality control and AI training purposes. Even if your activity is deleted, data reviewed by humans can be retained for up to three years, and this data is disconnected from your Google Account before review. Avoid sharing confidential or sensitive information in Gemini chats, as Google explicitly advises against it.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While some users may welcome this change, if you value control and transparency over your data, limiting its access is the best option. Unfortunately, Google's guidance on the subject is murky, and you can\u2019t fully disable Gemini on Android unless you root your Android phone.

      "What if the answer to cleaner energy was right out on the waves? A new green energy system is set to change how we capture clean power, and it all starts with the ocean. French startup Seaturns has designed technology that taps into the natural motion of the sea. Their water pendulum turbines are built to last, require little maintenance, and turn rolling waves into electricity. Unlike other renewable options, ocean waves offer a steady, often predictable source of power.",

      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "How renewable wave energy works using a water pendulum system",
      "Here's how the water pendulum wave converter works. These large, yellow, floating cylinders pitch back and forth with each passing wave. Inside, the motion causes a column of water to swing like a pendulum, compressing air between two chambers and driving a turbine that generates electricity. This constant back-and-forth movement happens entirely within the hull, protecting components from corrosive saltwater and turbulent seas.",
      "Unlike older wave converters that rely on exposed mechanical parts, Seaturns' design is simple, reliable, and self-contained. Backed by organizations such as Bpifrance, Horizon Europe, and marine research institute Ifremer, the project has drawn support from across France's public and private sectors.",
      "Water pendulum turbines. (Seaturns)",
      "Renewable wave energy turbine passes open-sea testing",
      "Seaturns recently completed 18 months of successful offshore testing using a prototype built near Brest, France. Built at quarter-scale, the test demonstrated the system's durability and energy efficiency under harsh marine conditions. This confirms the power-producing concept as a promising alternative to traditional energy technologies.",
      "Historically, ocean power projects have struggled due to their complexity, cost, and vulnerability to damage. Seaturns' design addresses these weaknesses head-on. A water pendulum is driven by the horizontal motion of wave surges, allowing it to function efficiently even in shallower waters where wave height is limited. This enables performance in shallower depths, bringing the system closer to shore. Its compact size, modular construction, and simplified deployment process make it attractive for coastal cities, offshore industries, and island communities alike.",
      "And unlike wind or solar power, which can fluctuate with weather and daylight, wave converters can generate energy more consistently, though typically at lower output levels, even when skies are cloudy or winds are still.",
      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "Low-maintenance renewable wave energy designed to last",
      "Wave energy offers enormous untapped potential. According to some estimates, global oceans could theoretically produce more than 2 terawatts of renewable electricity using wave technology. That's enough to power a significant portion of national grids, potentially up to a third of the United States' energy demand, if fully harnessed, though real-world output would depend on many local and technical factors. Harnessing even part of Alaska's extensive coastline could significantly reduce fossil fuel reliance in remote communities.",
      "Recent academic studies have highlighted the promise of pendulum-based wave energy converters. Their ability to deliver direct mechanical-to-electrical conversion, combined with structural simplicity, makes them a viable path forward for clean ocean power.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Some people point out that wave energy still has its hurdles, like dealing with inconsistent wave patterns and currently lower power output compared to wind or solar farms. Even so, the Seaturns system could be a real breakthrough. Its tough design, simple upkeep, and environmental benefits make it a strong contender for future energy grids. As we keep searching for reliable and sustainable power, wave energy is starting to stand out. Now, the big question is whether creative ideas like water pendulums can help make wave power a key player in the global shift to clean energy.",

      "AI chatbots are quickly becoming the primary way people interact with the internet. Instead of browsing through a list of links, you can now get direct answers to your questions. However, these tools often provide information that is completely inaccurate, and in the context of security, that can be dangerous. In fact, cybersecurity researchers are warning that hackers have started exploiting flaws in these chatbots to carry out AI phishing attacks.",
      "Specifically, when people use AI tools to search for login pages, especially for banking and tech platforms, the tools return incorrect links. And once you click that link, you might get directed to fake websites. These sites can then be used to steal personal information or login credentials.",

      "What you need to know about AI phishing attacks",
      "Researchers at Netcraft recently ran a test on the GPT-4.1 family of models, which is also used by Microsoft's Bing AI and AI search engine Perplexity. They asked where to log in to fifty different brands across banking, retail, and tech.",
      "Out of 131 unique links the chatbot returned, only about two-thirds were correct. Around 30 percent of the links pointed to unregistered or inactive domains. Another five percent led to unrelated websites. In total, more than one-third of the responses linked to pages not owned by the actual companies. This means someone looking for a login link could easily end up on a fake or unsafe site.",
      "If attackers register those unclaimed domains, they can create convincing phishing pages and wait. Since the AI-supplied answer often sounds official, users are more likely to trust it without double-checking.",
      "Wikipedia page showing ChatGPT description on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI phishing attacks are already happening: Real-world example",
      "In one recent case, a user asked Perplexity AI for the Wells Fargo login page. The top result wasn't the official Wells Fargo site; it was a phishing page hosted on Google Sites. The fake site closely mimicked the real design and prompted users to enter personal information. Although the correct site was listed further down, many people would not notice or think to verify the link.",
      "The problem in this case wasn't specific to Perplexity's underlying model. It stemmed from Google Sites abuse and a lack of vetting in the search results surfaced by the tool. Still, the result was the same: a trusted AI platform inadvertently directed someone to a fake financial website.",
      "Smaller banks and regional credit unions face even higher risks. These institutions are less likely to appear in AI training data or be accurately indexed on the web. As a result, AI tools are more prone to guessing or fabricating links when asked about them, raising the risk of exposing users to unsafe destinations.",

      "AI chatbots often sound confident even when they are wrong. If a chatbot tells you where to log in, do not click the link right away. Instead, go directly to the website by typing its URL manually or using a trusted bookmark.",
      "AI-generated phishing links often use lookalike domains. Check for subtle misspellings, extra words, or unusual endings like \".site\" or \".info\" instead of \".com\". If it feels even slightly off, do not proceed.",
      "Even if your login credentials get stolen, 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Choose app-based authenticators like Google Authenticator or Authy instead of SMS-based codes when available.",
      "If you need to access your bank or tech account, avoid searching for it or asking a chatbot. Use your browser\u2019s bookmarks or enter the official URL directly. AI and search engines can sometimes surface phishing pages by mistake.",
      "If a chatbot or AI tool gives you a dangerous or fake link, report it. Many platforms allow user feedback. This helps AI systems learn and reduces future risks for others.",
      "Modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge now include phishing and malware protection. Enable these features and keep everything updated..",
      "If you want extra protection, the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Think twice before clicking on \"unsubscribe\" links in unfamiliar or suspicious emails. Some of these links are used in phishing attacks to confirm your email address or trick you into handing over personal information. If you're unsure, it's safer to use Gmail's built-in tools instead.",
      "For Android devices, Google Play Protect offers built-in malware protection and can automatically remove known threats. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. That's why it's important to add a trusted antivirus app.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/why-you-should-think-twice-before-joining-power-saver-program",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:00:42 -0400",
    "summary": "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on proposed changes to California's electric bills on 'Special Report.'",
      "Power saver programs are utility-sponsored demand response initiatives that help reduce electricity usage during periods of peak demand. These programs typically target central air conditioners (AC) and heat pumps, since cooling equipment drives spikes in summer energy demand. In exchange for incentives such as bill credits or rebates, participating homeowners allow the utility to temporarily adjust or cycle their HVAC systems on hot days.",
      "But it\u2019s not all that straightforward. I recently received an email from Leah, an HVAC professional based in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.",
      "\"I would like to see an article about the push for Smart Thermostats, and the convergence of the utilities' attempts to control air conditioning usage to conserve energy.\"",
      "He pointed to a growing push for smart thermostats and what he sees as an effort by utilities to take more control over air conditioning use, all under the banner of energy conservation.",
      "Let\u2019s discuss the power saver programs in detail, including their pros, cons and everything else you need to know.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER",
      "A smart thermostat (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How power saver programs control your AC",
      "Most residential power saver programs function by temporarily reducing air conditioner usage at participating homes during peak periods (usually summer afternoons). In most cases, the utility installs a control device on the outdoor AC unit\u2019s compressor. During a peak event, a radio signal from the utility will cycle the compressor off and on at set intervals. Legacy programs like Xcel Energy\u2019s Saver\u2019s Switch use this method.",
      "Another method utilities use is controlling thermostats. You\u2019re asked to enroll your Wi-Fi smart thermostat in a bring-your-own-thermostat program. During a demand response event, the utility or program operator remotely raises the thermostat setpoint for a few hours. This causes the AC to run less. Most of these programs allow you to override the change via the thermostat or app; however, emergency events may temporarily disable this option.",
      "Benefits of joining a power saver program",
      "Power saver programs provide several benefits for both participating consumers and the wider community. First, there are bill savings and incentives. Participants receive direct financial rewards, ranging from annual bill credits of up to $40 to up-front enrollment bonuses of $25-$100.",
      "These programs also result in collective demand reduction during peak times, helping prevent grid overloads and blackouts. By coordinating energy reductions across thousands of homes, utilities can avoid firing up expensive peaker plants or purchasing high-priced electricity on the open market.",
      "Reducing peak demand can also help avoid turning on older, more polluting fossil-fuel generators. That means fewer CO\u2082 emissions and lower air pollution on the hottest days, when health risks are already high.",
      "A smart thermostat\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Drawbacks and risks of power saver programs",
      "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
      "\"In New Mexico, where I live and work, our electric utility, PNM, offers a 'Power Saver' program. Customers can opt in to have a box mounted to their condenser, which disrupts the signal between the furnace and the condenser during peak consumption hours, effectively shutting it down,\" Leah tells me.",
      "\"It\u2019s not great for the condenser, and we often get calls from customers who don\u2019t fully understand what they signed up for and are confused when their AC stops working. Now, there\u2019s a push to gain access to Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats to achieve the same goal. They want to control our ACs.\"",
      "Understandably, many people are uncomfortable with utilities taking over their cooling systems, especially in extreme heat. Take the 2022 incident with Xcel Energy in Colorado. During an energy emergency, 22,000 smart thermostat users were temporarily locked out of adjusting their ACs. Many had never experienced a no-override event before and were understandably frustrated. While rare, these incidents raise valid concerns about control and consent.",
      "There are also technical concerns. Frequent short cycling of AC compressors can lead to increased wear and tear. Every startup strains the compressor motor, and repeated on-off cycles within a short period may reduce efficiency or shorten the unit's lifespan, although this depends on the system and the frequency of the events.",
      "HOW 432 ROBOTS ARE RELOCATING A 7,500-TON HISTORIC BUILDING",
      "Smart thermostats and utility control: What to know",
      "Some people enrolled in thermostat adjustment programs without realizing it. This leads to confusion and frustration when their air conditioning is unexpectedly limited. Often, this happens because smart thermostats come with default opt-in settings or vague incentive language that can be confusing.",
      "In Texas in 2021, many residents saw their smart thermostats rise above 78\u00b0F during an ERCOT conservation alert. They later found out they had unknowingly agreed to let utilities make temperature adjustments.",
      "Privacy and security concerns with smart thermostats",
      "These programs also raise important data privacy concerns. Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats collect and transmit sensitive information, including occupancy patterns, temperature preferences and when a home is likely unoccupied.",
      "Cybersecurity is another issue. Like any internet-connected device, smart thermostats can be vulnerable to hacking or malicious remote commands. So far, no major breaches have impacted AC demand programs, but privacy advocates say the risks are real and growing.",

      "7 things to do if you're considering power saver programs",
      "Whether you're thinking about signing up or are already enrolled, these steps will help you stay in control, protect your comfort and avoid unwanted surprises:",
      "Before you join any power saver or thermostat program, read the terms completely. Ensure you understand the extent of the utility's control, whether you can override changes and how frequently adjustments may occur. Always choose manual enrollment during smart home app setup instead of letting it enroll you automatically.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Use a Wi-Fi thermostat that makes it easy to override changes during demand response events. Many models let you opt out temporarily or permanently through the app or the device itself. Learn how to do this before a peak event occurs, so you're not caught off guard.",

      "Every tattoo starts with a single black dot. That tiny mark is the base for every design, no matter how complex. And now, thanks to a new AI tattoo machine, that dot is more perfect than ever. Welcome to the future of tattooing.",

      "AI tattoo machine (Blackdot)",
      "What is the Blackdot AI tattoo machine and how does it work?",
      "Blackdot is not just a new tool. It's a complete reimagining of how tattoos are created. This device doesn't look like a traditional tattoo machine. It's a sleek, robotic arm powered by artificial intelligence. It uses computer vision, lasers and a microscope to apply ink with surgical precision. The dots it places are about the size of a human hair. Blackdot is currently in studios like Bang Bang in New York City. It's designed to create ultra-detailed tattoos quickly, cleanly and with less pain than traditional methods. And yes, it still uses real needles and real ink. But the way it works is totally different.",
      "How the AI tattoo machine applies ink with precision",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. It's quiet. It's steady. And according to early users, it hurts a lot less. That's because the machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo.",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. (Blackdot)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why tattoo clients might prefer an AI tattoo machine",
      "Let's say you want a custom tattoo from an artist across the country. Normally, you'd need to travel, book months in advance, and hope the artist is available. With Blackdot, you can get that same artwork in your city, without ever meeting the artist in person. The machine can handle everything from ultra-sharp lettering to lifelike portraits. It can even replicate a child's handwriting or a piece of original art down to the tiniest detail. And if you're nervous about pain or needles, this machine might make you more comfortable than a traditional tattoo shop.",
      "How tattoo artists can benefit from AI tattoo machines",
      "Blackdot isn't trying to replace tattoo artists. It's trying to give them more options. Artists can license their work to be used by the machine. They control how many times a design can be tattooed. They approve the final work. And they get paid quickly. This opens up tattooing to painters, illustrators, digital artists, photographers and more. You no longer have to be a tattoo artist to get your work on someone's skin.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why some tattoo artists push back against AI tattoo machines",
      "Of course, not everyone is excited about this change. Some tattoo artists feel like a machine doesn't belong in an industry built on human connection and trust. They say machines can't replace the experience that comes from years of working with different skin types and guiding clients through the emotional side of getting a tattoo. They also worry about losing jobs, or about AI removing the \"soul\" of a hand-drawn tattoo.",
      "Some tattoo artists are exploring AI tattoo machines with curiosity",
      "At the same time, some artists are curious. A few have even tried tattooing side-by-side with the machine to see how it compares. One artist described it like watching a dinosaur stare at a meteor; he didn't think it would take over, but he knew it would change things. And in some cases, artists say the machine handles tedious jobs like fine lettering better than they can.",
      "The future of AI tattoo machines in salons, studios, and beyond",
      "Blackdot has big plans. It's not just focused on tattoo shops. The company wants to put machines in permanent makeup studios, high-end salons, barbershops and fashion stores. It also launched something called the Blackdot Gallery, where people can buy digital tattoo art that can be turned into real tattoos. You can even trade and collect tattoos the way you might trade digital art or collectibles.",
      "The machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo. (Blackdot)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The AI tattoo machine isn't here to erase tradition. It's here to expand it. It offers new ways to create, new ways to connect, and a more comfortable experience for people who have always wanted a tattoo but held back. But it also raises big questions about what we value in a tattoo. Is it the art itself, or the artist behind it?",

      "Using millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging, the same type of signal used in Wi-Fi, the researchers developed a system called mmNorm. There\u2019s nothing normal about this superpower. This technology allows robots to scan containers and generate accurate 3D models of the objects inside by analyzing how signals bounce back from hidden surfaces.",

      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "How robots detect damage inside boxes using mmWave imaging",
      "Millimeter waves are particularly effective at penetrating materials such as cardboard, plastic and even interior walls. When these waves hit an object inside a box, they reflect. The mmNorm system captures these reflections and feeds them into an algorithm that estimates the shape and direction of the surface of the hidden item.",
      "Unlike traditional radar systems, mmNorm accounts for a challenging property called specularity, which refers to the way radio waves bounce off shiny or angled surfaces, much like a mirror. By estimating the surface normal (the direction a surface is facing), the system's accuracy improves dramatically. The method combines reflections from multiple antennas that \"vote\" on the surface normal direction based on signal strength, improving the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The technology powering robots that detect damage inside boxes",
      "What makes mmNorm different is its clever use of physics. Instead of ignoring reflections that bounce away from the radar (as most systems do), it captures them to infer the shape and orientation of hidden surfaces. Lead author Laura Dodds explained that the system doesn't just track where a signal comes from. It also analyzes the direction the surface is facing. To do this, the MIT team used a robotic arm equipped with a radar unit. As it moved around a sealed box, it gathered multiple measurements, building a detailed 3D picture of what was inside.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Why robots that detect damage inside boxes are a game-changer for warehouses",
      "During testing, mmNorm achieved 96% accuracy in reconstructing complex items, such as power drills and silverware. That's a big jump compared to the 78% accuracy offered by similar systems. In a warehouse setting, this means robotic arms could inspect the contents of packages moving down a conveyor belt without unpacking them.",
      "It also opens the door for humanoid robots to roam warehouses and assess packages for damage or missing parts in real time. However, the technology does not work well for objects hidden behind metal or very thick walls, which limits some applications.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where else could robots detect damage inside boxes and make an impact",
      "Beyond warehouse automation, this technology opens the door to several other promising uses. In factory production lines, robots that detect damage inside boxes could inspect goods quickly and without opening packages, helping maintain high-quality standards.",
      "In assisted-living centers, the same approach might help ensure safety by checking the contents of containers without disturbing residents. Even in security screening, being able to see through sealed boxes could enhance threat detection without adding any strain on bandwidth since the system uses the same mmWave signals as existing technologies. The research team plans to further improve the resolution of mmNorm and boost its performance on less reflective objects, making it even more versatile for future applications.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "We may be entering an era where robots don't just move boxes, but they understand what's in them.

      "A woman on the phone with customer service\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How chatbots are changing customer service for businesses",
      "A chatbot is an artificial intelligence tool designed to simulate real-time conversations with users. It operates around the clock, doesn't require breaks and can manage a high volume of requests simultaneously. For businesses, that sounds like an ideal solution. It's no surprise that the chatbot market has surged from $370 million in 2017 to $2.2 billion in 2024. Many companies now rely on chatbots as the first point of contact for customer service. Despite the convenience, not all customers are on board.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why most customers still prefer human agents over chatbots",
      "While companies are excited about the speed and efficiency of chatbots, many customers are not. A recent survey found that 71% of people would rather speak with a human agent. Even more concerning, 60% said chatbots often do not understand their issue. This is not just about getting the wrong answer. It comes down to trust. Most people are still unsure about artificial intelligence, especially when their time or money is on the line.",
      "Customer service representatives (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS CHATGPT?",
      "When customers want a human agent instead of a chatbot",
      "Not every customer question is the same. Some are simple and quick. Others are more complex or personal. And that's where chatbots fall short. A recent survey showed that 47% of people were OK with a company using their purchase history for marketing. But only 9% were OK with the company using their financial information. That's a big difference. When things feel more sensitive or serious, people want a real person to help.",
      "New research compares chatbots to human agents in customer service",
      "To better understand how people really interact with chatbots and human agents, researcher Vivek Astvansh partnered with a large North American retailer and analyzed more than 500,000 customer service chats. The findings are detailed in his peer-reviewed study, \"Insights from Customers' Chats with Bots and Human Agents.\"",
      "The study found that most inquiries fell into one of six categories: orders, coupons, products, shipping, account issues and payments. When customers had questions about detailed or sensitive topics, such as shipping or payment issues, they were far more likely to seek out a human agent rather than rely on a chatbot. Astvansh's research also revealed that human agents were more effective at matching the content and communication style of the customer than chatbots.",
      "This similarity in language and topic focus led to stronger rapport between customer and agent. In fact, the closer the agent's responses aligned with the dominant topic of the conversation, the faster and more frequently customers replied. The data suggests that customers feel more engaged when they sense they are being understood, which is a key driver of satisfaction during service interactions.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How businesses can improve customer service with a hybrid approach",
      "So, how can businesses use these insights to improve customer service? Not every customer issue should be handled by a chatbot. Companies should determine the intent behind each inquiry before deciding whether it should be routed to a bot or a human.",
      "Human agents already know how to mirror a customer's tone and focus. For chatbots to succeed, they must be trained to recognize and adapt to customer intent and language patterns. While this doesn't come naturally to machines, it can be programmed using machine-learning models like those used in the study.",
      "If a company is investing in a chatbot system, it should track how well that system performs. Businesses should ask chatbot vendors to provide real-world data showing how their bots compare to human agents in terms of efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction. If the technology cannot meet a high standard, it may not be worth the investment.",

      "AI tools, such as chatbots, are helpful and are not going away anytime soon. But customers still want to feel heard and understood. That usually means talking to a real person.

      "Farmers everywhere are facing a tough reality. There simply aren't enough people willing to do the backbreaking work of weeding fields, and the weeds themselves are getting harder to kill with chemicals. Many farmers would rather avoid using herbicides, but until now, they haven't had a practical alternative. Kenny Lee, CEO of Aigen, puts it plainly: farmers don't love chemicals, but they use them because it's often the only tool available. Aigen's mission is to give them a better choice.",

    "story": [
      "Flock Safety CEO Garrett Langley believes technology will play a key role in the future of law enforcement.",
      "Tesla just rolled out something big: the Oasis Supercharger. This isn't your average charging station; it's a massive, solar-powered site in Lost Hills, California, that could completely change the way we think about fueling electric vehicles.",
      "Instead of relying on the traditional power grid, the Oasis runs on clean, renewable energy, showing us what the future of sustainable EV charging might actually look like.",

      "ENERGY-SUCKING AI DATA CENTERS CAN LOOK HERE FOR POWER INSTEAD",
      "The Oasis Supercharger\u00a0 (Tesla)",
      "Tesla delivers on solar Supercharger vision with off-grid charging station",
      "Tesla has long promised to integrate solar panels and battery storage into its Supercharger stations. CEO Elon Musk envisioned a network where most stations could operate off-grid, powered by renewable energy. While a few stations received solar upgrades over the years, most remained reliant on conventional electricity sources. Now, with the Oasis project, Tesla is finally delivering on that promise in a big way.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Inside the Oasis Supercharger: Tesla\u2019s largest solar EV charging hub",
      "The Oasis Supercharger is truly massive. It will eventually offer 168 charging stalls, with half of them already operational. The station is powered by an impressive 11 megawatts of solar panels, which include both ground-mounted arrays and solar canopies. These panels cover 30 acres of land, making it one of the largest solar-powered EV charging stations in the world. To store the energy generated by the solar farm, Tesla has installed 10 Megapacks, which together provide 39 megawatt-hours of battery capacity.",
      "What makes Oasis especially remarkable is its ability to operate completely off the grid. This means it can provide reliable charging even during power outages or in remote locations where grid access is limited. Tesla brought 84 stalls online just in time for the busy Fourth of July travel weekend, and the remaining stalls, along with a new driver lounge, are expected to open later this year.",
      "The Oasis Supercharger\u00a0 (Tesla)",
      "Why Tesla\u2019s solar-powered Oasis Supercharger is a game-changer",
      "This project is important for several reasons. First, it significantly reduces the strain on local utility grids by generating and storing its own energy. This makes the charging station more resilient and less vulnerable to power disruptions.",
      "Second, it proves that large-scale, solar-powered EV infrastructure is not only feasible but practical. As electric vehicles become more popular, the demand for sustainable and reliable charging options will grow, and Oasis offers a clear vision of how to meet that demand.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Tesla's Oasis Supercharger sets a new standard for the industry. It shows that EV charging stations can be fully powered by renewable energy and operate independently from the grid. This approach could transform how we think about fueling electric vehicles and help accelerate the transition to clean transportation.",
      "Regulatory challenges could slow future off-grid EV charging projects",
      "Despite this impressive achievement, challenges remain. Recent changes in U.S. legislation have reduced incentives for solar energy and battery storage projects. These policy shifts could slow down the development of similar off-grid charging stations across the country. As a result, the expansion of renewable energy and EV infrastructure might face headwinds in the near future.",
      "The Oasis Supercharger\u00a0 (Tesla)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Tesla's Oasis Supercharger really shows us what's possible for the future of EV charging. It brings together clean energy, smart technology, and real-world reliability in a way we haven't seen before. But with new regulations and so much demand for charging, it makes you wonder, will other companies and governments step up and build more solar-powered, off-grid stations like this? Or is Oasis going to stand alone as a rare example, while most charging stations keep relying on traditional energy?",

    "story": [
      "Yoseph Haddad criticized three 'Squad' members over their anti-Israel views. Haddad has become a well-known social media presence since the Hamas massacre against Israelis on Oct 7, 2023.",
      "Members of the\u00a0\"Squad\" are undermining coexistence between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East, Israeli-Arab activist\u00a0Yoseph Haddad told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Representatives of the Squad are trying to harm the coexistence and partnership that exist in the region between Arabs and Jews,\" Haddad said. \"I think it was [Alexandria]\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez herself who said she had no idea about the geopolitics of this region\u2014she\u2019s right. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib know exactly what\u2019s going on here, but they decide to lie and twist the facts.\"",
      "Haddad, the CEO of Together Vouch for Each Other \u2014 an organization founded in 2018 by young Israeli Arabs to bridge cultural and religious divides \u2014 has emerged as a prominent voice in Israel\u2019s public diplomacy efforts following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 massacre.",

      "\"The first group is what I call the useful idiots \u2014 people who have no idea what\u2019s going on but joined because it felt like the cool thing to do,\" Haddad said. \"Then there are the paid protesters. You see the same faces at different rallies holding different signs \u2014 sometimes it\u2019s about LGBTQ issues, sometimes it\u2019s pro-Palestinian, sometimes it\u2019s about internal American problems.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s always the same person, just a different outfit and a different sign,\" he continued. \"And the third group \u2014 the most dangerous\u2014are the extremists who\u2019ve come from the Middle East. Those are the ones we should be most concerned about.\"",
      "Haddad traced the rise of extremist voices in the West to waves of immigration and population displacement from conflict zones in the Middle East. While the majority of Muslim immigrants fled persecution in search of a better life, he said, a vocal minority brought with them the ideology of the\u00a0Muslim Brotherhood, effectively holding their communities hostage.",

      "\"Ostriches, when there is a danger and there is a problem, what they do is they stick their head in the sand thinking the problem will just pass because nobody will notice them,\" he added. \"And this is what the weak governments are doing right now, becoming like an ostrich. The only problem is that no one will skip them over, it will make it easier to chop their heads off.\"",

      "\"In real apartheid, like in South Africa, everything was segregated \u2014 transportation, hospitals, courts, sports, even walking on the sidewalks,\" Haddad said. \"But if you actually come to Israel and see life here, it\u2019s the complete opposite \u2014 180 degrees different.\"",
      "\"Stop speaking from a place of emotion \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what The Squad is doing,\" he continued. \"Start talking about facts. Then you\u2019ll realize that anyone who concludes Israel is an apartheid state is an imbecile.\"",

      "When asked what he believes the Palestinians ultimately want, Haddad pointed to slogans often heard at anti-Israel and antisemitic protests, such as \"From\u00a0the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" and \"There is only one solution: Intifada revolution.\"",
      "\"The majority of Palestinians do not want to live side by side with Israel,\" Haddad said. \"So when people talk about a two-state solution and question Israel\u2019s commitment, I say: Don\u2019t ask the Israelis \u2014 ask the Palestinians. You\u2019ll be shocked to find that many of them aren\u2019t willing to accept it.\"",
      "Haddad pointed out that history can be approached in multiple ways \u2014 through religious texts like the Torah for Jews, the Bible for Christians and the Quran for Muslims. Even those who are atheists can look to history books for evidence of the deep-rooted connection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel.",
      "Haddad argued that the Torah explicitly mentions the presence of Jews in Israel, tracing their presence back thousands of years. He also highlighted the Biblical reference to the birthplace of Jesus in Jewish Bethlehem, challenging the notion that Palestinian Muslims have a historical claim to the land before the Jews.",
      "Haddad noted that while Jerusalem is never mentioned in the Quran, the term \"sons of Israel\" appears more than 43 times. He also emphasized that the name \"Palestine\" was imposed by the Romans as a punishment for the Bar Kokhba revolt.",

      "Haddad highlighted that in 1947, Arabs had\u00a0the opportunity to establish a Palestinian state through the U.N. Partition Plan, which the Jews accepted despite receiving less land and fewer resources. However, the Arabs rejected the plan and opted to wage war. When the Jews emerged victorious, 156,000 Arabs remained within what became Israel. Sharing his personal connection to this history, Haddad explained that his grandfather was one of those Arabs who stayed and eventually became part of the Arab Israeli identity.",
      "\"It\u2019s either you accept the fact that Israel exists and is here to stay, or you continue with this cycle of bloodshed and death that we are trying to escape,\" said Haddad. \"But the ones who will suffer the most are you,\u00a0the Palestinians, whether in the West Bank or Gaza.\"",

      "\"The threat to use the snapback mechanism lacks legal and political basis and will be met with an appropriate and proportionate response from the Islamic Republic of\u00a0Iran,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei claimed during a press conference, according to a Reuters report.",

      "IRAN CLAIMS ITS PRESIDENT WAS INJURED IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE LAST MONTH",
      "The comments coincided with the 10-year anniversary of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was originally intended to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, but which some have argued was insufficient to adequately deter Tehran.",
      "Under the terms of the JCPOA, any signatory can unilaterally call up snapback sanctions if Iran is found to have violated the terms of the agreement.",
      "Though the U.S., which, alongside the U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia, signed the 2015 deal, was deemed by the U.N. and other JCPOA members unable to utilize the mechanism after Washington withdrew from the agreement in 2018 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Despite repeated calls by the U.S. to enforce snapback \u2013 which would legally enforce all 15 U.N. members on the council, including Russia, to reimpose sanctions on Iran \u2013 no one on the UNSC or JCPOA has yet taken steps to enforce the sanctions.",
      "\"I would say one of the few good things about the JCPOA is that it reverse engineers the veto in the sense that you really only need one of the permanent members to be able to do this,\" Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Iran orogram told Fox News Digital.\u00a0\"But why is no one doing it? It's because it's a risky move.",
      "\"I think it's a worthwhile move, but we have to be honest \u2013 it's a risky move,\" he added.",
      "Ben Taleblu explained that Iran\u2019s most likely response to the severe sanctions under the snapback mechanism would be its abandonment of the\u00a0Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\u00a0(NPT) \u2013 an international agreement that over 190 nations have signed, pledging either not to transfer weapons to another recipient by nuclear-capable nations, or not to develop atomic arms by non-nuclear nations, among other commitments.",

      "\"In a world in which Iran's most likely response is to leave the NPT, one has to be confident in at least the ability of military threats to deter Iran further, or at least the credibility of America's and Israel\u2019s, or the international community's, military options against Iran moving forward,\" Ben Taleblu said.",
      "\"The problem is the lack of a game plan. Has America provided Europe with a game plan, a road map for post-snapback?\" he added, noting there needs to be a much larger strategy for next steps should sanctions be reinforced.",
      "Though the U.S. assesses that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been stunted by up to two years, experts remain convinced that Tehran\u2019s atomic ambitions have not been deterred, and its ties to terrorist networks and adversarial nations mean it remains a top security concern.",
      "Trump has said he is still committed to negotiating with Iran on its nuclear program, though questions remain over how long he will continue to allow negotiations to drag out before a European nation like the U.K., France or Germany must step in to enact snapback sanctions not only before the October deadline, but before Russia takes over control of the UNSC presidency that month.",
      "Pushing through the snapback mechanism is expected to be a roughly six-week process.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have said they believe a ceasefire with Hamas is \"very close\" to being secured.",
      "It has been 4,000 days since Hadar Goldin, a 23-year-old Israeli soldier and budding artist, was ambushed and killed by Hamas terrorists during a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "His remains have never been returned.",
      "For his mother, Leah Goldin, the passage of time has only deepened the urgency. In a wide-ranging interview marking the grim milestone, she thanked President Donald Trump and his advisors for their efforts so far\u2014 and asked for them to ensure that no ceasefire, normalization deal or regional agreement moves forward without the return of her son.",
      "\"We are turning to and hoping that President Trump and his people \u2014 who understand this issue \u2014 will recognize that the real victory over Iran is to bring everyone home immediately and unconditionally. Hadar is a symbol, and the Saudis must make this demand on their side, because you can\u2019t speak of normalization while we remain in a state of abnormality.",
      "MARCO RUBIO HOLDS FIRST MEETING WITH FAMILIES OF HOSTAGES HELD BY HAMAS",
      "Hadar Goldin's body has been held captive by Hamas terrorists for 4,000 days. Goldin was killed by the terror group, who have held his body as a bargaining chip ever since. (Courtesy: Bring Them Home Now)",
      "\"These deals are a bluff \u2014 and this selective process is horrific. It\u2019s killing the families and the hostages. The further we go without bringing everyone back and ending this awful war, the more Hadar Goldins there will be. It\u2019s unbearable.\"",
      "Hadar Goldin was born to a prominent family of educators and raised on values of faith, service and compassion. Hadar was known for his gentle character, sharp intellect and deep artistic talent. He had just gotten engaged. In his free time, he drew portraits, wrote poetry and taught children with disabilities.",
      "He was serving in the elite Givati Brigade when, on Aug. 1, 2014, during Operation Protective Edge, Hamas violated a ceasefire \u2014 agreed upon hours earlier with U.S. and U.N. mediation \u2014 by launching a surprise attack. Hadar was killed and dragged into a tunnel inside Gaza.",
      "For his mother, that moment shattered not only her family\u2019s world, but also what she calls \"the Israeli military\u2019s sacred code.\"",
      "\"The IDF\u2019s ethos is never to leave a soldier behind,\" she said. \"But on August 28, 2014, Israel signed a ceasefire with Hamas without demanding Hadar\u2019s return. That broke something fundamental.\"",
      "Over the past decade, Leah Goldin has met with world leaders, lawmakers and military officials across the U.S. and Europe, seeking justice for her son and others like him. She points to U.N. Security Council Resolution 2474, passed in 2019, which obligates all parties to an armed conflict to return the remains of the dead as a humanitarian act and confidence-building measure.",
      "\"This is international law,\" she said. \"And yet Hadar is still in Gaza.\"",

      "Goldin credits the Trump administration for taking the issue seriously. \"When the resolution passed in 2019, it was Trump\u2019s people \u2014 Jason Greenblatt, Nikki Haley \u2014 who led the way,\" she said.",
      "Today, Goldin sees a rare opportunity \u2014 a convergence of diplomatic efforts with Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Gaza \u2014 to demand Hadar\u2019s return before any agreements are finalized.",
      "\"Saudi Arabia has enormous leverage,\" she said. \"They\u2019re leading the Islamic world. If they want normalization with Israel, then let them demand the return of Hadar and all of the hostages as a gesture of goodwill.\"",
      "She also praised Steve Witkoff, a Trump envoy on both Iran and Saudi issues, and urged him to connect the dots. \"He\u2019s in charge of the deals. He knows the hostages matter. Don\u2019t say you\u2019ll finish the business and deal with the hostages later. That\u2019s immoral.\"",

      "Goldin says she has lost trust in the Israeli government, which she believes has repeatedly sidelined her son for political convenience. \"It\u2019s the same people for 11 years, just in different chairs,\" she said. \"They sign ceasefires, they release terrorists \u2014 but leave Hadar behind.\"",
      "Since Hamas\u2019 October 7 massacre, Leah and her family have taken on a new role: advising and supporting the families of current hostages through the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, a group they helped build in the days after the attack.",
      "\"My son Tzur, who also served in special forces, said no family should go through this alone,\" she said. \"So we organized \u2014 gave them our contacts, our tools, our lessons. But it\u2019s painful. Because we\u2019ve seen this before. And we know how easy it is to be forgotten.\"",
      "She calls the ongoing hostage negotiations \"a nightmare of selection,\" where some are prioritized and others left behind. \"As a daughter of Holocaust survivors, this feels like moral collapse,\" she said.",

      "Insurers that offer health care plans through the Affordable Care Act are planning a 15% increase in 2026, the largest in seven years, according to a new analysis from health policy research group KFF. That means a family of three earning $110,000 a year enrolled in a silver ACA plan could potentially see their monthly cost jump from $779 to $1,662 in 2026, according to KFF. The finalized plans, including how much more people will be expected to pay each month, are usually published around August.",
      "The premium increase will likely come on top of the loss of enhanced subsidies, which helped people pay for ACA health plans by capping the costs at a certain proportion of their income. The subsidies, enacted during the Biden administration and extended through 2025, were not extended in the domestic policy bill Trump signed into law earlier this month. The president\u2019s bill also added more hurdles for people who get their health insurance through the ACA. \u201cThis is not a repeal [of the ACA], but it\u2019s certainly an attempt to move in that direction,\u201d one expert said.

      "Last August, the WNBA announced that Indianapolis \u2014 home of the Indiana Fever and Caitlin Clark \u2014 would host the league\u2019s All-Star weekend this season for the first time.",
      "Clark\u2019s home city was a logical choice for this week's star-studded festivities. During her rookie season last year, Clark had an incredible impact on the WNBA\u2019s business, single-handedly accounting for massive increases in merchandise sales, viewership and attendance.",
      "On Thursday, however, the WNBA\u2019s best-laid plans for a Clark-led All-Star weekend officially went awry, as Clark announced she would have to sit out because of a left groin injury.",
      "\u201cI am incredibly sad and disappointed to say I can\u2019t participate in the 3-Point Contest or the All-Star Game,\u201d Clark said in a statement. \u201cI have to rest my body. I will still be at Gainbridge Fieldhouse for all the action and I\u2019m looking forward to helping Sandy [Brondello] coach our team to a win.\u201d",
      "The injury is the third that has caused Clark to miss time during her sophomore season. She played in only 13 of the Fever\u2019s 23 games before the All-Star break because of quad and groin injuries.",
      "It\u2019s significant not only for Clark as a player \u2014 prior to this season, she had never missed a game in college or in her rookie year \u2014 but also for the league. While the WNBA has been steadily increasing in popularity, Clark still has an outsized impact on the attention she and the league command.",
      "Her previous injuries, for example, caused ticket prices to plummet on multiple occasions.",
      "Ticket prices to a June 27 game against the Dallas Wings fell by 40% after Clark was injured in the previous game, according to Front Office Sports.",
      "That drop was paltry compared to Indiana's June 7 game against the Chicago Sky, which has become one of the league\u2019s most anticipated matchups thanks to Clark\u2019s rivalry with Angel Reese. Ticket prices for that game \u2014 which was moved from the Sky\u2019s usual home arena to the larger United Center \u2014 fell by 71% after an injury to Clark in May.",
      "Her absence is also felt in TV ratings. In mid-June, the national audience for WNBA games fell by 55% while Clark was out, according to Nielsen. In nationally televised games featuring the Fever, ratings were down 53%.",
      "With Clark out, now it\u2019s the All-Star game that will be at the mercy of her absence.",
      "Last year, the game had a record 3.4 million viewers, a 305% increase compared with 2023, according to the WNBA.",
      "Tickets for last season were also in high demand, according to StubHub, which claimed that sales for the 2024 All-Star game were 13 times higher than the previous three years. The cheapest ticket, per StubHub, was $146 on the Monday before the game.",
      "This year, Clark\u2019s injury immediately affected the resale market.",
      "On Wednesday, Front Office Sports reported that the get-in price for the All-Star game on TickPick was $121. On Thursday, less than two hours after Clark announced she wouldn\u2019t play, the get-in price on TickPick fell to $72 \u2014 a 40% decrease.",
      "The full impact of Clark\u2019s injury on All-Star weekend won\u2019t be known until the weekend wraps up. (She\u2019s also not the only star who will be out, with Atlanta Dream guard Rhyne Howard and Phoenix Mercury forward Satou Sabally dealing with injuries. Reese's availability is in question after she missed Wednesday's game with a leg injury.)",
      "But as the league has observed multiple times this season, Clark's  absence can be as important as her presence."

    "story": [
      "Stephanie Nixdorf was at Disney World with her family in December 2021 when she got the call. A mysterious bump on her elbow was melanoma, her doctor said. Tests later showed it was Stage 4, with spots on her lung and two tumors in her brain.",
      "Nixdorf, 51, a mother of four who lives with her husband, Jason, in Davidson, North Carolina, began treatments immediately, and by January 2024 her cancer was abating. The Premera Blue Cross health insurance offered by her husband\u2019s employer had covered her cancer care, but in early 2024, when Stephanie\u2019s doctors prescribed a drug to battle crippling arthritis induced by her immunotherapy treatments, the denials began.",
      "\u201cI used to run, play tennis, be active,\u201d Nixdorf told NBC News. \u201cNow I can\u2019t even open a yogurt or grip a steering wheel in the morning.\u201d",
      "Premera Blue Cross, a not-for-profit licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association in Mountlake Terrace, Washington, is a leading health plan in the Pacific Northwest, serving 2.5 million people. For nine months in 2024, it denied repeated requests by Nixdorf\u2019s doctors to cover infliximab, an inflammatory arthritis drug they\u2019d prescribed.",
      "With his wife in agony, Jason Nixdorf had a chance encounter with Zach Veigulis, a former chief data scientist at the Department of Veterans Affairs who was co-founding a company to help patients battle insurance company denials. That company, Claimable Inc., built an AI platform that allows patients to generate customized appeal letters containing comprehensive assessments of clinical research on a drug or treatment and other patients\u2019 appeals history with it. The cost: around $40.",
      "When Nixdorf reached out, Claimable\u2019s site was not yet live, but its chief executive and co-founder, Dr. Warris Bokhari, offered to help write an appeal letter for Stephanie using they system they had developed.",
      "In mid-September 2024, she sent that 23-page appeal letter to Premera\u2019s chief executive and chief legal counsel, arguing that one of its own policies states it should cover infliximab, her records show. Her letter also went to the governor and attorney general of North Carolina, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor.",
      "Two days later, Premera approved the drug. \u201cI want to apologize that you have been waiting to receive treatment for nine months,\u201d the approval letter said.",
      "Nixdorf is one of a growing cohort of patients using artificial intelligence to battle health insurance denials. Several companies offer software programs that let patients create comprehensive appeal letters relatively quickly, with the help of AI. It scrapes the internet for every shred of evidence of drug efficacy and past appeals success in a fraction of the time it would take a human to do.",
      "Courtney Wallace, a Premera spokeswoman, provided a statement to NBC News on the Nixdorf case.",
      "\u201cThere was no intent to deny care,\u201d she said. Rather, Premera made a \u201cprocessing error involving a misapplication of policy and assignment to an incorrect physician specialist.\u201d",
      "Premera \u201cfell short\u201d in this case, Wallace added.",
      "Research shows the arthritis Stephanie was experiencing, if untreated, can cause irreversible joint damage and significant disability.",
      "Jason Nixdorf said he\u2019s relieved that his wife was able to receive coverage for a treatment her doctors prescribed, but he also feels angry over the ordeal and its consequences.",
      "\u201cNot only has the delay caused Stephanie permanent damage,\u201d he said, \u201cit will be a lifelong thing for her to deal with this arthritis. If we had gotten the OK in January, it could have been knocked out and done then.\u201d",
      "'People give up'",
      "As many patients and their doctors know, trying to gain insurance coverage for a drug or treatment can be a full-time and exasperating task. Comprehensive data on insurance company denials is unavailable, but a January 2025 study by KFF, a health policy research, polling and news organization, found that insurers participating in so-called marketplace plans under the Affordable Care Act denied 19% of in-network claims in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. Fewer than 1% of consumers appealed the denials, the research found, and when they did, over half the denials \u2014 56% \u2014 were upheld.",
      "In addition to the impact insurance company denials have on patients\u2019 health, they carry a financial cost. In a 2023 KFF survey, 39% of consumers who were having trouble paying their medical bills said denied claims contributed to their problems.",
      "Amid the fight over Premera\u2019s denials, the Nixdorfs and their doctors repeatedly tried to set up a case review by calling a toll-free number that was never answered by a human being, leaving messages that were not returned, faxing paper documents at Premera\u2019s request, and completing letters of medical necessity.",
      "Wallace, the Premera spokeswoman, agreed there had been \u201ca breakdown in communication\u201d in the Nixdorf case. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on providing a better experience for providers,\u201d she added.",
      "Nixdorf\u2019s documents show Premera\u2019s first denial came in February when the insurer said infliximab was \u201cnot medically necessary\u201d to treat her arthritis. A second denial in June characterized the drug as \u201cinvestigational or experimental,\u201d even though it is recommended for inflammatory arthritis by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Drugs and Biologics Compendium, a bible among oncologists. The third denial, in July, said infliximab was not Food and Drug Administration-approved.",
      "\u201cThey set the system up so people give up,\u201d Jason said.",
      "After the third denial, Jason requested Premera provide all the records relating to its decision. He and his wife became even more troubled when they received the materials, learning, for example, that the doctor used by Premera in what\u2019s known as a peer-to-peer review of the case was a specialist in internal medicine with no expertise in cancer or inflammatory arthritis.",
      "They also discovered the company contracted by Premera to do an independent review of their case \u2014 AllMed Healthcare Management \u2014 was led by Jeff Card, who had been director of clinical review operations at Premera for seven years until he joined AllMed in 2021, his LinkedIn biography says.",
      "Having his wife\u2019s case reviewed by a company overseen by a former Premera executive presented a conflict of interest, Nixdorf told NBC News.",
      "Premera\u2019s spokeswoman declined to respond to this criticism, saying \u201cAllMed is accredited by both the National Committee for Quality Assurance and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission.\u201d Premera\u2019s partnership with AllMed is \u201csubject to rigorous oversight, including quarterly reviews and audits\u201d by the insurer, Wallace said.",
      "AllMed did not return an email and a phone call seeking comment from the company and from Card.",
      "Veigulis of Claimable said the company\u2019s three co-founders, including Alicia Graham, wanted to understand why people who have access to health care don\u2019t receive it. Building their AI model that went live last October, they began with rheumatology and migraine and now cover over 50 life-changing treatments. Veigulis said roughly 1,000 denials have been overturned by patients using the Claimable model.",
      "\u201cWe see so many people who have met the eligibility criteria who pay their premiums on time that still can\u2019t access their health care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is wild.\u201d",
      "'You have rights'",
      "Tabitha Lee is a former paramedic working in rheumatology at Wilmington Health in North Carolina. Since January, she has handled prior authorization and insurance denials for the roughly 100 patients who come in each day.",
      "Denials have ramped up recently, she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of patients on medication for years, stable and well-controlled, and insurances were denying them,\u201d Lee told NBC News. Instead, the insurers would suggest alternative drugs that were on their approved lists, or formularies, she said. This was causing trouble for patients, Lee added, because \u201cchanging patients\u2019 medications can cause adverse reactions.\u201d",
      "Lee said she had tried filing appeal letters for patients but it was time-consuming to compile the scientific and clinical testing data on each case. In February, at the suggestion of a rheumatologist and adjunct professor at the Duke School of Medicine, she began filing appeals using an AI-generated system created by Counterforce Health, a nonprofit founded by Neal K. Shah, a former hedge fund manager turned health care entrepreneur and advocate. Shah is also chief executive of CareYaya Health Technologies, a nonprofit that connects college students pursuing health care degrees with families seeking care for aging relatives.",
      "At no charge, Counterforce generates customized appeal letters based on a patient\u2019s insurance policy and the current record of successful appeals related to the drug or treatment in question. The letters also go to insurance regulators in the patients\u2019 states to alert them to the denials, which Shah said they may not be aware of.",
      "\u201cDenials should be appealed, but we observe most people don\u2019t appeal because they are intimidated by whole thing,\u201d Shah said. His message to patients: \u201cWhen you get a no, please take the next step \u2014 you have rights.\u201d",
      "Lee said using the Counterforce software has helped her overturn denials. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten back approvals on the same day and the day after,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt definitely limits the time we have to spend formulating each denial letter and allows me to work more on initial prior authorization and patient assistance.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "When a magnitude-7.3 earthquake struck off southern Alaska on Wednesday, officials were concerned about a potential tsunami. It was local public media that helped relay a tsunami alert, Sen. Lisa Murkowski said.",
      "But now, looming GOP-led funding cuts are concerning media allies that local public broadcasters would be forced to downsize or shutter, damaging news operations and hurting locals\u2019 ability to get timely emergency alerts like the one issued in Alaska.",
      "\"Their response to today\u2019s earthquake is a perfect example of the incredible public service these stations provide,\" Murkowski, of Alaska, one of two Republican senators to oppose the cuts, said Wednesday on X. \"They deliver local news, weather updates, and, yes, emergency alerts that save human lives.\"",
      "More than 50 years after NPR and PBS first hit the airwaves, the two public broadcasters with hundreds of member stations face millions in budget cuts after Republican senators voted to claw back previously appropriated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which funds public media like NPR and PBS.",
      "The House cleared the measure after midnight Friday, sending it to President Donald Trump for his signature.",
      "Republicans have framed the spending cuts bill as part of an effort to target purported \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government-funded programs. GOP lawmakers have accused NPR and PBS of having a liberal bias, and in March, Republicans claimed that they were \"anti-American airwaves.\"",
      "But media advocates argue that the cuts would have devastating effects on the American media landscape and an especially harmful impact on rural Americans, who may rely more heavily on local NPR and PBS stations for local news.",
      "\"I think unfortunately this is cutting off their constituents\u2019 noses to spite NPR\u2019s face,\" NPR CEO Katherine Maher said Wednesday on CNN. \"It doesn\u2019t help anyone to take this funding away.\u201d",
      "PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger said in a statement after the vote that the cuts would \u201csignificantly\u201d affect PBS stations, saying they \u201cwill be especially devastating to smaller stations and those serving large rural areas.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our stations, which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts, will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d she said.",
      "'Death sentence' for local stations",
      "More than 70% of the government funding appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting goes to the 1,500 public television and radio stations, according to the company. (In contrast, NPR says it gets about 1% of its annual funding from the government, though it also gets about a third through member stations, which are partly government-funded to varying degrees. PBS says it gets about 15% of its funds from the government.)",
      "Patricia Harrison, the president and CEO of CPB, said in a statement that eliminating funding for CPB would force many local stations to shut down.",
      "\"Millions of Americans will have less trustworthy information about their communities, states, country, and world with which to make decisions about the quality of their lives,\" she said.",
      "The cuts would come as the number of local outlets in the United States continues steadily declining. A report last year by Northwestern University's Medill Local News Initiative found that newspapers were disappearing at a rate of more than two per week and that 3.5 million people live in counties with no local news outlets consistently producing content.",
      "\"This could be a death sentence for a number of local stations,\" said Tim Franklin, the initiative's director.",
      "NPR and PBS rely on a combination of federal sources, including the government and private donations. Media experts warned that local stations in more rural areas could bear the brunt of cuts.",
      "Stations in rural areas \"are more reliant on the federal funding because there is a smaller population for them to raise additional funds from and there's less of a commercial incentive to be there,\" said Kate Riley, the president and CEO of the nonprofit America's Public Television Stations.",
      "Some stations are already downsizing in anticipation of funding cuts.",
      "Shawn Turner, the general manager of WKAR Public Media in Michigan, said he has already had to lay off nine staffers in anticipation of federal cuts. About 16% of WKAR's budget comes from federal funding, he said.",
      "The cuts, Turner said, would affect the newsroom's ability to devote resources to deep dives into issues like the impact of tariffs on Michigan's manufacturing industry.",
      "\"We've been able to ask them to begin to do a deep dive in really understanding how that's going to impact the community so that we have that reporting ready to go,\" Turner said. \"Our ability to do that going forward is going to be limited.\"",
      "Local public broadcasters also play a key role in disseminating emergency alerts and timely updates during natural disasters, advocates say.",
      "There are no viable alternatives in some communities, and locals cannot rely on social media for accurate updates, said Clayton Weimers, the executive director of Reporters Without Borders in the United States.",
      "\"Going online is not a viable alternative because it is such a cesspool of false information, and that cesspool gets even murkier in times of crisis,\" Weimers said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday shot down concerns over the impact of public media cuts on safety.",
      "\"I am not sure how NPR helps the public safety of our country, but I do know that NPR, unfortunately, has become really just a propaganda voice for the left,\" she said.",
      "Trump signed an executive order in May directing CPB to cut funding for NPR and PBS, framing them as \"biased media.\"",
      "Maher, NPR\u2019s CEO, said Thursday that national programming makes up a quarter of programming of all stations, with the other 75% representing \u201clocal programming, local needs and other national programmers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure that we\u2019re available and relevant to the entire American public, regardless of where you sit and regardless of what your political beliefs are, and we\u2019ve been taking the steps from an editorial standpoint to better understand what audience needs are and have more voices on air,\u201d Maher said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press NOW.\u201d",
      "Local station leaders are also pushing back against the administration, some of them arguing that it is interfering with a free and independent media.",
      "\"I think that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created to be independent and free from political interference and that the U.S. government has no place meddling in the editorial decisions or punishing the editorial decisions of NPR and PBS,\" said Sage Smiley, the news director of Alaska public media station KYUK.",
      "Tim Richardson, the program manager for journalism and disinformation at the free expression advocacy group PEN America, called the new GOP cuts punitive.",
      "\u201cThese cuts are not about fiscal responsibility. It\u2019s once again about punishing independent journalism, independent outlets that don\u2019t adhere to the administration\u2019s narrative of events,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a viewpoint discrimination with the end goal of, you know, undermining editorial, editorial independence.\u201d",
      "White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields responded in a statement Thursday that \u201cNPR and PBS will have to learn to survive on their own\u201d without \u201ctaxpayer subsidies.\u201d",
      "Public media have faced threats from Republican presidents before, including during Trump's first term. Richard Nixon, for example, \"pounced on it almost immediately,\" said Victor Pickard, a media professor at the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "\"I think it\u2019s fair to say that every Republican president, save for perhaps Gerald Ford, has had somewhat of an adversarial position towards public broadcasting,\" Pickard said."

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Democratic strategists, elected officials and voters in South Carolina are already eagerly looking forward, hunting for the next leader of their party after their 2024 presidential loss.",
      "They haven\u2019t had to look far: Prominent Democratic officials have flooded into the state, which was the first to vote in Democrats\u2019 2024 presidential primaries, in recent weeks. Democratic Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Tim Walz of Minnesota, Gavin Newsom of California and Andy Beshear of Kentucky have all crisscrossed South Carolina so far this year, while Rep.

      "As potential candidates test themselves out in South Carolina, state Democrats are considering whom they want to see leading them into a post-Donald Trump era. In conversations with more than a dozen Democrats across the state, two themes emerged: They want someone ready to \u201cfight,\u201d but they also want someone who can appeal across party lines.",
      "And while the two concepts might have seemed like an implausible match in the past, in today\u2019s populist political moment, the pairing makes more sense.",
      "Tyler Bailey, a civil rights attorney and Columbia City Council member who attended Beshear\u2019s event here, said he\u2019s looking for \u201csomebody who\u2019s not gonna just come in there and just say I\u2019m not for Trump. It can\u2019t just be an anti-Trump message.\u201d",
      "There is \u201ca hunger of people wanting to see some real leadership on the Democrat side,\u201d Bailey added.",
      "Spoiling for a fighter",
      "Over and over, in interviews across the state, Democratic leaders had one word on their lips: fight.",
      "\u201cPeople want somebody who\u2019s going to fight,\u201d former Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison told NBC News in an interview following Beshear\u2019s Columbia event. \u201cIf there\u2019s a theme that I am constantly getting, it\u2019s they\u2019re tired of the party being a doormat for Republicans. They want somebody who\u2019s gonna give the Republicans just as much hell \u2014 if not more \u2014 and fight for them and their families and their communities.\u201d",
      "Harrison, who once chaired the South Carolina state party, said anyone without a case to make that they were strongly standing up to Republicans shouldn\u2019t bother hitting the campaign trail.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re coming here and your backbone is like a wet noodle or spaghetti, you might as well just not even \u2014 save your airfare,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "Christale Spain, the current chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, echoed Harrison, telling NBC News in an interview at the party\u2019s headquarters that this moment calls for someone who is \u201cgoing to fight back against the current MAGA Republicans. We\u2019re looking for a leader that is a fighter.\u201d",
      "Spain added that the desire for a \u201cfighter\u201d has \u201cbeen clear to me for the last few months, just going around the state myself, talking to voters and seeing how they respond to different things.\u201d",
      "Governors who have visited the state have consistently rebuked Trump, positioning themselves against his tariff agenda, against his cuts to the federal workforce and against the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d the massive GOP domestic policy package that congressional Republicans passed earlier this month.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d Beshear told union members at the South Carolina AFL-CIO\u2019s annual convention in Greenville. \u201cWhat Trump and his congressional enablers have just done is a direct attack on rural America and on Southerners like us. It is a betrayal.\u201d",
      "Speaking across party lines",
      "Beyond looking for a fighter at this moment, Democrats in South Carolina are also looking ahead to a post-Trump era, when dozens of national Democratic leaders seem poised to throw their hat in the ring in a 2028 presidential primary.",
      "And former South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges, the last Democrat to serve in the state\u2019s governor\u2019s mansion, summed up what he thought his fellow primary voters should be looking for: someone who \u201cknows how to win.\u201d",
      "For a lot of Democrats who spoke to NBC News, that means a focus on who can draw in voters of all political stripes.",
      "\u201cI hear several things consistently. \u2026 It\u2019s critically important that we choose well in this next election cycle, whether we pick somebody who can draw independent voters, rally the base and get some Republican votes,\u201d Hodges told NBC News in an interview following Beshear\u2019s Wednesday meet-and-greet.",
      "Towner Magill, a Democrat who attended Beshear\u2019s meet-and-greet in Charleston on Thursday, echoed Hodges.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m looking for a uniter, not just in the Democratic Party. I think we need to run a uniter, but I also think that maybe we need a uniter in the White House,\u201d Magill told NBC News.",
      "A call for plainer language and clearer issues",
      "Many Democrats in South Carolina said that to unite voters across party lines, Democratic leaders have to remain laser-focused on certain issues.",
      "\u201cWe stopped talking about issues that, you know, that working-class folks care about: jobs, health care, education, community safety,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we did more poorly with working-class voters \u2014 white, Black, Latino \u2014 because we stopped talking about the issues they cared about.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere needs to be an adjustment in our message to addressing the concerns that they have about their own lives,\u201d the former governor added.",
      "State Sen. Tameika Isaac Devine called the messaging she\u2019s hoping to hear from potential Democratic candidates a focus on \u201creal things.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I think most people are looking for is somebody who actually they feel like is speaking to them about real things,\u201d Isaac Devine told NBC News after Beshear\u2019s Columbia event.",
      "South Carolina Democrats want leaders who are \u201cspeaking real things, and not just \u2026 the culture wars or the political correct terms, but actually can talk to what their pain point is. They want people who are going to give solutions,\u201d Isaac Devine added.",
      "South Carolinians aren\u2019t alone in that desire. Other rising Democratic leaders, including freshman Sens. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Ruben Gallego of Arizona have also called for Democrats to stop using words like \u201coligarchy\u201d or what Gallego calls \u201cIvy League-tested terms\u201d \u2014 though Bernie Sanders pushed back on the criticism of his anti-oligarchy activism.",
      "Harrison pointed to the constant push for Democrats to use certain inclusive or technical language as a reason why some voters may have viewed Democratic candidates as inauthentic.",
      "\u201cFor so long, I feel like Democrats, we put ourselves in straitjackets in terms of our language and how we talk to people and how we connect with folks,\u201d Harrison said.",
      "\u201cWe have to let our authentic selves step out. That means that we\u2019ve got to be willing to take risks. That means that we should not be shy about making mistakes, because that makes us more human and more relatable,\u201d he added.",
      "Bailey, the city council member in Columbia, pointed to character and relatability as something that could prove a major selling point for voters in his state.",
      "\u201cI think the relatability, people factor, is gonna be important. Because, you know, most communication is nonverbal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get a lot from somebody who\u2019s, for example, walks around scared, doesn\u2019t engage, doesn\u2019t talk, can\u2019t look you in the eye, can\u2019t shake your hand, seems, like, out of place eating fried chicken [and] would rather just have wine and cheese.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said Coca-Cola agreed to   start sweetening its products with cane sugar, rather than high-fructose corn syrup. Whether that will indeed happen remains to be seen; a Coca-Cola spokesperson did not confirm the president\u2019s assertion.",
      "Still, Trump said on Truth Social, \u201cYou\u2019ll see. It\u2019s just better!\u201d",
      "Is it, though?",
      "When it comes to potential health impacts, the answer is no, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University.",
      "\u201cBoth high-fructose corn syrup and cane sugar are about 50% fructose, 50% glucose, and have identical metabolic effects,\u201d he said.",
      "That is, both can equally raise the risk for obesity, diabetes, and high triglycerides and blood pressure. Both provide the same number of calories, but the body processes them differently.",
      "Whether from cane sugar or corn syrup, it's the fructose that appears to cause the most harm. The sugar is almost entirely processed by the liver, which converts excess fructose into triglycerides, a type of fat linked to heart disease.",
      "And unlike glucose, fructose doesn\u2019t prompt the body to produce insulin. Insulin triggers a hormone that helps a person feel full.",
      "Over time, too much fructose can lead to insulin resistance and increase the risk for Type 2 diabetes.",
      "Corn syrup does have slightly more fructose than table sugar, at a ratio of 55% fructose to 45% glucose.",
      "Dr. Melanie Jay, a professor of medicine and population health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and director of the NYU Langone Comprehensive Program on Obesity Research, said it\u2019s possible that switching from corn syrup to cane sugar may be beneficial on a population level.",
      "\u201cA 5% difference might mean that millions of people are getting less fructose,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like table sugar is a health food. Added sugar in whatever form should be limited.\u201d",
      "Sugary sodas have long been associated with obesity in children. A 2023 international study found that adolescents who drank one or more soft drinks a day had a higher prevalence of being overweight or obese, compared to young people who didn't drink soda daily.",
      "There are 240 calories in a 20-ounce original Coke, with 65 grams of added sugars. The current dietary guidelines recommend that teens and children limit added sugars to less than 50 grams a day.",
      "No matter the choice of sweetener, sodas generally fall into the category of ultraprocessed food because of their added sugars, artificial colors and flavorings. All have been targets of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., long an opponent of ultraprocessed foods.",
      "The HHS did not respond to a request for comment on the potential change in sweeteners.",
      "Is natural sweetener different?",
      "While all fruit contains some level of sugar, and some vegetables do, as well, that kind of natural sweetener isn\u2019t on the same level as added sugars in soda, Jay said. An apple, for example, does contain sugar, but it\u2019s also rich in vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals \u2014 and especially fiber.",
      "\u201cWhen you eat the apple, your stomach has to process it. The sugar isn\u2019t released into the body quickly, so you feel more full,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we drink soda, we\u2019re not getting that fiber, so the sugar is absorbed directly into our bloodstream.\u201d",
      "Does cane sugar taste the same as corn syrup?",
      "Would a change in sweetener alter the taste of an icy cold Coca-Cola?",
      "Discerning Coke-aphiles probably would notice a difference, said Mozaffarian. (He\u2019s on team cane sugar, by the way: \u201cI can\u2019t stand the taste of corn syrup.\u201d)",
      "Reducing sweetness overall, he said, is key. \u201cWe need to kick America\u2019s addiction for intensely \u2014 really sickly \u2014 sweet taste.\u201d",
      "Said NYU\u2019s Jay, \u201cit\u2019s always better to cut down on soda, no matter what the form of sugar is.\u201d"

      "I used plastic food containers for most of my life \u2014 they\u2019re affordable and accessible at most of the grocery stores I frequent. But, in recent years I\u2019ve learned more about the potential dangers plastic food containers and microplastics pose to my health and the environment. Leaching, which is the process of microplastic getting into food, is one of many reasons I recently turned to non-plastic food containers and cooking utensils.",
      "Harmful chemicals from some plastic food storage containers, like bisphenol A (BPA), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalates, can get into our food, especially when heated, according to Tracey Woodruff, an associate professor of reproductive sciences at the University of California San Francisco. \u201cThere are a lot of different chemicals that are used in the making of plastic or that are in plastic-related materials and these chemicals can leach from the plastic into people\u2019s food,\u201d says Woodruff.",
      "These chemicals can lead to an increased risk of infertility, reproductive health, cardiovascular disease and more, according to Woodruff. Additionally, researchers have found microplastics in several parts of the human body, including blood and the brain, according to Woodruff.",

      "Alternative materials: The best and most common non-toxic alternative to traditional plastic is glass, according to Woodruff. Unlike plastic, glass food containers aren\u2019t susceptible to leaching microplastics, making them safer to heat up, eat out of and prepare food in. Most of the food containers on this list are made of borosilicate glass, which is highly resistant to heat, thermal shock and cracking (though not shatterproof). Additionally, I also curated options that have ceramic coatings, which makes them stain resistant and nonstick, as well as containers made from stainless steel. While every container on this list is made from either glass or stainless steel, some of the included lids are made of BPA-free plastic and/or come with a silicone lining to prevent leaking, so some of the sets aren\u2019t entirely plastic free.",

As I mentioned above, chemicals found in microplastics are linked to an increased risk of adverse reproductive health issues in both men and women, lung and colon cancer, metabolic abnormalities, birth defects and more, according to Woodruff.

Plus, the containers themselves are durable and can handle high heat and travel without cracking. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about throwing them in my backpack, in the sink with other pots and dishes, or in the oven and microwave,\u201d says Rabinowitz. The set includes one large 6.3-cup container, two 3.5-cup containers and one 1.6-cup container in both round and square shapes.",

      "I\u2019ve had this glass set for about two months and I love everything about them. While the lids have plastic on them that isn\u2019t oven safe, the containers themselves are extremely durable \u2014 I\u2019ve baked multiple foods in them (rice, poultry and pasta) all at once in the oven around 400 degrees and they don\u2019t have a single crack. Plus, I baked them with the silicone cover on the bottom (to protect them from damage) and it didn\u2019t melt at all. The lids snap closed and don\u2019t spill, especially when I\u2019ve used them for foods with sauce. I\u2019ve also put both the container and lid in the dishwasher and they\u2019ve fared well and don\u2019t have any damage, even when I use hot water. Since the lids have plastic, I make sure not to microwave or bake with them on.",

The set has a 4.7-star average rating from 39 reviews at Klean Kanteen and includes a 1.25-cup, 2.8-cup and 6.8-cup container. The smaller containers fit on the inside of the largest container, so you can keep food separated, similar to a bento box, or simply use the largest one as is. Unlike many stainless steel food containers, this set is microwave- and oven-safe since its texture prevents sparking or arcing, according to Klean Kanteen.

While it\u2019s best for warm food, you can still use it to store things like salad and vegetables.",
      "How to shop for plastic food container alternatives",
      "Many plastic food container sets have chemical additives (many of which companies aren\u2019t required to disclose) with adverse health effects. This includes BPA, phthalates and PFAS \u2014 and those are only the handful of ones researchers know about, according to Woodruff. The easiest way to avoid leaching consequences is to simply avoid plastic food containers altogether. Here\u2019s how to find the best plastic-free container:",
      "Glass is arguably the best material to look for as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic food containers, according to experts. To a lesser extent, stainless steel containers can also be a reliable option. Glass allows for versatility since it\u2019s usually oven-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe, and isn\u2019t susceptible to leaching like plastic. Stainless steel doesn\u2019t always have these features, though it isn\u2019t susceptible to breaking or cracking and it often allows food to stay warm for longer. Also, many glass food storage containers have plastic lids, even if they\u2019re free of BPA, PFAS and other chemicals.",
      "If you plan on only using storage containers to prepare food \u2014 whether it be on the stove or in the oven \u2014 and then transfer food to them, then they don\u2019t need to be oven- or microwave-safe. If you don\u2019t want to have to dirty more dishes or transfer the food to a plate for reheating, then you should make sure that whatever you buy is microwave or oven safe. If you\u2019re someone who likes to meal prep and then freeze food, be sure to purchase something that\u2019s freezer compatible.",
      "In addition to buying new containers, Woodruff also recommends reusing store-bought glass containers, like those for condiments or sauces, to store food (not necessarily heat it), similar to how you would a mason jar. Doing this can help you save money and it reduces your single-use plastic consumption.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Leaching is what happens when molecular particles and chemicals in microplastics, like BPA and PFAS, slough off from plastic (in this case, food containers) and get into food, according to Woodruff. While this happens at any temperature, leaching is much more probable when you heat the plastic material, according to Woodruff. This is because heat agitates the molecules in the plastic, making them more susceptible to breaking apart. Additionally, some chemicals, such as BPA, leach more when you prepare acidic foods, such as tomato-based sauces, in them.",
      "Many people and organizations call PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because of how long they take to degrade and break down in the environment, according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Since these chemicals last so long they eventually make their way into food, water and animals, according to the EPA. From there, they can lead to health complications in humans, like infertility and cancer, according to Woodruff.",

      "Stacey Dash played Dionne, Cher\u2019s best friend, in \u201cClueless\u201d and in the sitcom spinoff, which aired on ABC from 1996 to 1997.

They form a singing troupe and leave Austria on the eve of WWII.",
      "A commercial and critical hit, \"The Sound of Music\" won five Oscars, including best picture, and draws an estimated 300,000 tourists to Salzburg annually, the area in Austria where the von Trapps lived and where the movie was filmed.",
      "To commemorate the milestone anniversary, NBC correspondent Molly Hunter spoke to Elisabeth von Trapp, one of Maria and Georg von Trapp's many grandchildren, at the villa where her ancestors first met.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m able to greet you here. It\u2019s like I\u2019m able to speak on behalf of my parents,\u201d Elisabeth von Trapp said. Her father, Werner von Trapp, is depicted as Kurt in the film, the second son of the family.",
      "The real von Trapp family fled Austria in 1938 \u2014 and not by crossing the Alps with their suitcases, as they do in the film. Instead, they took a train to Italy the day before the borders closed in Austria and ended up in the United States.",
      "Elisabeth von Trapp was born in Vermont. She had visited her grandfather's villa before, which is not the same house as the one used for the movie.",
      "\u201cWhen I came in 19, I think it was 1997, I had the most beautiful chance to visit with him here. He points up. He goes. That was my room where the shutters are,\u201d Elisabeth von Trapp said.",
      "The real Maria von Trapp died in 1987, but Elisabeth von Trapp remembers her well. \u201cShe was amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cHer enthusiasm, her imagination, her storytelling was amazing.\u201d",
      "She told Hunter that the film\u2019s depiction of Maria von Trapp was accurate \u2014 especially her relationship with the von Trapp children. She and Georg von Trapp went on to have three children together of their own.",
      "\u201cI think that was spot on,\u201d Elisabeth von Trapp said.",
      "Elisabeth von Trapp said her grandmother was \u201cso supportive\u201d of her career as a singer. \u201cShe came to my concert and just stood in line like everybody else,\u201d she said.",
      "Her musically inclined grandmother once got her the perfect present. \u201cOne time she said, \u2018So, what would you like for Christmas?\u2019 I said, \u2018You know what? I really need a new guitar case.\u2019 And under the tree was a new guitar case that she got me,\u201d she said.",
      "She remembered the first time she saw \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d musical with her family after first seeing the Broadway production. They drove an hour to a theater in Burlington, Vermont, she said, and as they walked down to their seats, audience members said, \u201cThere go the von Trapps, there go the von Trapps.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy mother, her eyes filled with tears,\u201d Elisabeth von Trapp said. \u201cMy father\u2019s just like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m looking at Salzburg. My parents were just overwhelmed seeing Salzburg.\u201d",
      "In a meta moment, Elisabeth von Trapp once participated in a theater production of \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d in Vermont.",
      "\u201cI did it for two seasons. Learning the script, the blocking, everything,\u201d she told Hunter. \u201cI did it in honoring (my grandmother). She had just passed away, so I thought I would do it as a memorial for her. And the second time, I\u2019ll do it for myself.\u201d",
      "Performing in the musical, she realized the story speaks to the human experience, beyond her own family\u2019s story: \u201cFinding love, being disappointed, making a big choice to go in one direction or the other.\u201d",
      "For the anniversary, Hunter also spoke to a few of the tourists in Salzburg who came to live out their \u201cSound of Music\u201d dreams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting, actually, because I\u2019ve seen it so many times, and to be actually here, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d one visitor from Australia told Hunter.",

      "The Steve Miller Band\u2019s decision to cancel its tour dovetails with other concerts not going ahead.

      "The two exes \u2014\u00a0who famously dated and then broke up while recording Fleetwood Mac's hit 1977 album \u201cRumours\u201d\u2014 recently began following each other on Instagram, a hint that the chill between them may have thawed since Buckingham was fired from the band in 2018.",
      "Nicks got things started July 17 by posting a handwritten lyric from the love song \"Frozen Love\" on her official Instagram and X accounts. She and Buckingham recorded the song in 1973 with their pre-Fleetwood Mac band, Buckingham Nicks.",
      "\"And if you go forward ...\" Nicks wrote.",
      "Not long after, Buckingham responded to complete the lyric in his own handwritten message. \"I'll meet you there,\" he wrote.",

      "The pair later ditched Fritz, became a romantic couple and launched their band Buckingham Nicks. Eventually, they relocated to Los Angeles together where by late 1974, they were invited to join Fleetwood Mac, which was then a British blues band.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham ended their romance while Fleetwood Mac recorded its 1977 album \u201cRumours.\u201d (Their fellow band members John McVie and Christine McVie, who had been married since 1968, also split around the same time.)",
      "Nicks and Buckingham poured their heartbreak into catchy breakup songs that went on to become hits, including \u201cDreams,\u201d written by Nicks, and \u201cGo Your Own Way,\" written by Buckingham.",
      "Over the years, Nicks and Buckingham would continue on in Fleetwood Mac together, although their personal relationship was often in tatters. Both also stepped away from the band at times to focus on their solo careers.",
      "They also traded plenty of jabs in interviews, with Nicks telling Rolling Stone in October 1997 that she \"resented\" that Buckingham wrote in \"Go Your Own Way\" that she was \"packing up, shacking up\" with different men since their split.",
      "\"He knew it wasn\u2019t true. It was just an angry thing that he said. Every time those words would come onstage, I wanted to go over and kill him,\" said Nicks. \"He knew it, so he really pushed my buttons through that. It was like, \u2018I\u2019ll make you suffer for leaving me.'\u201d",
      "A final behind-the-scenes incident with Buckingham at the 2018 MusiCares benefit gala held in Fleetwood Mac\u2019s honor was apparently the last straw for Nicks and resulted in Buckingham being fired from the band, the Los Angeles Times previously reported.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham apparently didn't speak again until a celebration of life for their former Fleetwood Mac bandmate Christine McVie, who died in 2022 at age 79.",
      "\u201cThe only time I\u2019ve spoken to Lindsey was there, for about three minutes,\u201d Nicks told Rolling Stone in October 2024.",

      "The highly anticipated start of the show\u2019s final season is jam-packed with Taylor Swift tearjerkers and gasp-inducing moments.",
      "The season opens with a four-year time jump. Belly (Lola Tung) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) are happily together at Finch University, while Conrad (Christopher Briney) is still on the West Coast, pursuing a career in medicine after graduating from Stanford.",
      "But in a shocking turn, Episode 1 ends with the reveal that after Belly and Jeremiah fought and \"broke up\" before spring break, he slept with a girl named Lacie \u2014\u00a0twice.",
      "From Heartbreak to a Proposal",
      "Belly learns about this months later at a fraternity party. Distraught, she throws up outside and tells Jeremiah their relationship will never be the same.",
      "\"She\u2019s, at the moment, feeling a little bit shattered,\" Tung tells TODAY.com in an interview about the Season 3 premiere.",
      "But the betrayal doesn't lead to a breakup. Episode 2 confirms that Season 3 \u2014 so far \u2014 is sticking to the plot of Book 3 in Jenny Han's series.",
      "After she learned that he cheated, Belly and Jeremiah reconcile with an engagement. But the proposal looks different on screen.",
      "In the book, their proposal comes shortly after Belly's freshman year. Season 3 slightly ages all the characters up, with the events of the first two episodes taking place at the end of Belly's junior year of college.",
      "Additionally, in the show, her decision to say \u201cyes\u201d to Jeremiah comes right after Belly\u2019s brother, Steven (Sean Kaufman), is seriously injured in a car accident.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s dealing with a lot of real feelings,\u201d Tung says. \u201cShe\u2019s realizing that things can be repaired with Jeremiah, and he is one of those people that makes her safe.\"",
      "\"When you lose someone, or almost lose someone, that can change things for you and bring you closer to the people in your life that really matter,\" she adds.",
      "Jeremiah's infidelity is notably Belly's second heartbreak at the hands of a Fisher brother. In Season 2, Belly and Conrad tearfully broke up on prom night after he was emotionally distant, leading her to assume he didn't want to be with her.",
      "\u201cThe heartbreak with Jeremiah probably feels like a little bit more like a betrayal,\u201d Tung says. \u201cJeremiah and Belly have been together for a lot longer.\u201d",
      "But both brothers, Tung says, ultimately have the same problem to work on.",
      "\u201cAt the heart of it is \u2026 miscommunication, which is a trait of the Fisher brothers,\u201d Tung says. \u201cI think both (heartbreaks) aren\u2019t because they don\u2019t love each other, but it\u2019s just because of miscommunication.\u201d",
      "The rest of Season 3 will come out over the summer, with a new episode dropping on Prime Video each Wednesday at midnight PT/ 3 a.m. ET until the season finale on Sept. 17.",
      "The official trailer previewed dramatic scenes, like Steven's car crash, and crushing heartbreak, including Belly running away from Jeremiah set to Taylor Swift's \"You're Losing Me.\" But it also teased that while Belly may be engaged to Jeremiah, things with Conrad aren't over.",
      "In fact, in a flashback scene in Season 3, Episode 2, Belly and Conrad coincidentally spend a wintry day together at the Cousins Beach house, leading her to realize, \"A part of me will always love you.\"",
      "Their day involved a \"Casablanca\" rewatch and completing a crossword puzzle \u2014 which many eagle-eyed viewers noticed involved a reference to Jenny Han's second book in her \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\" series. The answer to one of the crossword clues came from \"P.S. I Still Love You.\"",
      "\"Being a part of the Jenny Han universe, you always see little Easter eggs. I think it\u2019s so fun and cool that the movie exists in that world,\" Tung says.",
      "While we don't yet know whether Belly's final choice will be Conrad or Jeremiah, the official teaser subtly previewed what those great loves mean to Belly. At the beginning, Taylor Swift's \"Daylight\" played over scenes of Belly and Jeremiah in college, before abruptly shifting to \"Red\" when Conrad appeared on screen.",
      "\u201cJeremiah has always been that sunshine, golden retriever boy and I think 'Daylight' perfectly represents that,\u201d Tung explains of the song. \u201cThen 'Red' has this sort of intensity and passion that maybe is associated with Conrad, and they both represent the emotions that Belly feels for both. They\u2019re both equally strong \u2014\u00a0just different.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\"Stranger Things\" Season 5's official teaser trailer is here, previewing an epic showdown between the crew in Hawkins, Indiana, and the monsters within the Upside Down, led by Vecna.",
      "Introduced as the series' big bad in Season 4, Vecna is a grotesque, humanoid being with psychic supernatural abilities. But how he got that point is much more complicated, as explored in the play \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow,\" which opened on Broadway in April 2025.",
      "In the teaser for \"Stranger Things\" Season 5, which dropped July 16, Winona Ryder's Joyce and David Harbour's Hopper lead the group of teenagers in the battle against beings like the Demogorgon. Season 4, which premiered in 2022, notably ended with a gateway being ripped opened in Hawkins, leading to the Upside Down world. The final shots of the new teaser suggests Vecna himself will come through that barrier.",
      "\"Found you,\" Vecna, played by Jamie Campbell Bower, says in the chilling final seconds of the clip that teases the series' fifth and final season, which drops its first episodes in November.",
      "Vecna was introduced as the series' big bad in Season 4. It's revealed his real name is Henry Creel, and his telekinetic abilities made him the first of Dr. Brenner's test subjects. Creel is also known as One in comparison to Millie Bobby Brown's Eleven, a number used to specify their order as test subjects.",
      "Henry Creel is also the subject of the \"Stranger Things\" spinoff play, which first opened on the West End in 2023 before also moving to Broadway in 2025. The play opens with Henry as he starts his semester at Hawkins High School. There, he meets a high school age Joyce, Hopper and Bob Newby and strikes up a friendship, and eventual romance, with Bob's sister, Patty. Meanwhile, he has recurrent experiences in another dimension known as the Black Void, where he encounters Demogorgons and the Mind Flayer.",
      "While the play is a prequel, it was written to fit in with the established canon of the show, the play's writer Kate Trefry tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"I was kind of given free rein from there, within the very specific confines of the material that exists already, and then what's coming in Season 5, which is actually a pretty thin needle to thread,\" she says.",
      "Trefry was in the writers room at the same time as she was writing the play, so the stories are \"really in such conversation with each other,\" she says.",
      "Ultimately, viewers can understand Season 5 without having seen the play, and people can watch the play without having seen the show, according to Trefry.",
      "\"But I'm really excited to get a chance for it all to be taken in as a whole, because it's all connected,\" she says.",
      "\"There's so much connectivity that I can't talk about but there's so many Easter eggs on both sides, in the show and in the play, that are talking to each other and thematically, it's just all part of a piece of the same story,\" she adds.",
      "One major revelation of the play is that Joyce and Hopper knew Henry Creel before he was Vecna. In fact, Hopper was on the scene of the Creel family massacre. During \"The First Shadow,\" Hopper and Joyce team up to try and prove that Henry's dad, Victor Creel, was behind a series of gruesome animal murders haunting Hawkins.",
      "In Season 4, Nancy (Natalia Dyer), Steve (Joe Keery), Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Robin (Maya Hawke) investigate the 1959 Creel murders and realize that it wasn't Victor at all, but Henry, and they slowly connect the dots between him and Vecna. While this was happening though, Joyce and Hopper were in Russia.",
      "\"The sneaky thing that we had going for us with Season 4 is that anyone who knew about Henry Creel from the past ... is sequestered in other plot lines,\" Trefry explains.",
      "\"So we have the opportunity to say, they knew about this, and yet they were not available to the teens who have to make the discovery on their own,\" she adds. \"But it's all really a Jenga tower.\"",
      "And as deep as \"The First Shadow\" dove into Henry's origin story, there's still more to mine in Season 5, Trefry says.",
      "\"It was really working the fundamental origin story of Henry and building that into its own complete story, which was the luxury of doing an origin story, of saying you don't have to know who this person is to understand this story,\" she says. \"This is the beginning, and there's more that you'll find out in Season 5 about that beginning.\"",
      "For now, the show is only running on Broadway or the West End.",
      "\u201cI think one of the things that was really important to Kate (Trefry) and the Duffers (Matt and Ross Duffer) and Shawn Levy was how do we bring the same emotional and sensory experience that draws you into an episode when you\u2019re watching it into the theater,\u201d says Josh Simon, vice president of consumer products at Netflix.",
      "Simon, who\u2019s helped bring to life other \u201cStranger Things\u201d experiences like the merchandising of fictional brands from the show or the global \u201cStranger Things: The Experience\u201d tour, says after establishing the \"First Shadow\" theatrical experience on Broadway and the West End, the question now is: \u201cHow do we think about being able to create that same level of spectacle in a way where we can bring it all around the world?\u201d",
      "Simon says the goal is for \"as many people around the world to be able to experience it,\" but there aren't \"imminent plans\" for it.",
      "\"Right now, it's such a unique theatergoing experience, it leaves so many people wondering how do we do some of the things that we're doing,\" he says. \"And I think that's just an element that we really want to preserve.\""

      "In Season 1, Belly finds herself in a complicated love triangle between Susannah\u2019s two sons, Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) and Conrad (Christopher Briney).

On top of everything, Susannah (Rachel Blanchard) reveals toward the end of the first season that her cancer returned, and she doesn't want to go through chemotherapy again.",

      "After their initial breakup, the star-crossed lovers couldn't stay apart. They rekindled their relationship through long phone calls throughout the school year, until they were pulled apart again, causing Belly's connection with both Fisher boys to fracture. The reason for this huge rift remains a mystery when we catch up with Belly at the start of the season.",

Skye and Julia find it hurtful that Susannah chose to invite her friends to the beach house summer after summer without ever inviting their family. The house is, as a result, a sore point for this side of the family and something that Julia is eager to let go of.",
      "After their fun day on the boardwalk, the teens realize that Aunt Julia locked them out of the house while they were gone. So the crew takes a side quest to spend the night on a golf course, which they access thanks to Cam's mom's job at the Cousins Country Club.",

      "Iris: I missed the food. I missed In-N-Out. I missed just listening to music, to be honest. We can\u2019t listen to music all the time because we\u2019re mic'd up, so I felt like I just missed having my AirPods and driving. Little things like that were things that I definitely was thinking about a lot.",
      "Pepe: Definitely my dog, but I've got to also say family and friends because, if not, they'll be mad. The little things, like driving, listening to music and just walks on the beach. The small things that you take for granted and you're like, \"God, I hate being in traffic for an hour and a half, driving and listening to music.\" But when I was (at the villa), I was like, \"I'm excited to be in traffic.\"",
      "Pepe: For sure, for sure. (There weren't) a lot of low points, but ... for anybody that's done reality TV, or anything that is produced or where's there's a schedule and you're kind of just going through things \u2014 anything that has to be recorded like that, my respect went up for them insanely. Because I never thought it was this hard, but it is a lot harder than you could ever imagine.",
      "Iris: Yes, it is. I feel like it takes a lot. It takes a toll on your mind and body. But I feel like our experience at the villa ... we made the best (of it) and we had so much fun being there and meeting everybody and having a great summer.",
      "Pepe: Unique, fun, but hard.",
      "Iris: I haven't seen any of the episodes, so I haven't been able to really see what has not been shown or what's being portrayed. But I feel like I need to honestly watch it to be able to answer that.",
      "Pepe: I haven't been able to watch the episodes. I've just been with family and taking care of things now (that I'm) outside of it. Think a lot of the things were happening off emotions, inside and outside, which is normal. You grow an attachment to people and you grow a love for certain people. But it is part of it ... I don't think any of us could really be mad at what happened in there. I think we're all just happy to have been able to enjoy the experience.",
      "Pepe: I think at this point, everybody kind of knows we're together, obviously. They know it's very different than normal relationships ... it's just, continue to be with each other and focus on each other and just make sure that we can see this through.",
      "The villa was great. I kept saying it was the best week of my villa experience for sure. And now there's a lot of of ups and downs outside of the world. So, just play them out together and, honestly, just be there for each other no matter what. We were like that in the villa, so there's no reason to change that out here.",
      "Iris: And see what we're like without microphones and cameras and everything. We haven't been back home for that long, but the times that we have been together, I feel like we're really having fun.",
      "Pepe: We're just enjoying it.",
      "Iris: TJ is such an amazing guy. I've had a really strong connection with him and I think that he is the sweetest and he's everything. But, the whole time I was in the villa, I was just thinking, \"I don't want him to think I just moved on really quickly.\" I needed to have some closure with him for sure. That was definitely going through my mind. And the minute I got out (of the villa), I was like, \"We should talk.\" And we got the closure that we needed and we're great.",
      "Pepe: Same response. I think a lot of things end very quickly, right? So you should take the time and get that closure outside of this. You don't want feeling to be hurt, not inside, not outside. So, now that we're outside, you want to make sure that everybody's understanding and happy and that you can move on together.",
      "Iris: I feel so much love and I actually can't believe it. I'm definitely overwhelmed because I'm not used to it, but I feel really loved and really grateful and am glad people are seeing the connection that we have and they're enjoying it and seeing it for what it truly is. And that makes me happy.",
      "Pepe: Definitely. I think I can speak for all of us. We all feel loved because we didn't know what was happening. We went in there with no concept of what was going to happen, just going into this crazy experience to see what happens. And coming out knowing that we're all loved, we're all appreciated. We all have a have a huge support system, you know? Especially how it went down with America getting to vote a lot. We both came in the top four at one point. You just feel loved. That's crazy.",
      "Pepe: I think that a lot of things were done off emotion and it's just what it is. I mean, we did a lot of things off emotion in the villa, and you saw a lot of reactions off just straight emotion as well. It's tough. You grow these attachments with people and you want things to play out the way you want them to play out.",
      "I think a phrase that I kept saying in the villa that I learned in the villa is just \"Let things ride the wave. Let it ride out.\" You never know what's going to happen. So, I don't think anything was ever wrong. I think everything happened for a reason and it led to what it led to."

      "During the first challenge of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 7, Nicolas Vansteenberghe raised his hand, approached a blindfolded Olandria Carthen and kissed her. After, he held his hand to his chest as he walked away. Olandria, meanwhile, was left wondering who that was.",
      "For Olandria, that question wasn\u2019t definitively answered until 36 episodes later, in July 13\u2019s Season 7 finale.",
      "\u201cI just wanted the person to come forward and just confess, like, \u2018Hey, I was one that kissed you,\u2019\u201d Olandria tells TODAY.com in a joint interview with Nic.",
      "\u201cI was not standing on business that day,\u201d he chimes in.",
      "Nic and Olandria eventually found their way to each other, but not without the winding road that got them there. Early on in the season, Nic established a strong connection with Cierra Ortega, and Olandria with Taylor Williams. That all changed during Casa Amor, when the guys and girls were separated and introduced to groups of new bombshells.",
      "Olandria was dumped from Casa Amor when she failed to find a connection with a new islander, as was Nic for the same reason at the main villa. But instead of leaving Fiji, they were swept away in a getaway car, taken on a romantic date and given the opportunity to couple up.",
      "In Episode 21, they gave romance a try, even sharing a kiss outside of a challenge in Soul Ties. But they quickly decided they were better off as friends; it was clear other forces and unfinished business were at play.",
      "Though Nic and Cierra rekindled and became exclusive, Olandria and Taylor were hanging on by a thread after Taylor connected with a new islander, Clarke Carraway. Then Cierra abruptly left the villa in Episode 30, when social media clips of her using a racial slur resurfaced. (She since apologized.)",
      "So Nic and Olandria ended up in a couple once more for the final week of \u201cLove Island USA.\u201d What they thought was more of a platonic coupling eventually grew into a romantic one \u2014 a turn of events that delighted the corner of the internet who had been rooting for \u201cNicolandria\u201d from the beginning.",
      "Nic and Olandria were named the runners-up of the season, meaning U.S. viewers voted them the second most popular couple behind winners Amaya Espinal and Bryan Arenales. As for their relationship now, Nic said July 15 on the \u201cChicks In the Office\u201d podcast that, while they haven\u2019t labeled their relationship, they\u2019re \u201cdoing a lot of things that a boyfriend and girlfriend do.\u201d",
      "Below, TODAY.com caught up with Nic and Olandria to unpack their time in the villa, their first date, life back in the real world \u2014 and the hundreds of Nicolandria edits waiting for them.",
      "This interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Nic: I think through the edits you just feel the aura. Just aura. That\u2019s the first word that comes to my mind.",
      "Olandria: I love it. The edits tell our story beautifully, from beginning to end. And some of them even bring me to tears sometimes, like this is so beautiful. To know that we were unintentionally doing all this, like none of that was forced. We didn\u2019t even know Nicolandria nation was even existing \u2014 like, the producers did an amazing job of not telling us that information.",
      "We just kind of naturally gravitated toward each other toward the end of the experience. And it tells it beautifully through the edit. So I like to rewatch them.",
      "Nic: I think internally there was spark. But externally, I think we just had those connections still. She was coming off of Taylor, and then Cierra was at Casa. So I think with those doors being still open, we weren\u2019t able to fully invest in one another.",
      "Olandria: Definitely, when I was with this guy here. I\u2019ve been way softer. People are like, oh, she\u2019s more touchy feely. She touches him a lot. She seems like, more softer, more feminine. She doesn\u2019t have any guards up.",
      "What moment did I start feeling that? I don\u2019t know. I feel like I\u2019ve always been like that with Nic. He always made me feel so secure.",
      "Nic: I think one of the moments was near the end when we were reading \u2014",
      "Olandria: Oh, yeah.",
      "Nic: She was reading her sister\u2019s letter. I think that was the first time I\u2019ve seen Olandria cry ever. It was a happy cry. So I think that was beautiful, that moment.",
      "Olandria: I think they were both just confirming, like, \u201cWe want this. This has got to happen.\u201d You know, \u201cWe\u2019re so happy that y\u2019all are together. Y\u2019all don\u2019t realize how much support you have on the outside.\u201d I think that\u2019s when Ms. Jennifer offered me to come to dinner.",
      "Nic: It might have been even when my mom hugged her. I think the first question she asked was when are you coming for dinner. The reassurance from our parents, that was the most beautiful thing.",
      "Nic: No, I think up until that moment, obviously I\u2019m supporting whatever decision Taylor makes because I know the decisions he makes (are) from his heart. So leading up to it, I really didn\u2019t know. He invested a lot into both women and just going from his heart. So when he wrote down Clarke, there was nothing more to say to that than him following his feelings.",
      "Nic: I remember arguing with everyone, giving reasons. Standing on business, as they say, and convincing everyone. And it didn\u2019t take much convincing, it\u2019s like the facts are there. This is the person who deserves to have another chance in the villa.",
      "Olandria: I truly felt like all the decisions I made prior to picking Nic, I always considered everyone else in the villa. The person I had a connection with played a very, very big role into everyone\u2019s experience. Everyone loved Taylor. So I felt guilty if I ever wanted to step outside of that and make him seem single and vulnerable and risk sending him home, how the house would feel toward me. Because I feel like the guys were very emotional voters. So I didn\u2019t want to be on the chopping block just because I decided to send their best guy home. Taylor plays a big role within his life and Ace\u2019s life, you know. So I just didn\u2019t want them to have a sour taste in their mouth about me. So I always considered them.",
      "The women, too. Like (Taylor) and Hannah had an amazing bond. Him and Chelley had an amazing bond, too. So I was like, if I make this decision, how would they feel about me? How would they treat me? Because I have to live with these people. I don\u2019t have family here. I don\u2019t have friends here, other than them. So I always considered them while picking Taylor every single time.",
      "So I truly felt like the moment I decided to pick Nic, I didn\u2019t consider nobody but me. I know prior, with the Soul Ties kiss \u2014 the kiss that was heard around the world \u2014 even then, I felt like I owed so much to Cierra and Taylor at the time.",
      "So you know what? Regardless of how the world\u2019s going to view me, regardless of how these people are going to view me, I want this for myself, and that\u2019s just what I went with. I did not care about the noise.",
      "I see the tweets, \u2018Oh, my god, supposed to be a girl\u2019s girl.\u2019 I just blocked all that noise out and just went with what I felt, what I wanted to do. And I\u2019m so happy that I did.",
      "Nic: I felt like that moment was like a Super Bowl. Falcons vs. Patriots. I was down 28-3, and I came back for the win. That moment was grand.",
      "Nic: You know, it\u2019s been two days since villa. So it\u2019s a lot to process. I mean, not just the the Cierra thing, but also life and fans and Americans and just like \u2014 it\u2019s a lot to process. So just taking the time right now to process everything.",
      "Olandria: Absolutely, I felt all of the feels. It was so beautiful.",
      "Nic: You felt the flutters?",
      "Olandria: Maybe (laughs). I did. It was so beautiful. All I could do was just cry. And I\u2019m so happy. Even the viewers, they were even crying. I was like, bro, this is the most beautiful day. This is very perfect for them, because it\u2019s our first time actually hearing from America that you guys wanted this all along. So it was just so beautiful to see that.",
      "Nic: I picked her up over the water. Unlike some people. I\u2019m just kidding. I\u2019m joking.",
      "Olandria: He\u2019s messy. Stay offline.",
      "Nic: I think everything would have been different. I don\u2019t know exactly what it would be, but every decision we\u2019ve made has led us to here, and I wouldn\u2019t change anything about that.",
      "Olandria: No, I just wanted the person to come forward and just confess, like, \u201cHey, I was the one that kissed you.\u201d Well, he did \u2014",
      "Nic: I was not standing on business that day.",
      "Olandria: He was not standing on business. I was like, it felt scratchy. So I\u2019m looking around the room like, who has a scratchy beard?",
      "It\u2019s so crazy. He tells on the very last day of us being in the villa.",
      "Nic: It was the last week.",
      "Olandria: Why did you hold that secret? And he hates holding secrets. He cannot hold a secret to save his life. And he held that one."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s increasing turn against his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has inspired hopes in Ukraine and among its supporters that he is starting to believe what they\u2019ve been telling him all along: Moscow is the antagonist and the only way to stop it is with cash and military equipment.",
      "But while Monday\u2019s apparent U-turn was dramatic, other Ukraine supporters, former officials and other foreign policy experts are wary at least and deeply skeptical at worst.",
      "\u201cThe question that Europeans and Ukrainians are asking,\u201d according to Ivo Daalder, former United States ambassador to NATO, is \u201chow real is this change? And how lasting is this change? And what does it really mean in terms of American policy toward the region?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that the Trump administration has moved the goal posts,\u201d having briefly cut off aid to Ukraine in February, he said. \u201cSo there are a lot of questions here.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously lavished praise on Putin while scorning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But on  Monday in the Oval Office, sitting next to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, he said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the Kremlin and that the United States would sell \u201ctop-of-the-line weapons\u201d to NATO allies \u2014 including the much-demanded Patriot missiles \u2014 so that they can be used in Ukraine.",
      "Alongside that, if Putin does not agree to a peace deal in 50 days, Trump said, he will slap 100% tariffs on any country that buys Russian goods. That lag time has been criticized across Europe, with officials and experts asking why Trump is giving additional time to an autocrat who has hardly wavered in his desire to subjugate Ukraine.",
      "The anxiety is fueled further by the widespread perception in Europe and elsewhere that Trump is a president who makes decisions on a whim and is prone to changing them.",
      "Trump himself hinted at this propensity to change his mind quickly. He recalled going home one night and telling first lady Melania Trump, \u201c\u2018I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.\u2019\u201d To which she responded, \u201c\u2018Oh, really, another city was just hit\u2019\u201d in Ukraine by Russia\u2019s missiles.",
      "The exact details of Trump\u2019s new direction are as yet unclear.",
      "He said that the shopping list included Patriot missiles, the state-of-the-art American defensive system that Ukraine says it desperately needs to fend off Russia\u2019s nearly nightly aerial assaults.",
      "European NATO allies were going to buy \u201cbillions of dollars worth of military equipment\u201d from the U.S. \u201cand that\u2019s going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield\u201d in Ukraine, he added.",
      "The Patriot missiles could arrive in Ukraine \u201cvery soon \u2014 within days, actually,\u201d expedited by European nations giving their existing weapons to Ukraine and replacing them with the new systems delivered by the U.S., he said.",
      "\u201cThis is really big,\u201d said Rutte, a man who often heaps praise on Trump. \u201cIt will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, etc.\u201d He added, \u201cif I\u2019m Ukraine, I think this is really great news.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy, who has clashed several times with Trump and his team, posted on X thanking the president \u201cfor the willingness to support Ukraine and to continue working together to stop the killings and establish a lasting and just peace.\u201d",
      "Other endorsements came with caveats.",
      "The U.S. has \u201crealized that Russia does not really want peace, so in order to have peace, we need to support Ukraine and we need to put the pressure on Russia,\u201d Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday.",
      "However she suggested that waiting almost two months to impose tariffs was too long: \u201cFifty days is a very long time if we see that they are killing innocent civilians every day.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a view also held by Yuriy Boyechko, CEO and founder of Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization based in Roseland, New Jersey, that supports Ukrainian refugees in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis is way too long,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless significant pressure is applied on Putin and the Russian economy immediately, more innocent civilians will die.\u201d",
      "Russian officials mixed grave condemnation with mockery.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Trump\u2019s statements \u201cvery serious\u201d because it was \u201caddressed personally to President Putin.\u201d Whereas former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called it a \u201ctheatrical ultimatum\u201d about which \u201cRussia didn\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "A senior Kremlin official told NBC News that Putin may not rush to respond. \u201cWe need to analyze the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might take some time.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, the optimism of Ukraine\u2019s supporters will be dictated by what\u2019s actually in Trump\u2019s weapons deal \u2014 and whether he sticks with his renewed direction of thinking on the conflict.",
      "\u201cWe need to be a bit cautious as to whether this is a sea change in Trump\u2019s opinion or if it\u2019s just another part of a whiplash effect as he veers backwards and forwards,\u201d Matthew Savill, , director of military sciences at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute think tank, told NBC News\u2019 British partner, Sky News. \u201cHis overriding goal is to get credit for ending the fighting.\u201d",

    "summary": "Salt Typhoon National Guard",
    "story": [
      "An elite Chinese cyberspy group hacked at least one state\u2019s National Guard network for nearly a year, the Department of Defense has found.",
      "The hackers, already responsible for one of the most expansive cyberespionage campaigns against the U.S. to date, are alleged to have burrowed even further than previously known and may have obtained sensitive military or law enforcement information. Authorities are still working to discover the extent of the data accessed.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security memo from June, describing the Pentagon\u2019s findings, said that the group, publicly known by the nickname Salt Typhoon, \u201cextensively compromised a U.S. state\u2019s Army National Guard network\u201d from March 2024 through December. The memo did not say which state.",
      "The report was provided to NBC News through the national security transparency nonprofit Property of the People, which obtained it through a freedom of information request.",
      "The Department of Defense didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. A National Guard Bureau spokesperson confirmed the compromise but declined to share details.",
      "\u201cWhile we cannot provide specific details on the attack or our response to it, we can say this attack has not prevented the National Guard from accomplishing assigned state or federal missions, and that NGB continues to investigate the intrusion to determine its full scope,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "A spokesperson for China\u2019s embassy in Washington did not deny the campaign but said the U.S. has failed to prove China is behind the Salt Typhoon hacks.",
      "\u201cCyberattacks are a common threat faced by all countries, China included,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that the U.S. \u201chas been unable to produce conclusive and reliable evidence that the \u2018Salt Typhoon\u2019 is linked to the Chinese government.\u201d",
      "Salt Typhoon is notorious even by the standards of China\u2019s massive cyberspy efforts because of its ability to jump from one organization to another. Last year, U.S. authorities found that it had hacked at least eight of the country\u2019s largest internet and phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon, using access to spy on the calls and text messages of both the Harris and Trump presidential campaigns, as well as the office of then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "While part of the Department of Defense, National Guard units are also under the authority of their states; some are deeply integrated with local governments or law enforcement, which may have given the Salt Typhoon hackers the ability to compromise other organizations.",
      "The hack \u201clikely provided Beijing with data that could facilitate the hacking of other states\u2019 Army National Guard units, and possibly many of their state-level cybersecurity partners,\u201d the DHS report found. The National Guard in 14 U.S. states work with law enforcement \u201cfusion centers\u201d to share intelligence, the DHS memo notes. The hackers accessed a map of geographic locations in the targeted state, diagrams of how internal networks are set up, and personal information of service members, it said.",
      "In January, the Treasury Department \u2014 also a recent target of alleged Chinese hacking \u2014 sanctioned a Sichuan company for allegedly helping Beijing\u2019s Ministry of State Security conduct Salt Typhoon operations.",
      "Salt Typhoon can be pernicious and hard to root out once the hackers take hold. In the AT&T case, the company announced in December that it appeared as if they were no longer being affected and Verizon said in January it had \u201ccontained\u201d the incident. Both companies stopped short of saying they were fully protected from the hackers returning. A report from Cisco said that, in at least one instance, Salt Typhoon hackers remained in an affected environment for up to three years."

    "summary": "A study of more than 1 million people found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of autoimmune disease, allergies and autism.",
    "story": [
      "Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, who blame the ingredient on myriad health concerns. But a study of more than 1 million people, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread vaccine misinformation for years, said on a podcast in 2024 that aluminum in vaccines is \u201cextremely neurotoxic.\u201d (An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.)",
      "Senior study author Anders Hviid said that, as a parent, he understood the concerns about vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cOur study addresses many of these concerns and provides clear and robust evidence for the safety of childhood vaccines. This is evidence that parents need to make the best choices for the health of their children,\u201d said Hviid, who is a professor and the head of epidemiology research at Statens Serum Institut, a sector of the Danish Ministry of Health focused on combating and preventing infectious diseases.",
      "Hviid and his team used Denmark\u2019s nationwide registry to look for any connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions, and five neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD.",
      "The study looked at more than 1.2 million people born in Denmark from 1997 through 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Because health records in Denmark are meticulously kept by government agencies, the researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared those who received less. The study didn\u2019t include unvaccinated children.",
      "The researchers found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of the 50 conditions.",
      "Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said Scandinavian public health studies are of uniquely good quality.",
      "\u201c[This excellence is] partly because they have, for a long time, had such a unified health system,\u201d said Kedl, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study. \u201cEveryone is tracked for life from birth and you can go back for many years and ask, \u2018Can we find a link between something that happened in the past and in the future?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hviid said the catalyst for the Danish study was a widely criticized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded study, published in 2022, that suggested a link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and increased asthma risk. The study, however, didn\u2019t distinguish between aluminum from vaccines and aluminum from other sources. It also contained inconsistencies: for example, in one group the researchers analyzed, more aluminum exposure wasn\u2019t linked to increased asthma risk, contrary to the study\u2019s conclusions.",
      "\u201cIf you are looking at people who got vaccines that contained aluminum versus those who had fewer, you have to control for confounding factors, you need to know that the only different source of aluminum these people received was from those vaccines,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "The CDC study was not able to do that, Offit said. Aluminum is the third-most abundant metal on Earth and people are exposed to the metal through breast milk, air and water, he said.",
      "\u201cAluminum is part of our daily diet and has been since the beginning of time. That is the point people don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Neither Osterholm nor Offit were involved with the new study.",
      "CDC officials said at the time that it appears that aluminum-containing vaccines \u201cdo not account for the overall trends that we see.\u201d",
      "Osterholm said the strength of the broader research is that it piles on dozens of studies that have drawn the same conclusion as the new study.",
      "\u201cOne study does not make for a safe vaccine supply or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the accumulative data that comes from many studies that have been done, that together demonstrate the safety of vaccines.\u201d",
      "Why is aluminum in vaccines?",
      "Different ingredients are added to vaccines for different reasons. Aluminum \u2014 added to vaccines as aluminum salts \u2014 is what\u2019s known as an adjuvant. These additives act as a beacon for the immune system, pointing out invaders and prompting the body to produce antibodies against an antigen, or the virus or bacteria a vaccine aims to protect against.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just have an antigen and have an immune response, you need some kind of stimulus to trigger that response,\u201d said Kedl, of the University of Colorado. \u201cAn adjuvant is a substance that alerts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine\u2019s antigen. Without adjuvants, you actually create tolerance, which is the opposite effect of what you want a vaccine to do.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., aluminum salts are used in the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) as well as vaccines for pneumonia, HPV and hepatitis B.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum that is in vaccines is in the form of extremely small amounts of aluminum salts which is not the same as elemental aluminum which is a metal,\u201d Hviid said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for parents to understand that we are not injecting metal into children.\u201d",
      "Aluminum salts from vaccines are injected into the muscle and most are cleared away by the body and filtered out through the kidneys within two weeks, though small amounts can linger for years.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum-containing vaccines form the backbone of our childhood immunization programs,\u201d Hviid said, adding that there are currently no viable replacements. \u201cIt is critically important that we keep politics and science apart in this issue. If not, it is the children, including U.S. children, who are going to suffer the consequences.\u201d"

      "Harry has been a regular in British courts in recent years, challenging both his security arrangements and tabloid newspaper publishers for allegedly hacking phones and using private investigators to snoop on his life for news stories.",
      "Harry has also openly expressed his frustrations with his family, who were the source of pointed criticism in his best-selling book, \u201cSpare,\u201d two years ago, which saw him claim that he had been physically attacked by his brother William, the Prince of Wales.",
      "This came after Harry and Meghan alleged in a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey that a member of the royal family had expressed concerns over the skin color of their son, Archie, before he was born."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom in September along with first lady Melania Trump, where he will be hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, Buckingham Palace said in a statement Sunday.",
      "No American president has ever been invited for a second state visit. But Trump, a big supporter of the royal family, was hosted by Charles' late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in 2019.",
      "On this occasion, however, he will not stay at Buckingham Palace, which is currently undergoing renovations. Instead, he will travel to Windsor Castle, which sits around 30 miles to the west of London.",
      "Trump who shocked reporters and palace pundits in 2018 when he breached royal protocol by walking ahead of the queen, at times blocking her view and giving her his back, said it was a \u201cgreat, great honor\u201d when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hand-delivered the invitation during a visit to the White House in February.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s really something,\u201d he added.",
      "Second-term U.S. presidents who have already made a state visit to the U.K. normally take lunch or tea with the monarch, as was the case with Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Meanwhile, state visits are ceremonial meetings between heads of state that are used to honor friendly nations and sometimes smooth relations between rivals.",
      "Although the king formally issues the invitation for a state visit, which comes with a full display of pageantry and royal pomp, he does so on the advice of the government.",
      "The announcement comes as Starmer courts Trump's favor on tariff negotiations, which have thrown a wrench in the Labour government's efforts to grow the British economy after it contracted in April amid a record fall in exports to the United States.",
      "Trump last month lowered tariffs on the British aerospace sector to zero, but imports of British steel products continue to face a 25% duty.",
      "On his last visit to the U.K., Trump injected himself into British politics by endorsing Boris Johnson to be the next prime minister and weighing in on negotiations over Brexit. He also continued his public feud with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, branding him a loser.",
      "Charles could also face challenges with Trump on Canada, since he's also the head of state for the former British colony. Trump has on several occasions threatened to annex Canada and suggested it should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney criticized the state visit invite in May.",
      "In a speech to the Canadian Parliament in May, Charles highlighted the country's \"sovereignty\" and said it was facing a \"critical moment.\"",
      "\u201cThe true north is indeed strong and free,\u201d he said, referring to Canada's national anthem."

      "A 20-year-old American from Florida was beaten to death by Israeli settlers on Friday while visiting relatives in the occupied West Bank, according to his family and the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Sayfollah Musallet, known as Saif, was \u201cbrutally beaten to death\u201d in the town of al-Mazra\u2019a ash-Sharqiya, north of Ramallah, the family said in a statement on social media and confirmed to NBC News. According to the family, a group of settlers blocked an ambulance from reaching Musallet for about three hours.",
      "After the settlers cleared, Musallet\u2019s brother was able to reach him and carry him to the ambulance, according to the statement. However, \u201cSaif died before reaching the hospital.\u201d",
      "A second man, Mohammed al-Shalabi, 23, was also killed in the same incident, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers live in developments built in Palestinian territories that are widely considered illegal by the international community. Since October 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, sparking the war in Gaza, violence perpetrated by settlers in the West Bank has surged, often aided or abetted by Israeli security forces.",
      "Settler attacks include raids on villages, arson targeting homes and farmland, and physical assaults on residents that have regularly turned deadly.",
      "It is currently unclear why the confrontation that killed Musallet and al-Shalabi began.",
      "In response to a request for comment from NBC News, a State Department spokesperson said it was \u201caware of reports of the death of a U.S. citizen in the West Bank,\u201d adding the department had no further comment \u201cout of respect for the privacy of the family and loved ones\u201d of the reported victim.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Friday it was \u201caware of reports regarding a Palestinian civilian killed and a number of injured Palestinians as a result of the confrontation, and they are being looked into by the ISA and Israel Police.",
      "Israel Police and Border Police forces were deployed to the scene \"following reports of a physical confrontation between civilians,\" police told NBC News.",
      "\"Several individuals from both sides were detained at the scene on suspicion of involvement in acts of violence,\" it said. \"A joint investigation has since been opened by the Israel Police and the IDF Military Police.\"",
      "Saif\u2019s cousin Fatmah Muhammed told NBC News on Saturday that Musallet worked in an ice cream shop run by his father in Tampa, Florida. He traveled to the West Bank in June to visit his mother, brother and sister.  Musallet\u2019s father was en route to the West Bank from Florida for his funeral, to be held on Sunday.",
      "\u201cThis news has been devastating for the entire family,\u201d Muhammed said.",
      "Nizar Milbes, a close family friend currently visiting the West Bank from California, told NBC News that many residents of al-Mazra\u2019a ash-Sharqiya are Americans.",
      "The town is known for its olive trees and rolling hills, where many modern Palestinian homes are built, including some of the West Bank\u2019s more opulent houses. Families gathered to barbecue and relax, many of them traveling from the U.S. for vacation, but Milbes said growing settler violence has transformed the area.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left over here for people to enjoy, the settlers have taken everything,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cPeople can\u2019t even go there anymore. The settlers have burned the vacation homes, they\u2019ve encroached and put their stuff there.\u201d",
      "In March, a United Nations report warned that settler violence had \u201cincreased in a climate of continuing impunity.\u201d",
      "Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights group, said settlers rarely face legal consequences for violence perpetrated against Palestinians. Between 2005 and 2023, more than 93% of all investigations were closed without an indictment and only 3% of investigations led to a conviction, according to a report by the organization.",
      "\u201cThe low conviction rate sends the message that the law enforcement system, in its entirety, does not consider settler violence to be a serious issue, contributing to the perpetrators\u2019 sense of immunity,\u201d the report said.",
      "Since October 2023, 961 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, according to a database maintained by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a sharp rise from previous years.",
      "CAIR-Florida, the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a nationwide Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, condemned Israeli settlers, \u201cbacked and enabled by the Israeli government,\u201d for Musallet\u2019s death, and called on President Donald Trump to \u201cput America first.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis murder is only the latest killing of an American citizen by illegal Israeli settlers or soldiers,\u201d the statement said. \u201cEvery other murder of an American citizen has gone unpunished by the American government, which is why the Israeli government keeps wantonly killing American Palestinians and, of course, other Palestinians.\u201d",
      "In April, 14-year-old American Amer Rabee was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers. His family said he was picking almonds, the IDF said he was throwing rocks. In September 2024, Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, was shot dead by an Israeli soldier during a demonstration against West Bank settlements.",
      "American citizens Mohammad Ahmed Mohammad Khdour and Tawfic Hafeth Abdel Jabbar, both 17, were killed by Israeli fire in separate incidents in February and January 2024."
