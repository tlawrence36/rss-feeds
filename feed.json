      "Even as Tom Brady goes through his first postseason and prepares to call his first Super Bowl in three weeks as a television analyst, rumors about his future continue to be rampant, much to the dismay of Fox Sports",
      "Even as Tom Brady goes through his first postseason and prepares to call his first Super Bowl as a television analyst in three weeks, rumors about his future continue to be rampant, much to the dismay of Fox Sports.",
      "Fox Sports president of production and operations/executive producer Brad Zager understands the spotlight Brady and the network are under. Still, Zager said Brady is in it for the long haul.",
      "\u201cThe whole group that said he would never be there then turned into, he\u2019s not going to stay there. It\u2019s just a never-ending, merry-go-round of people trying to come up with the next narrative,\u201d Zager said in a phone interview with The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cTom has done nothing but be engaged with us every time he\u2019s asked about broadcasting. When he was retired and getting in, getting ready, he talked about how excited he was for it, that he was 100% and has never wavered on that. So the fact that there are people on that crew that have to read articles and narratives and predictions that Tom isn\u2019t engaged does wear on you,\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s comments by Zager are the first about Brady by someone from Fox Sports. Brady has not been made available for media interviews this season. He has discussed his first season in the booth during appearances on Colin Cowherd\u2019s show on FS1.",
      "On Thursday, Don Yee, Brady\u2019s agent, told Sports Business Journal that Brady \u201chas had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s really excited about the future with Fox.\u201d Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox in May 2022 while still playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He retired after that season and decided in February 2023 to take a year off before moving into the booth.",
      "\u201cTom has had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s excited about the future with Fox and his growth on their team,\u201d Yee said. \u201cAnd this year was the first year of a long relationship.\u201d",
      "Yee did not return an email or text message by The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Fox Sports has tried to weather the rumors and criticism surrounding Brady\u2019s future and his dual roles as the analyst on its NFL crew and being a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.",
      "Everything has come to a head this week with Brady and Kevin Burkhardt calling Saturday night\u2019s NFC divisional round game in Detroit between the Lions and the Washington Commanders.",
      "Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn are candidates for the Raiders' head coach opening. Brady is involved in the franchise\u2019s coach and general manager selection.",
      "Brady cannot participate in Fox\u2019s production meetings with teams \u2014 either in person or via Zoom \u2014 watch practices, or step foot in a team\u2019s training complex. The only team complex Brady is allowed in is the Raiders.",
      "The league put those parameters in place going into the season after Brady purchased a 5% stake in the Raiders in May 2023. NFL owners approved the purchase last October.",
      "Zager said any inferences about a potential conflict of interest between Brady calling the game and being part of the Raiders\u2019 decision-making process are unfounded.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s questioning his professionalism and integrity. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Zager said.",
      "Any questions Brady would have for the coordinators or head coach Dan Campbell could be asked by Burkhardt or a member of the Fox crew in the production meetings. However, Brady receives the same film and statistical information as everyone else on the crew.",
      "\u201cAnytime you\u2019re around crew members and doing something as a crew, that\u2019s a good thing for the crew. So, we\u2019ve have to overcome that. You\u2019re not going to have that time to bond,\u201d Zager said. \u201cBut when it comes to analyzing the game and learning information, what is available at the fingertips of the average fan now is probably light years ahead of what was available even to the broadcast crew 15-20 years ago. Not being in the meetings has not stopped him from growing as an analyst throughout the season.\u201d",
      "Brady\u2019s analysis of teams and officiating is subject to more scrutiny by the league because of his stake in the Raiders, but it would have to be egregiously critical or call into question the integrity of a team or referee.",
      "Zager pointed out that Brady has been critical of play calls or strategy, just like any analyst is expected to do.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been awesome to watch Tom jump into this, having no broadcast experience, and calling the NFL\u2019s biggest games. He continues to find his rhythm and those spots where he can really shine during a game,\u201d Zager said. \u201cI think he\u2019s hitting a great stride as we head to the postseason in our biggest games. And I\u2019m looking forward to these next three games, which are three biggest games, and what he\u2019s going to add to the broadcast.\u201d",
      "Attention and rumors about Fox\u2019s top NFL crew are nothing new. Troy Aikman and Joe Buck\u2019s future during the 2021 season was constant fodder before both moved to ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d When Brady would join Fox then dominated the 2022 and \u201923 seasons. Brady, though, did take a lot of pressure off the network before Super Bowl 57 in 2023 when he said early in the week leading up to the game that he wouldn\u2019t be joining Fox in 2023, which allowed Greg Olsen to answer questions about the game instead of his future and not be a one-year, lame duck analyst on a top network team."

      "ROME -- Pompeii, the ancient Roman city buried by ash and lava in 70 AD, has unearthed a new treasure -- a private bathhouse built 2,000 years ago, decorated with sumptuous mosaics and equipped with a series of hot, warm and cold rooms in the manner of a spa.",
      "\u201cWe have here perhaps the largest thermal complex in a private house in Pompeii,\u201d said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii archaeological park. \u201cThe members of the ruling class of Pompeii set up enormous spaces in their homes to host banquets.",
      "\u201cThey had the function of creating consensus, promoting an election campaign, closing deals. It was an opportunity to show the wealth in which they lived and also to have a nice thermal treatment,\" he explained.",
      "The baths were unearthed in the so -called Regio IX, a large central area of Pompeii park still unexplored, where major archaeological excavations are revealing new aspects of Pompeians' daily life.",
      "Recently, archeologists working in the same area found a bakery, a laundry shop, two villas and the bones of three people who died during the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which destroyed both the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.",
      "Zuchtriegel said wealthy habitants of Pompeii often used first to take a bath and then to have a banquet, so the private spa complex allowed to do that altogether inside the same house.",
      "\u201cThere is room for about 30 people who could do the whole routine, and that could also be done in public baths. So there is the calidarium, a very warm environment and also a large tub with cold water,\u201d he said.",

      "The suit filed in federal court in New York by Baldoni and production company Wayfarer Studios seeks at least $400 million for damages that include lost future income. It alleges that Lively and Reynolds hijacked the production and marketing of \u201cIt Ends With Us\" and manipulated media to smear Baldoni and others on the production with false allegations of sexual and other harassment.",
      "\u201cThis is a case about two of the most powerful stars in the world deploying their enormous power to steal an entire film right out of the hands of its director and production studio,\u201d the suit says. \u201cThen, when Lively and Reynolds\u2019 efforts failed to win them the acclaim they believed they so richly deserved, they turned their fury on their chosen scapegoat.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit comes about two weeks after Lively sued Baldoni and several others tied to the film, alleging they retaliated against her for coming forward about her treatment on the set. That lawsuit came just hours after Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel, alleging the paper worked with Lively to smear him.",
      "An email sent to publicist Leslie Sloane \u2014 who is also named as a defendant \u2014 seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "The Times said it stood by its reporting and planned to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the allegations.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d based on the bestselling 2016 novel by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and exceeded box office expectations with a $50 million debut. It begins as a standard romantic drama before taking a dark turn into domestic violence.",
      "The film's release was shrouded by speculation over discord between co-stars Lively and Baldoni, and the fallout has made make major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "\u201cHeartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Allegations from Lively that she was shown pornography and subjected to unwanted discussions about it from Baldoni and a producer were utterly false, the suit alleges.",
      "\u201cLively was so close and comfortable with Baldoni that she freely breast-fed in front of him during meetings,\u201d the suit says.",
      "She would later take moments like these that she encouraged and recast them as sexual harassment and misconduct from Baldoni, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It also says that counter to Lively's allegations, every request she made for an intimacy coordinator to help with sensitive scenes on the film was honored. It focuses especially on a a birthing scene, saying Lively's contention that she was \u201cmostly nude\u201d with non-essential people present including the film's financier were \"knowingly false.\"",
      "\u201cLively was wearing black briefs and a pregnancy suit that covered her midsection, and her top was covered by a hospital gown,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Baldoni says that at another point during the production, because he has back problems, he privately and politely asked Lively her weight so that he could work with his personal trainer to be able to safely lift her in the film.",
      "Reynolds later \u201cswore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife,\" the suit says.",
      "\u201cIn fact, Lively had earlier expressed insecurity about her postpartum figure, and Baldoni made every attempt to genuinely reassure her,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took center stage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Baldoni says the \u201ctone-deaf\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d moves from Lively that led to her attempt at a counter-narrative included naming a drink at the post-premiere party \u201cRyle You Wait,\u201d after the character who engages in domestic violence.",
      "The backlash against Baldoni led to his being dropped by his agency WME, which also represents both Lively and Reynolds,",
      "The suit alleges Reynolds was responsible for this, saying that he approached a WME executive at the \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d premiere and \u201cexpressed his deep disdain for Baldoni, suggesting the agency was working with a \u2018sexual predator.\u2019\u201d",
      "Prior to \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart,\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.",
      "\u201cLively knew full well that making those allegations would be a career death sentence for Plaintiffs, especially given that Baldoni has lived his private and public life as an impassioned advocate for gender equality and healthy masculinity,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's lawsuit says Lively's cruelty even extended to having her suit served on Baldoni and his co-defendants during the onset of the wildfires that have ravaged the Los Angeles area, saying that on a day when they were \"gathering their kids and pets, preparing 'go bags' and monitoring evacuation orders while fearing for their homes, Lively\u2014from the safety of her penthouse in New York\u2014 deployed process servers.\u201d",
      "The suit against Baldoni and other defendants was filed on Dec. 31, but the serving of papers as required by law came the following week."

      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is show this moment where media forever changed,\u201d says John Magaro, who stars as producer Geoffrey Mason. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t know what they were unlocking, what they were letting out of a Pandora\u2019s Box. They were just trying to tell the story. But in doing that, they opened up a road to more sensationalism in journalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, has been hailed as an expertly crafted pressure cooker of journalism ethics. While the Munich Olympics terrorist attack has been the subject of several previous films, including Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cMunich\u201d (2005) and the 1999 documentary \u201cOne Day in September,\u201d \u201cSeptember 5\u201d \u2013 a kind of combination of \u201cSpotlight\u201d and \u201cRear Window\u201d \u2013 keeps its focus entirely on the broadcast that culminated in Jim McKay\u2019s much-remembered announcement of the hostages' tragic end: \u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a group of experienced or trained news journalists reporting on this crisis,\u201d says Swiss director Tim Fehlbaum, who wrote the screenplay with Moritz Binder. \u201cIt was a bunch of sports TV people. That offered an interesting opportunity to confront them with these questions, in an almost innocent way.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d what was on TV screens in 1972, like McKay\u2019s report, is likewise what's seen in the movie. Real archival footage is a co-star. But everyone inside the studio is played by a sterling ensemble, including Peter Sarsgaard (a veteran of another striking journalism movie, 2003\u2019s \u201cShattered Glass\u201d ) as \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d creator Roone Arledge and Ben Chaplin as producer Marvin Bader.",
      "But if there\u2019s a central figure in \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d it\u2019s Mason, a then-young ABC Sports producer thrown into covering one of the biggest news stories of the decade. It was likewise a leading-man chance for Magaro, the talented 41-year-old Ohio native whose sensitive performances in films like \u201cFirst Cow\u201d and \u201cPast Lives\u201d have made him a standout character actor.",
      "\u201cIn a lot of ways, that\u2019s what was the most intriguing part of the script for me,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can be an actor without feeling this competitive nature and need to seize opportunities when they\u2019re presented because there\u2019s not a lot them. I think it was the same for Geoff Mason at the time.\u201d",
      "Magaro\u2019s first time on a movie set was as an extra in \u201cMunich.\u201d Since then, though, he\u2019s grown as an actor through an ethic of hard work that he traces back to his family\u2019s immigrant, working-class roots.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m a 5-7 nebbishy white kid from Cleveland, Ohio,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cThis kind of journey doesn\u2019t happen to many of us. It\u2019s been a hard road at times and it\u2019s been a continuous climb. I never expected to get this far but I always had a drive in me to get better as an actor.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d Fehlbaum put a premium on authenticity. From museums and collectors he gathered the then-cutting edge video technology of the early 1970s and brought it up to working order. Walking onto the set, which with near-accuracy recreated the ABC control room, was \u201clike stepping onto a submarine everyday,\u201d says Magaro. (The U-boat-set 1981 film \u201cDas Boot\u201d was, appropriately, as inspiration for Fehlbaum.)",
      "The actors leaned into the same ethos. Magaro depended considerably on the anecdotes and advice of Mason who went on to have a decorated, decades-long career in television. With his help, Magaro sat in on CBS\u2019s Sunday NFL control room and games at Madison Square Garden to soak up the fast-paced atmosphere.",
      "\u201cGeoff told me that day there was no chance to think. Their singular goal was to stay on the air to keep the story going, to do their job as sports broadcasters,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cOnce the clock starts ticking, there\u2019s no chance to think.\u201d",
      "In chronicling the minute-by-minute drama of covering the Munich terrorist attack, \u201cSeptember 5\u201d sidesteps the political repercussions of one the most infamous chapters of Israeli-Palestinian relations. The film was in post-production when Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023. It first debuted at film festivals last fall while the Israeli war in Gaza continued.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, raising hopes that the 15-month conflict could be nearing an end. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said the agreement was still not complete.",
      "Yet \u201cSeptember 5\" strives to keep its focus on media, not politics.",
      "\u201cHas anything ever really changed? That conflict has been going on since 1948 when Israel was created,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cIt\u2019s a question, no matter what side you\u2019re on, you can ask yourself, even with the current situation: Is the media covering this the best way possible?\u201d",
      "Earlier foundational moments in the history of live news broadcasting stretch back to April 1949, when 3-year-old Kathy Fiscus fell down an abandoned well in San Marino, California. KTLA in Los Angeles televised more than 27 hours of the rescue effort live.",
      "Today's media landscape, populated by social media and digital platforms that are often riddled with misinformation in some ways makes the ethical questions wrestled over in \u201cSeptember 5\u201d seem almost quaint. But for Fehlbaum, it's less about what's changed than what hasn't.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve observed is that while technology changes a lot, the bigger ethical or moral questions are still the same,\u201d Fehlbaum says. \"For both those reporting on a crisis and us consuming news.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- Comedian and host Conan O'Brien was named the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy on Thursday.",
      "O'Brien, 61, has carved out an improbable decadeslong career arc, moving from goofy television interloper to comedic elder statesman. Along the way, he survived one of the most public failures in the history of television on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 only to launch a successful, and sustained, next act.",
      "His travel series \u201cConan O'Brien Must Go\u201d sparked popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. In March, O'Brien will host the Academy Awards three weeks before his own Mark Twain ceremony in Washington.",
      "Deborah Rutter, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in a statement called O'Brien \u201ca master of invention and reinvention, consistently pushing the envelope in search of new comedic heights.\"",
      "O\u2019Brien offered his own tongue-in-cheek assessment, saying in the Kennedy Center statement that he would be \u201cthe first winner of the Mark Twain Prize recognized not for humor, but for my work as a riverboat pilot.\u201d He will be honored on March 23 in a special ceremony in which he will receive a bronze bust of Twain, the iconic American writer and satirist whose real name was Samuel Clemens.",
      "Mark Twain recipients are honored with a night of testimonials and video tributes, often featuring previous award winners. The ceremony will stream on Netflix at a later date yet to be announced.",
      "O'Brien leaped into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993, when he was chosen to replace the legendary David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "Bringing a skittish, awkward energy that contrasted with Letterman's deadpan persona, O'Brien constantly made fun of his own gangly appearance and inappropriateness for the job. He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host.",
      "In 2009, O'Brien's career and persona took a turn. He became the man who publicly gained and lost his dream job while America watched.",
      "O'Brien was tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d despite public warnings from his own guests that Leno wasn't ready to cede the throne. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "The aftermath split the comedy world, with Leno cast as the villain and O'Brien as the victim who was set up to fail.",
      "In an emotional goodbye on his final \u201cTonight Show,\u201d O'Brien described himself as lucky and refused to sound bitter.",
      "\u201cEvery comedian dreams of hosting 'The Tonight Show,' and for seven months I got to do it,\" he said. \"I did it my way with people I love, and I don't regret one second.\u201d",
      "He ended with a sort of generational rallying cry.",
      "\u201cAll I ask is this one thing, particularly of young people that watch: Please do not be cynical,\u201d O'Brien said, his voice cracking. \u201cNobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get, but if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.\u201d",
      "O'Brien reemerged later in 2010 with a new talk show on the cable station TBS. Despite the channel's lower profile, the show ran for 11 years while he launched parallel ventures like the podcast \u201cConan O'Brien Needs a Friend\u201d and the travel show \u201cConan Without Borders,\u201d a precursor to his current show.",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Dave Chappelle. Bill Cosby, the 2009 recipient, had his Mark Twain Prize rescinded in 2019 amid multiple allegations of sexual assault."

      "He drops the audience into the warm everyday of the beautiful home of Eunice (Fernanda Torres) and Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), in 1970s Rio de Janeiro, where their five kids run freely between the beach and their living room. Life is calmly chaotic, full of affection, gentle familial teasing and various life stages (one is about to lose a tooth, another about to go to university). Someone always seems to have wet hair, be covered in sand, or bringing in a mangy stray, as their youngest, Marcelo, does in the film\u2019s lovely opening. Even if their life is technically worlds away from any one person in the audience, it feels familiar and close.",
      "Anyone coming to \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d will surely know that this domestic tranquility does not and cannot hold. It was about seven years into Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which would last until 1985. And while the film suggests that there was a semblance of normalcy in their day to day, there are also ominous signs of change and oppression \u2014 reports of ambassadors being kidnapped on the news, and tense \u201crandom\u201d traffic stops that their eldest daughter endures one night. Some left-leaning citizens are making plans to leave, but the Paiva family is not in a terrible rush. They\u2019re even making plans to build a new home.",
      "So when three men in civilian clothes enter their home one afternoon and tell Rubens, a former left-leaning congressman, that he needs to come in for questioning, it happens with little incident. Everyone is on guard \u2014 they\u2019re not naive \u2014 but you sense that Eunice believes he will come back that night. Maybe even the next day. Rubens is calm changing into a collared shirt and tie and lying to his daughter that he is going into the office, even though it\u2019s a holiday. But he also savors this moment with her, perhaps because he knows he\u2019s likely to not return.",
      "The film is based on a memoir written by Paiva\u2019s son, Marcelo, but you don\u2019t need to know that to know that it is first and foremost a memory piece. It is deeply personal and imbued with the kind of tenderness that is extremely difficult to see or appreciate in the moment. And although it\u2019s certainly idealized and wistful, we accept any assumed white lies because we all wish that for ourselves: to truly recognize what we have before it\u2019s gone.",
      "This story is not about the abduction, however, or what may have happened to Rubens after that day. It\u2019s about how Eunice continues on, through uncertainty, absence and, ultimately, the loss of hope. Salles chooses to tell this story in a rather straightforward manner, which works well, allowing the compelling narrative and the talented actors to carry the audience through.",
      "At the heart of it is Torres, who has already won a Golden Globe for her performance and whose portrayal of Eunice is a true marvel. Mothers and wives often get the short shrift in movies like this, about Big Important Topics decided on by men, but Torres instills Eunice with a deep emotional and practical intelligence that\u2019s beautifully feminine, whether she\u2019s dealing with a misogynist banker, a dead dog in the street or the thugs surveilling her home. She\u2019s fascinating and resilient in a way that so many women are in times of historical strife but rarely celebrated for.",
      "In one particularly poignant scene, she and the kids are being photographed by a journalist hoping to tell their story. They smile together, as they did earlier in the film when Rubens was there. Now he\u2019s not, and the reporters are confused. They ask Eunice to try a more serious expression. She laughs, \u201cThey want us to look sad,\u201d and instructs her kids to keep smiling. It\u2019s a perfect encapsulation of the complex spirit of the movie. Political disappearances don\u2019t begin and end with the victim, or the toppling of a regime \u2014 they are generational traumas that live on in the survivors and alter everything in their wake.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in limited release Friday (expanding on Jan. 24), is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csmoking, drug use, brief nudity, some strong language, thematic content.\u201d Running time: 135 minutes. Three stars out of four."

    "story": [
      "Horror, not comedy, has been the go-to movie genre in recent years, but a movie like \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d starring Keke Palmer and, in her big-screen debut, SZA, is a good reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing",
      "Horror, not comedy, has been the go-to movie genre in recent years, but a movie like \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d starring Keke Palmer and, in her big-screen debut, SZA, is a good reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing.",
      "Creepy stuff and jump scares, we\u2019ve been told, have proved better suited for channeling our abiding contemporary dread. But the communal joys of big-screen comedy have, and always will, suit dark days as much as light ones, if not more so. \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d for instance, happens to arrive while Los Angeles, where the movie is set, has been decimated by wildfires. The Southern California skies, though, are crystal clear in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d In the opening moments, someone says, \u201cIt\u2019s always cooler on the West side.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d which had its premiere cancelled by the fires, is a welcome warm breeze for a movie landscape that has largely frozen out the comedy. There\u2019s one overwhelming reason for this: Keke Palmer.",
      "This is a buddy comedy, so it might seem unfair to single out one half of a duo. SZA, in her first feature, acquits herself well. But this is Palmer\u2019s show.",
      "Palmer plays Dreux, a Los Angeles waitress who, when her artist roommate Alyssa (SZA) gives their rent money to an untrustworthy boyfriend, Keshawn (Joshua David Neal), goes on a madcap, day-long odyssey to raise the money before they\u2019re evicted. This seemingly low-stakes premise is itself a kind of throwback to a more 1990s-flavored movie. The antic spirit of F. Gary Gray\u2019s \u201cFriday\u201d can be felt throughout \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d",
      "The tone here, courtesy of director Lawrence Lamont, producer Issa Rae and screenwriter Syreeta Singleton, is amiably realistic. Aside from a few cartoonish flourishes, \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is grounded in a working-class reality where every step toward upward mobility for Dreux and Alyssa is swiftly knocked backward.",
      "They live in a dilapidated apartment complex in the neighborhood of Baldwin Village, nicknamed the Jungles. When they\u2019re forced to raise $1,500 \u2014 a race complete with a ticking-clock countdown to eviction, and, as things develop, until \u201ccertain death\u201d \u2014 Dreux is also scheduled for the biggest job interview of her life, to become a franchise manager for the restaurant chain she\u2019s employed by.",
      "The satire of \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is mostly directed at the feeble opportunities afforded to those striving to break out of a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. When the roommates seek a loan, their payday center advertises a comical APR of 1,900.5%. (The agent, who takes great pleasure in their credit scores, is memorably played by Keyla Monterroso Mejia.)",
      "That\u2019s just one of the characters the two encounter in their pleasantly meandering journey to raise money via everything from blood donation to Air Jordans hung on power lines. Some of the characters along the way include Katt Williams, as a conscientious homeless man who warns against predatory lending; Vanessa Bell Calloway\u2019s stripper-turned-blood-bank-worker; a new white neighbor named Bethany (Maude Apatow); and Keshawn\u2019s new hook-up (Janelle James), who proves the movie\u2019s most regular villain, despite the looming presence of a fearsome gangster (Amin Joseph).",
      "Anyone familiar with Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d will recognize some of the hallmarks of that HBO series, namely the struggles of Black women trying to get a leg up in Los Angeles while also juggling romantic interests that might come from a wide range of backgrounds. Here, that\u2019s Dreux\u2019s crush, Maniac (Patrick Cage), who drives a Mercedes and who she suspects is a criminal.",
      "If all of this sounds somewhat low stakes (I failed to mention Lil Rel Howery as their prospective sneaker buyer), that\u2019s more of a pleasing feature than a bug in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d Besides, filling this movie with anything more \u2014 star cameos or broad comedy set pieces \u2014 would be a mistake. That would leave less room for the interplay between Palmer and SZA.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days\u201d hinges on central buddy comedy, which Lamont seems to recognize even in his feature directorial debut. SZA\u2019s uber-cool unsurprisingly transfers easily to the big screen; her performance is winning because it\u2019s so unforced.",
      "But it\u2019s a testament to Palmer\u2019s dynamism as a performer that \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d would work no matter where their day takes them. There\u2019s a freewheeling wit and ever-shifting subtlety to Palmer, who so enlivened Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cNope.\u201d Only a theatrical comedy can really showcase charisma like hers. For an actress who\u2019s hustled to get to this point, \u201cOne of Them\u201d days is perfect platform for Palmer, scrappy and unstoppable.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, sexual material and brief drug use. Running time: 97 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "A hip-hop superstar beef was cranked up another notch Wednesday when Drake sued Universal Music Group for defamation over rival Kendrick Lamar's diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges UMG \u2014 the parent record label for Drake and Lamar \u2014 published and promoted the track even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice. Lamar is not named in the suit.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard and two attempted break-ins at Drake\u2019s Toronto home, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand's value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year.",
      "\u201cThe lawsuit is not about the artist who created \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\" the lawsuit says, referring to Lamar. \u201cIt is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d",
      "The suit later alleges, \u201cUMG did so because it understood that the Recording's inflammatory and shocking allegations were a gold mine.\u201d",
      "And, the suit claims, the music company has made large investments and used its connections to arrange for \u201cNot Like Us\u201d to be performed at next month's Super Bowl, where Lamar will be the halftime entertainment.",
      "The lawsuit, which is seeking a trial and an undisclosed amount of money for damages, also repeated allegations in other legal filings that UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on streaming services.",
      "The track is nominated for five Grammys, including record of the year and song of the year.",
      "UMG disputed the lawsuit's allegations in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cNot only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist \u2014 let alone Drake \u2014 is illogical,\" the company said. \u201cWe have invested massively in his music and our employees around the world have worked tirelessly for many years to help him achieve historic commercial and personal financial success.\u201d",
      "The company added: \u201cThroughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth \u2018rap battles\u2019 to express his feelings about other artists. He now seeks to weaponize the legal process to silence an artist\u2019s creative expression and to seek damages from UMG for distributing that artist\u2019s music. \u201d",
      "Representatives for Lamar did not respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner whose full name is Aubrey Drake Graham, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre\u2019s biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year.",
      "Drake's lawyers, from New York-based Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said the lawsuit seeks to hold UMG accountable for knowingly promoting false and defamatory allegations against him. They said the shooting and break-in attempts at Drake's home, and the online vitriol, prompted him to move his family out of the house, and that he fears for his and their safety.",
      "\u201cBeginning on May 4, 2024 and every day since, UMG has used its massive resources as the world\u2019s most powerful music company to elevate a dangerous and inflammatory message that was designed to assassinate Drake\u2019s character, and led to actual violence at Drake\u2019s doorstep,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit reveals the human and business consequences to UMG\u2019s elevation of profits over the safety and well-being of its artists, and shines a light on the manipulation of artists and the public for corporate gain,\u201d it said."

      "It will not, of course, because this is a Blumhouse movie called \u201cWolf Man.\u201d It will not be good for Blake and it will not be good for the audience. That's because this film is a terrible misfire using a classic movie monster poorly rebooted by the modern home of horror.",

When it does, the filmmakers lean on creepy sounds way too much.",
      "There's a Wolf Man out there and he's, well, underwhelming. He is largely unseen for most of the movie because seeing the monster is always a bad idea. At one, point, he attacks through the cabin's doggie door, one of the most disappointing assaults on film.",
      "Now infected inside their barricaded cabin, Blake goes through a body-horror transformation, which includes the sweats, enhanced hearing, uncontrolled peeing, teeth readjustment, mottled skin, being made mute and hair loss. That's right, hair loss. This is the first Wolf Man movie that seems to endorse Rogaine.",
      "His wife, played by Julia Garner, is left here to sniffle and shriek, going from life partner to potential dinner. That means a lot of running and panting with a flashlight in hand. Their daughter, played by Matilda Firth, earlier so precocious, now asks really stupid questions like \u201cWhat's happening?\u201d and \u201cWhat's wrong with Daddy?\u201d",
      "So, outside the cabin lurks a Wolf Man. And inside is potentially another, but one still kind of trying to hold onto his humanity. \u201cMom, he wants this to be over,\u201d the girl says of her dad-wolf. We know the feeling.",
      "\u201cWolf Man,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cbloody violent content, grisly images and some language.\u201d Running time: 103 minutes. No stars out of four."

      "\u201cThe ceremony is a month away. It would be inappropriate and far too early to say anything about that,\u201d Putt told The Associated Press.",
      "The five films nominated for the best film award were \u201c Conclave,\u201d \u201c Emilia Perez,\u201d the 215-minute postwar epic \u201d The Brutalist,\u201d the Palme d\u2019Or-winning comedy/drama \u201c Anora \u2033 and the Bob Dylan biopic \u201c A Complete Unknown.\u201d",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Best-selling British author Neil Gaiman released a statement Wednesday denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex after a magazine this week published allegations from several women, accusing him of sexual assault.",
      "The 64-year-old author of \u201cThe Sandman\u201d comic book series and novel \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d was responding to a New York Magazine article that detailed allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women. The allegations of four of them had been broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "Gaiman said he had watched stories about him circulate on the Internet for months with \u201chorror and dismay.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don\u2019t, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen. I\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\u201d Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Gaiman said he had read back message exchanges he had had with his accusers. They still read like \u201ctwo people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships and wanting to see one another again,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd I also realise, looking through them, years later, that I could have and should have done so much better. I was emotionally unavailable while being sexually available, self-focused and not as thoughtful as I could or should have been. I was obviously careless with people\u2019s hearts and feelings, and that\u2019s something that I really, deeply regret,\u201d Gaiman said.",
      "Most of the allegations relate to occasions when Gaiman was in his 40s or older and living in the United States, Britain and New Zealand.",
      "One of the accusers, Scarlett Pavlovich, told New York Magazine she met Gaiman through his then-wife, U.S. performer Amanda Palmer, on a New Zealand island where the couple lived with their son in 2022. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman abused her several times starting the night they met.",
      "Some of Pavlovich\u2019s allegations were first made public six months earlier in the podcast.",
      "She told the magazine she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault.",
      "New Zealand Police this week would not say whether Gaiman was, or had been, under investigation.",
      "\u201cIn general, Police cannot respond to queries which seek to establish whether specific individuals are, or have been, under Police investigation. Additionally, anyone who makes a complaint to Police has the right to privacy,\u201d New Zealand Police told The Associated Press in an email on Tuesday.",
      "The AP\u2019s messages to Gaiman\u2019s agent, his office and to Bloomsbury, publisher of several of his recent books, were not returned.",
      "Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which both have Gaiman-related projects scheduled for this year, haven't responded to the AP\u2019s messages.",
      "Several of Gaiman's works have been turned into movies and television programs."

      "When the Palisades Fire broke out in Los Angeles last Tuesday, Hollywood\u2019s awards season was in full swing. The Golden Globes had transpired less than 48 hours earlier and a series of splashy awards banquets followed in the days after.",
      "But the enormity of the destruction in Southern California has quickly snuffed out all festiveness in the movie industry\u2019s high season of celebration. At one point, the flames even encroached on the hillside above the Dolby Theatre, the home of the Academy Awards.",
      "The fires have struck at the very heart of a movie industry still trying to stabilize itself after years of pandemic, labor turmoil and technological upheaval. Not for the first time this decade, the Oscars are facing the question of: Should the show go on? And if it does, what do they mean now?",
      "\u201cWith ALL due respect during Hollywood\u2019s season of celebration, I hope any of the networks televising the upcoming awards will seriously consider NOT televising them and donating the revenue they would have gathered to victims of the fires and the firefighters,\u201d \u201cHacks\u201d star Jean Smart, a recent Globe winner, wrote on Instagram.",
      "The Oscars remain as scheduled, but it\u2019s certain that they will be transformed due to the wildfires, and that most of the red-carpet pomp that typically stretches between now and then will be curtailed if not altogether canceled. With so many left without a home by the fires, there\u2019s scant appetite for the usual self-congratulatory parades of the season.",
      "Focus has turned, instead, to what the Oscars might symbolize for a traumatized Los Angeles. The Oscars have never meant less, but, at the same time, they might be more important than ever as a beacon of perseverance for the reeling movie capital.",
      "The film academy on Monday for the second time delayed its nominations announcement. Nominations will now be announced virtually on Feb. 23. The academy also canceled its annual nominees luncheon and said it\u2019s planning to honor frontline workers and to support relief efforts.",
      "\u201cWe will get through this together and bring a sense of healing to our global film community,\u201d vowed Bill Kramer, academy chief executive, and Janet Yang, academy president.",
      "The fires, one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history, continue. The ongoing nature of the crisis, which has killed at least 25 people, has made remaking well-laid plans a moving target. The Critics Choice Awards have been postponed. Nominations to the Producers Guild Awards have been delayed twice with no new date set. On Tuesday, the guild established a fund to support producers affected by the fires.",
      "The 67th Grammy Awards, scheduled to be held Feb. 2 in downtown Los Angeles, are going forward, albeit with significant changes. Harvey Mason jr., Recording Academy chief executive and Board of Trustees chair Tammy Hurt said this year's Grammys \u201cwill carry a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.\u201d",
      "Some telethon-like element also seems sure to accompany the Oscars. In recent days, many throughout the industry have voiced suggestions for how the broadcast could be reconsidered. A not dissimilar process happened during the 2021 Oscars, which were postponed to late April because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Oscars have been moved a few times throughout history, including in 1938, when the show was delayed a week due to historic flooding in Los Angeles.",
      "For the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the wildfires have been acutely personal. Four of the academy\u2019s 55-person board of governors lost their homes, according to The Hollywood Reporter, including producer Lynette Howell Taylor, visual effects governor Brooke Breton, sound branch governor Mark P. Stoeckinger and animation branch governor Jinko Gotoh. The Pacific Palisades, which was largely destroyed by the fires, was home to many stars and executives.",
      "For potential nominees, this would normally be when they\u2019d be at their most active, campaigning in Q&As and other events tied to the all-important nominations voting period. All of that has ground to a halt. Isabella Rossellini, who\u2019s favored to be nominated for best supporting actress for her performance in \u201cConclave,\u201d on Instagram posted a photograph of an Oscar lying in ashes. The photo turned out to be fake, but it accurately captured Hollywood\u2019s current mood.",
      "Several high-profile TV series were forced to pause production because of the fires but notably few movie shoots were affected. That, in itself, is a reflection of a Hollywood that has seen the majority of film production seek tax incentives in other states.",
      "Work throughout the film and TV industry hasn\u2019t rebounded following the 2023 strikes, leaving large numbers of crew members unemployed. So quiet are studio lots that actress Natalie Morales (\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d) has advocated for studios, in the wake of the fires, to turn empty soundstages into temporary classrooms, erected by out-of-work craftspeople, for children whose schools burned down.",
      "It\u2019s a reminder that many in the film business need all the work they can find, including all the jobs that accompany the Oscars. Not only are the Academy Awards a vital spotlight on a wide swath of movies that otherwise might struggle to find audiences, the awards provide a lot of jobs to an awards season industrial complex of workers, stylists and vendors.",
      "With so many out of work before the fires hit, Silvina Knight, an Emmy-winning makeup artist, calls this latest crisis \u201canother setback \u2013 a big one.\u201d She is currently working on \u201cSuits LA,\u201d one of the series that stopped filming due to the fires.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how people are going to feel about getting dressed up and when they just lost everything,\u201d said Knight of the Oscars. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know, it might be a show of force when we come back. Yeah, this is tragic, but we are all coming together. Even driving home the other night, motorists were being very considerate of each other, which is unusual for Los Angeles.\u201d",

      "DEERFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions in the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids, according to a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",
      "Walgreens, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 locations, said in a statement that it stands behind its pharmacists. It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

      "Some wounds suffered by six Hawaii residents flown to Arizona for medical treatment after a deadly illegal fireworks explosion on New Year\u2019s are comparable to battlefield injuries",
      "HONOLULU -- Some wounds suffered by six Hawaii residents flown to Arizona for medical treatment after a deadly illegal fireworks explosion on New Year's are comparable to battlefield injuries, the doctor overseeing their care said Friday.",
      "Dr. Kevin Foster, the director of the Arizona Burn Center in Phoenix, said flying particles and debris from the explosion inflicted traumatic injuries.",
      "\u201cIn addition to the thermal injury that comes from the heat and the flame and the fire, we also have an explosive nature to this with particles moving at very high speeds striking patients,\u201d Foster said at a news conference from Phoenix that was streamed online.",
      "The blast killed four people, including a 3-year-old boy, and injured about 20 others. The U.S. military flew six of the wounded to Arizona on Jan. 4 because Hawaii\u2019s lone burn unit didn't have enough capacity to care for all the victims.",
      "Medical staff hadn't realized the magnitude of the injuries from the flying particles until the patients had surgery. But Foster said this was to be expected.",
      "\u201cYou really have to get into the operating room and start operating on these people to really understand that. So it\u2019s not surprising that nobody picked up on this,\u201d Foster said.",
      "The traumatic injuries resulted in some unusual infections but Foster said this didn\u2019t catch caregivers off guard. Doctors at the center have seen these types of injuries in fireworks patients before and infections in burn patients are almost unavoidable, he said.",
      "The blast happened at a three-story home with a bottom-level carport in a Honolulu residential neighborhood.",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green earlier this week proposed a range of new penalties to crack down on those who flout the state\u2019s fireworks laws. The state Department of Law Enforcement has asked the Legislature for $5.2 million to hire eight people and expand a forensic lab to counter rampant smuggling of illegal fireworks."

      "The U.S. Justice Department says Alabama is unnecessarily institutionalizing children with physical disabilities in nursing homes and hospitals",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama children with physical disabilities are being unnecessarily institutionalized in nursing homes, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday, warning it would file suit against the state unless changes are made to allow more of these children to live at home.",
      "A Justice Department investigation found Alabama is violating the requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act to administer services to individuals with disabilities in the setting most appropriate to the person\u2019s needs.",
      "\u201cMany children with physical disabilities in Alabama are unnecessarily institutionalized or are at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke wrote to state officials.",
      "Clarke announced the probe's findings in a letter to the Alabama Department of Human Resources, the Alabama Medicaid Agency and the Alabama Department of Senior Services. It listed changes the state should make to provide more community services and threatened a federal lawsuit if action isn't taken.",
      "Alabama\u2019s Gov. Kay Ivey\u2019s office referred questions to the state agencies. The Department of Human Resources did not immediately respond to an email Thursday seeking comment.",
      "The federal investigation found that Alabama policies effectively limit community-based services, or long-term support services, which allow children with physical disabilities to live at home.",
      "Federal officials said the state has not adequately developed its community-based workforce. The Justice Department also said Alabama fails to support foster parents who care for, or are considering caring for, children with physical disabilities.",
      "Alabama parents too often face a difficult choice of sending their children to nursing homes for life or quitting their jobs to become full-time caregivers, the Justice Department wrote.",
      "\u201cSome children who could otherwise be cared for in family homes have spent their formative years growing up in nursing homes, separated from their families and communities. Others live on the brink of such institutionalization, as their families struggle physically, financially, and emotionally to keep them at home,\u201d Clarke wrote.",
      "P.J. Alexander said he and his wife were one of those Alabama families. Their son Kyle was born with a complex set of medical issues, including genetic conditions and cerebral palsy.",
      "\u201cWe were able to keep him at home, just barely,\u201d he said.",
      "They had considered moving to another state that provides more resources for families caring for profoundly disabled children. Kyle passed away suddenly Nov. 25 at age 10 from cardiac failure, Alexander said.",
      "\u201cHe was such a happy boy, he\u2019d always smile. For someone who had so many struggles,\" Alexander said."

      "The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather. Another polar vortex disruption will stretch Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump's second inauguration the coldest in 40 years, meteorologists said.",
      "After starting in the Rockies Thursday night, the cold will blast eastward and as far south as the upper Florida peninsula over several days. Up to 280 million Americans will have a day or two where it\u2019s colder than Anchorage, Alaska, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.",
      "\u201cThis would be one of the coldest outbreaks certainly of the past 10 years, 15 years,\u201d said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric Environmental Research. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling air out of Siberia. And, you know, that\u2019s consistent with these stretches because when the polar vortex stretches, the flow starts in Siberia and ends in the United States.\u201d",
      "It will arrive in Washington well before Trump's inauguration Monday outside the U.S. Capitol. The National Weather Service is predicting the temperature to be around 22 degrees (minus-6 Celsius) at noon during the swearing-in, the coldest since Ronald Reagan's second inauguration saw temperatures plunge to 7 degrees (minus-14 Celsius). Barack Obama 2009 swearing-in was 28 degrees (minus-2 Celsius).",
      "But that's not all because the wind is forecast to be 30 to 35 mph (48 to 56 kph).",
      "\u201cThe wind chills would be in the single digits for sure,\u201d the NWS' Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be cold, blustery, basically right up the National Mall. And it can get pretty breezy on the mall there with the west-northwest wind right in the face.\u201d",
      "Washington could see single digits later and on Wednesday morning might get near zero, Maue said. There could be a record low broken in Baltimore, Taylor said. He said most of the records that will be broken in this cold outbreak are not likely to be overnight lows, but still chilly daytime highs.",
      "About 80 million people are likely to have subzero temperatures at some point, Maue said.",
      "\"The coldest will be Tuesday morning for the Lower 48 overall,\" Maue said. The average low that morning for the entire Lower 48 will be around 7 degrees (minus-14 degrees Celsius), he said.",
      "Maue said a stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio, to Pittsburgh will get the most brutal cold compared to their normal temperatures.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like a corridor of extreme cold, calm winds at night over snow cover. Temperatures could really drop like a rock there,\u201d Maue said.",
      "Freezes could go as far as the Gulf Coast and northern Florida, meteorologists said.",
      "Earlier this month, long-range forecasts hinted at worst-in-30-years type of cold for the year's first week, but those predictions eased as the cold outbreak got closer. It was cold, but not near record levels. This time, it\u2019s the opposite. Each day\u2019s computer models show it colder than the previous one, Maue said.",
      "There's some possibility of snow squalls here and there, but it's mostly just going to be cold, Taylor said \u2014 what Maue called a dry cold.",
      "As happened earlier this month, this cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. That ring is being stretched south across North America like a rubber band, Cohen said.",
      "These stretching events are happening more often in the past decade or so, Cohen said. He and others have linked these polar vortex outbreaks to human-caused climate change and decreasing pressure and temperature differences between the Arctic and the rest of the globe.",
      "Those also trigger changes in the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that usually brings weather from west to east \u2014 that make cold air and weather systems plunge from north to south like a roller coaster.",
      "On the east side of that plunge is cold air and potentially record high pressure, Taylor and others said.",
      "On the west side, in southern California, is not only warmer air but also the extreme pressure differences that could goose the already high winds that are fanning fires around Los Angeles, meteorologists said.",
      "Get used to it. There's some debate among meteorologists about how long this extreme cold outbreak will last but below normal temperatures may stick around through the end of the month for much of the country, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who organized winter weather workshops at the American Meteorological Society's annual conference in New Orleans.",
      "And Cohen said long-range forecasts suggest the same polar vortex conditions could return in early February.",

      "Kemp's announcement came as President-elect Donald Trump returns to office and more state and federal officials consider Medicaid work requirements.",
      "Georgia is the only state that requires some people to work, study or volunteer to enroll in Medicaid, under the program Georgia Pathways. If the incoming Trump administration approves Kemp's plan, parents and guardians of kids up to age 6 in households at or below 100% of the federal poverty level could receive Medicaid without meeting those requirements.",
      "\u201cIn a growing state that needs more Georgians in the workforce than ever before, providing health insurance to a family or individual with young children may be the last piece they need to restart a career and be on the path for a brighter future,\u201d Kemp said.",
      "Most states cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level with primarily federal funds. Kemp has championed Georgia Pathways as an alternative to expanding Medicaid for low-income adults. Enrollees have to complete 80 hours of work, volunteer activity, schooling or vocational rehabilitation a month to receive coverage. Kemp says the goal is to ease them into a job that provides private insurance.",
      "Georgia Pathways had a rough start. After its first year, the program had around 4,300 members, a sliver of those who are eligible. Health policy experts have called the program a \u201cfailure,\" saying the requirements are too burdensome a large number of struggling people.",
      "Opponents also say the program has wasted money. Nonprofit health policy research organization KFF reports the program has costed more than $40 million in state and federal tax dollars that have been spent mostly on administrative costs rather than medical care. Others complain about sign-up complications and the program's slow processing times.",
      "In a written statement, state Senate Democrats called the new plan \u201cdamage control\u201d for the Georgia Pathways program.",
      "\u201cThere are over half a million Georgians who need health insurance, and the governor\u2019s proposal falls well short of that, and we\u2019re leaving federal dollars on the table that would help close the coverage gap in Georgia,\" said Democratic state Sen. Jason Esteves, of Atlanta. \"Because of the governor\u2019s plan, we will continue to struggle to strengthen our healthcare system.\"",
      "Kemp has regularly doubled down on his commitment to Georgia Pathways.",
      "\u201cThe old system is not working,\u201d Kemp said Wednesday. \u201cAnd the other side, their only answer to any of this is they want government-run healthcare. And I am not in that boat.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirement plans in 13 states, but the Biden administration revoked these waivers in 2021. Georgia Pathways survived after a legal fight.",

      "He said the Biden administration has meanwhile \u201cunfortunately been more interested in finding ways to stop or undermine our efforts rather than working with us.\u201d",

      "Food and Drug Administration officials granted a 2022 petition filed by two dozen food safety and health advocates, who urged the agency to revoke authorization for the substance that gives some candies, snack cakes and maraschino cherries a bright red hue.",
      "The agency said it was taking the action as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d because some studies have found that the dye caused cancer in lab rats. Officials cited a statute known as the Delaney Clause, which requires FDA to ban any additive found to cause cancer in people or animals.",
      "The dye is known as erythrosine, FD&C Red No. 3 or Red 3. The ban removes it from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines, such as cough syrups. More than three decades ago, the FDA declined to authorize use of Red 3 in cosmetics and externally applied drugs because a study showed it caused cancer when eaten by rats.",
      "\u201cThe FDA is taking action that will remove the authorization for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods. \u201cEvidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No.3. Importantly, the way that FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not occur in humans.\u201d",
      "Food manufacturers will have until January 2027 to remove the dye from their products, while makers of ingested drugs have until January 2028 to do the same. Other countries still allow for certain uses of the dye, but imported foods must meet the new U.S. requirement.",
      "Consumer advocates praised the decision.",
      "\u201cThis is a welcome, but long overdue, action from the FDA: removing the unsustainable double standard in which Red 3 was banned from lipstick but permitted in candy,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, director of the group Center for Science in the Public Interest, which led the petition effort.",
      "It's not clear whether the ban will face legal challenges from food manufacturers because evidence hasn\u2019t determined that the dye causes cancer when consumed by humans. At a hearing in December, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf suggested that's a risk.",
      "\u201cWhen we do ban something, it will go to court,\u201d he told members of Congress on Dec. 5. \u201cAnd if we don't have the scientific evidence, we will lose in court.\u201d",
      "When the FDA declined to allow Red 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs in 1990, the color additive was already permitted in foods and ingested drugs. Because research showed then that the way the dye causes cancer in rats does not apply to humans, \"the FDA did not take action to revoke the authorization of Red No. 3 in food,\u201d the agency has said on its website.",
      "Health advocates for years have asked the FDA to reconsider that decision, including the 2022 petition led by CSPI. In November, nearly two dozen members of Congress sent a letter demanding that FDA officials ban Red 3.",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal officials on Wednesday released a far-reaching proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine content, a goal long sought by antismoking advocates that is unlikely to go into effect anytime soon.",
      "The proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration comes in the final days of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, greatly reducing the likelihood that it will actually be enacted. President-elect Donald Trump and his health nominees have not commented on the measure, but a similar effort led by Trump\u2019s first FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, was sidelined during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s health secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said little about how regulating tobacco fits into his plans to overhaul the government's approach to fighting chronic disease. Even if the effort goes ahead under Trump, tobacco companies like Reynolds American and Altria are almost certain to challenge it in court, delaying implementation.",
      "The FDA has spent years studying the issue and said Wednesday that reducing nicotine would help nearly 13 million current smokers quit cigarettes within one year. Roughly 48 million more young people would never take up the habit because cigarettes would essentially become nonaddictive, according to agency projections.",
      "Under the agency's plan, nicotine would be capped at levels that \u201ccould no longer create and sustain this addiction among people who smoke.\u201d The agency's 334-page analysis was posted online in the federal register Wednesday morning.",
      "Antismoking advocates overwhelmingly back the idea and urged Kennedy to help implement it, if he is confirmed.",
      "\u201cTobacco regulation is a huge part of reaching the goals he\u2019s outlined for reducing chronic disease and a really important part of the conversation we need to have in this country,\u201d said Chrissie Juliano of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents the heads of more than 30 metropolitan health departments",
      "Smoking causes more than 480,000 U.S. deaths each year due to cancer, heart disease, stroke and other smoking-related illnesses. Those conditions often take decades to develop and remain elevated today despite ongoing declines in smoking among adults and teenagers.",
      "The idea of limiting nicotine has its roots in sweeping powers given to the FDA by Congress in 2009 to regulate the tobacco industry. But the FDA\u2019s efforts on nicotine and a host of other tobacco measures \u2014 such as adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packs \u2014 have been hampered for years by tobacco industry lawsuits.",
      "Under the law, FDA regulators can regulate nicotine but they cannot remove it completely. The agency's ability to set a maximum nicotine threshold is unique worldwide and the attempt would represent a first in global efforts to reduce smoking-related deaths.",
      "Currently, there are no U.S. limits on nicotine, which occurs naturally in tobacco plants. There are several techniques for removing it, including chemical extraction and cross-breeding plants.",
      "The FDA formally announced it would begin work on the proposed rule in 2022 and regulators received thousands of public comments from tobacco companies, retailers, health experts and consumers.",
      "The latest FDA announcement comes as smoking in the U.S. continues to fall. Last year, the smoking rate hit another all-time low of just 1 in 9 adults saying they currently smoke.",
      "Low-nicotine cigarettes are not a new idea. Several companies, including Philip Morris, experimented with selling the products during the 1980s and 1990s, without much success. In 2019, the FDA authorized a cigarette that contains 95% less nicotine than standard cigarettes.",
      "The FDA has sponsored studies showing that when smokers switch to very low nicotine cigarettes they smoke less and are more likely to try quitting. That research is considered pivotal to establishing that smokers won\u2019t compensate by just smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply. That was sometimes the case with \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d cigarettes marketed in decades past. Those products were subsequently banned as misleading.",

      "While the pandemic's emergency phase ended in May 2023, the threat of infection remains a governing force in the lives of people like Scarbro. They protect themselves from the virus with masks and isolate themselves in small family bubbles. Some grasp for unproven strategies \u2014 gargling with antiseptic mouthwash, carrying a personal carbon dioxide monitor to check the ventilation of indoor spaces.",
      "In online support groups, they trade research about the danger of repeat infections and cognitive impairment. They miss the empathy they felt during the early days of the pandemic. Some have lost friendships, but they strive to maintain the social ties that are important to mental health.",
      "Scarbro\u2019s bowling league helps her feel connected to her neighbors. But recently, she\u2019s detected more stares and skeptical looks from strangers when she bowls in a mask.",
      "\u201cThere was more respect and understanding, but now they\u2019re over it,\" she said. \"They expect me to be over it, but they don\u2019t understand that even before COVID-19, these were the precautions I needed to take.\u201d",
      "Most Americans have developed some level of protection against severe disease from previous COVID-19 infections, vaccinations or both. But immunocompromised people like Scarbro, who has common variable immune deficiency, must be constantly vigilant. Unlike the flu, COVID has not settled into a seasonal pattern.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s never a time when they can relax a little bit,\u201d said Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThat\u2019s a really challenging and exhausting thing to ask someone to do.\u201d",
      "Who are the people still cautious about COVID-19? They include young caregivers of vulnerable relatives, people with chronic health conditions and families rallying around a loved one. In interviews with The Associated Press, they talked about how they manage the trade-offs and the toll of isolation on their mental health.",
      "Before the pandemic, Bazia Zebrowski, 61, of Newbury, Ohio, dined out, shopped for groceries and took her dog, Shadoh, to the park. When she felt well, she occasionally could get together with friends despite having myalgic encephalomyelitis, a condition formerly known as chronic fatigue syndrome that causes inflammation, immune system problems, fatigue and pain.",
      "Now she keeps close to home, venturing out only for medical appointments. Her husband does the shopping and wears a mask at his workplace.",
      "They have not had COVID-19 and hope their luck holds. Getting sick would be a disaster, she said, potentially triggering a relapse or superimposing long COVID-19 onto her illness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself COVID cautious. I consider myself COVID competent,\u201d Zebrowski said. \u201cCautious would imply that I have an unreasonable fear of something. I do not have an unreasonable fear of this disease.\u201d",
      "What does Zebrowski miss about pre-pandemic times? \u201cI miss the illusion that people are willing to care for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHow hard is it to put a mask on? It rattles your faith in humankind \u2026 (you learn) how little the people in your life understood how sick you were to begin with.\u201d",
      "Trauma is part of the experience of having a chronic illness, said DePaul University psychologist Leonard Jason, who has studied myalgic encephalomyelitis for more than three decades.",
      "\u201cThen you're traumatized by the societal reaction to the illness,\" he said.",
      "Some people aren\u2019t sick themselves but are taking precautions to protect a family member. Steve Alejandro, 42, of Wentzville, Missouri, calls himself a COVID shielder.",
      "His wife, Ashley Alejandro, 44, also has myalgic encephalomyelitis. \u201cShe\u2019s got maybe four good hours a day,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a thing in the world I wouldn\u2019t do to protect those four hours.\u201d",
      "Alejandro changed careers during the pandemic, leaving behind \u201cmy whole support system\u201d so he could sell vintage books online from home. His three children \u2014 now 20, 18 and 12 \u2014 never went back to in-person school after lockdowns ended and are continuing their learning at home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve really come together,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThis is a choice that can be made and you can win at it.\u201d",
      "In Miami, Kira Levin is the primary caregiver for her 98-year-old grandmother. She said the thought of getting COVID-19 and risking her grandmother\u2019s health is terrifying.",
      "So, at a July wedding, the 29-year-old was the only bridesmaid and attendee in a mask \u2014 an N95 layered with a pretty mask to match the bride\u2019s green color scheme.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t take off the mask for pictures and nobody asked me to,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd I felt incredibly grateful for that.\u201d",
      "Denver-based sisters Jacqueline and Alexa Child stay masked while going to concerts and dining outdoors with friends who don\u2019t share the same level of COVID-19 caution.",
      "\u201cWe have done everything we possibly could to maintain our mental health and our social life,\u201d said Jacqueline, who has an immune disease that makes her vulnerable to infections. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than being disabled and isolated. As someone who has been disabled and isolated, I don\u2019t want that isolation part.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline, 30, and her sister Alexa, 34, launched a dating app in 2022 for people who are disabled or chronically ill, though all are welcomed. Users can add a \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d tag to their profiles to signal they\u2019re interested in meeting others who take precautions. The Child sisters say 10% of their 30,000 users add \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d to their dating profiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a market that we didn\u2019t expect to target but we happily accept,\u201d Jacqueline said.",
      "Alexa said the precautions started as a way to protect Jacqueline, \u201cbut they\u2019re no longer about that.\u201d She\u2019s trying to avoid long COVID, a long-term disability.",
      "Tossing aside the threat of long COVID is hard to imagine for Yale University immunologist Akiko Iwasaki. Though people have been studying the virus since its emergence, she said scientists still don\u2019t know how pieces of the virus can stick around in the blood of some people for more than a year after they\u2019ve recovered from the illness.",
      "Iwasaki still wears masks indoors and stays up to date with vaccines.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t afford to get sick and become chronically ill,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that we really are in a position to be able to better understand the disease, to help millions of people.\u201d",
      "While Scarbro understands that others are ready to return to \u201cnormal,\u201d it\u2019s not that easy for her or her family. It's true for many others with chronic immune illnesses, said Jorey Berry, CEO of Immune Deficiency Foundation.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world is able to kind of go back to their regular lives, our community doesn\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d she said.",
      "Scarbro, her husband and children are constantly taking into account other people\u2019s COVID-19 safety practices.",
      "And as the world turns back to pre-COVID life, Scarbro's family is doing what they can to keep her healthy \u2014 but not in complete isolation.",
      "\u201cI feel very scared about the future,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that people are done, and I respect that, but it\u2019s only going to make it harder for me and my family to keep me safe.\u201d",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency Monday after the country reported its second case of mpox in less than four days, health authorities said.",
      "Neither case had known recent contact with infected animals or other sick individuals, the health ministry said. Only the first case involved recent travel, limited to the airport town of Lungi in the northern Port Loko District between Dec. 26 and Jan. 6th. Both patients are receiving treatment at a hospital in the capital, Freetown.",
      "Mpox, also known as monkeypox, was first identified by scientists in 1958 when outbreaks of a \u201cpox-like\u201d disease in monkeys occurred. Until recently, most human cases were seen in people in central and West Africa who had close contact with infected animals.",
      "In 2022, the virus was confirmed to spread via sex for the first time and triggered outbreaks in more than 70 countries across the world that had not previously reported mpox. The Congo has borne the brunt of the epidemic, with a vast majority of the roughly 43,000 suspected cases and 1,000 deaths in Africa this year.",
      "Sierra Leone was previously the epicenter of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the deadliest in history. The outbreak, primarily concentrated in West Africa, affected Sierra Leone the most, with nearly 4,000 deaths out of the more than 11,000 recorded globally. The country also lost 7% of its healthcare workforce to the outbreak.",

    "summary": "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
    "story": [
      "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",
      "\u201cNot right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not in the foreseeable future.\u201d",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's initial \u201cpeace formula\u201d demanded Russia\u2019s full withdrawal from all occupied territories, but he later softened his position as Moscow continued to make gains, and he is no longer making that retreat a condition for talks. Zelenskyy has faced reluctance from some allies to offer Kyiv quick membership in NATO, but he insists on strong security guarantees from the U.S. and other Western partners as the key element of any prospective peace deal.",
      "Zelenskyy has emphasized the need for a comprehensive agreement, not a temporary halt to hostilities that would only allow Russia to replenish its arsenal. He has pushed for the deployment of Western troops to Ukraine as peacekeepers.",
      "Putin has similarly rejected a temporary truce, pointing out that Russian troops are pressing an offensive and any break in the fighting would allow Ukraine to get reinforcements and supplies.",
      "\u201cThe Russians are seeing that Trump is going to push for some kind of resolution or some kind of settlement, and they want to grab as much as they can,\u201d said Kurt Volker, who served as special representative for Ukraine in Trump's first term.",
      "Russia controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that was annexed illegally in 2014. It held the battlefield initiative for most of 2024, pressing offensives in several sections of the over 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. Moscow\u2019s gains in the fall were the largest since the opening stage of the invasion.",
      "Ukraine has faced dire manpower shortages as it struggles to mobilize enough recruits to compensate for its losses and increasing desertions.",
      "Michael Kofman, a senior fellow with Carnegie Endowment, observed that \u201cstabilizing the front line is essential to buying time and forcing Moscow to reassess.\u201d He noted that Ukraine\u2019s mobilization rates fell considerably since summer and \u201cmanning levels continued to decline, especially among infantry units holding the front lines.\u201d",
      "Moscow-based military analyst Sergei Poletaev noted that even though Russia lacks resources for a major breakthrough, it has refined the tactic of small-scale, slow advances in multiple sectors.",
      "\u201cMoscow is betting on the physical exhaustion of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian state\u2019s meltdown,\u201d Poletaev wrote recently.",
      "Kyiv sought to change its fortunes by launching an incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region in August, aiming to distract Moscow's forces in eastern Ukraine and strengthen its hand in negotiations. Russia, initially caught by surprise, intensified efforts to drive out the Ukrainian forces. The U.S., Ukraine and South Korea said North Korea sent 10,000- 12,000 troops to Russia to fight in the Kursk region.",
      "Kellogg, the new administration's nominee for Ukraine envoy, dismissed European fears that Trump could reduce support for Kyiv, saying \u201che\u2019s not trying to give something to Putin or to the Russians, he\u2019s actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Volker predicted Trump would urge Putin to end hostilities and warn him that he would sharply increase pressure on Moscow if the Russian leader fails to heed the demand.",
      "If Putin refuses to halt the fighting, Volker said Trump would \u201copen up the spigot\u201d and allow Ukraine to borrow as much money as it wants and buy whatever military equipment it wants while toughening sanctions on Russian oil and gas sector.",
      "\u201cI think those things would be aimed at driving Putin to conclude, \u2018OK, it\u2019s time to stop,\u2019\u201d Volker said.",
      "Other observers warn that Putin would be unlikely to compromise on his war goals, particularly while Russian troops have the upper hand in Ukraine, and the Russian economy has so far survived ongoing Western sanctions.",
      "While seeking to cement his gains and win Western guarantees that Ukraine will never be invited to join NATO, Putin also wants Kyiv to accept a set of language, education and cultural policies to ensure its friendly policies toward Moscow.",
      "\u201cPutin has tied his war to achieving this and is unlikely to retreat,\u201d Tatyana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center wrote in a commentary. \u201cInstead, he will likely intensify efforts.\u201d",
      "She added that Russia\u2019s demand for Ukraine\u2019s \u201cdemilitarization\u201d implies not only deep cuts in its armed forces but also seeks Western guarantees it won't rearm its ally.",
      "\u201cMoscow views any military support for Ukraine as inherently hostile,\u201d she said.",
      "Putin is unlikely to walk back his annexation of the four Ukrainian regions, a seizure that already has been written into the Russian constitution.",
      "\u201cMoscow believes that a recognition of Russia\u2019s new borders by Ukraine is necessary to preclude the basis for a military revanche,\u201d political analyst Vladimir Frolov said in a commentary.",
      "Many Moscow analysts are skeptical of prospects for a peace deal, noting the widely divergent positions on both sides. Some say a failure in the talks could put Russia and the U.S. on the brink of a direct conflict if Trump decides to ramp up military support for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThey tend to think in the West that Putin will get scared and agree to a ceasefire,\u201d wrote Poletaev, the Moscow-based analyst. \u201cJust the opposite. Putin will likely opt for an escalation and fight fire with fire.\"",

    "summary": "A train station in Damascus was once the pride of the Syrian capital, an essential link between Europe and the Arabian Peninsula during the Ottoman Empire and then a national transit hub",
    "story": [
      "A train station in Damascus was once the pride of the Syrian capital, an essential link between Europe and the Arabian Peninsula during the Ottoman Empire and then a national transit hub",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- A train station in Damascus was once the pride of the Syrian capital, an essential link between Europe and the Arabian Peninsula during the Ottoman Empire and then a national transit hub. But more than a decade of war left it a wasteland of bullet-scarred walls and twisted steel.",
      "The Qadam station's remaining staff say they still have an attachment to the railway and hope that it, like the country, can be revived after the swift and stunning downfall of leader Bashar Assad last month.",
      "On a recent day, train operator Mazen Malla led The Associated Press through the landscape of charred train cars and workshops damaged by artillery fire. Bullet casings littered the ground.",
      "Malla grew up near the station. His father, uncles and grandfather all worked there. Eventually he was driving trains himself, spending more than 12 hours a day at work.",
      "\u201cThe train is a part of us,\" he said with a deep, nostalgic sigh, as he picked up what appeared to be a spent artillery shell and tossed it aside. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t see my kids as much as I would see the train.\u201d",
      "The Qadam station was the workhorse of the iconic Hejaz Railway that was built under the Ottoman Empire\u2019s Sultan Abdulhamid II in the early 1900s, linking Muslim pilgrims from Europe and Asia via what is now Turkey to the holy city of Medina in present-day Saudi Arabia. The line also transported troops and equipment for the empire that controlled large swaths of the Arabian Peninsula.",
      "That glory was short-lived. The railway soon became a target of Arab fighters in an armed uprising during World War I backed by Britain, France and other Allied forces that eventually took down the Ottoman Empire.",
      "In the following decades, Syria used its section of the railway to transport people between Damascus and its second city of Aleppo, along with several towns and neighboring Jordan. While the main station, still intact a few miles away, later became a historical site and events hall, Qadam remained the busy home of the workshops and people making the railway run.",
      "As train cars were upgraded, the old wooden ones were placed in a museum. The Qadam station, however, retained its structure of Ottoman stone and French bricks from Marseille.",
      "But war tore it apart after Assad's crackdown on protesters demanding greater freedoms.",
      "\u201cThe army turned this into a military base,\u201d Malla said. Workers like him were sent away.",
      "Qadam station was too strategic for soldiers to ignore. It gave Assad's forces a vantage point on key rebel strongholds in Damascus. Up a flight of stairs, an office became a sniper's nest.",
      "Slogans praising Assad and the Lebanese Hezbollah militant group, a key ally of the ousted leader, can still be seen on the walls.",
      "\u201cWe will kneel and kiss wherever Assad walks,\u201d one says.",
      "The nearby neighborhood of Al-Assali is now mostly in ruins after becoming a no man\u2019s land between the station and the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk that became a rebel stronghold and was besieged and bombarded for years by government forces.",
      "The fighting entered the railway station at least once, in 2013. Footage widely circulated online showed rebels firing assault rifles and taking cover behind trains.",
      "Malla and his family fled their home near the station to a nearby neighborhood. He heard the fighting but prayed that the station that had long been his family's livelihood would be left unscathed.",
      "Assad's forces cleared the rebels from Damascus in 2018. The train station, though badly wrecked, was opened again, briefly, as a symbol of triumph and revival. Syrian state media reported that trains would take passengers to the annual Damascus International Fair. It broadcast images of happy passengers by the entrance and at the destination, but not of the station's vast damage.",
      "Syria\u2019s railway never returned to its former prosperity under Assad, and Malla stayed away as the military maintained control of much of Qadam. After Assad was ousted and the insurgents who forced him out became the interim administration, Malla returned.",
      "He found his home destroyed. The station, which he described as \u201cpart of my soul,\u201d was badly damaged.",
      "\u201cWhat we saw was tragic,\u201d he said. \"It was unbelievable. It was heartbreaking.\u201d",
      "The train cars were battered and burned. Some were piles of scrap. The museum had been looted and the old trains had been stripped for sale on Syria\u2019s black market.",
      "\u201cEverything was stolen. Copper, electric cables and tools \u2014 they were all gone,\u201d Malla said.",
      "The trains' distinctive wooden panels had disappeared. Malla and others believe that Assad's fighters used them as firewood during the harsh winters.",
      "In the former no man's land, packs of stray dogs barked and searched for food. Railway workers and families living at the train station say an urban legend spread that the dogs ate the bodies of captives that Assad\u2019s notorious web of intelligence agencies killed and dumped late at night.",
      "Now Malla and others hope the railway can be cleared of its rubble and its dark past and become a central part of Syria's economic revival after war and international isolation. They dream of the railway helping to return the country to its former status as a key link between Europe and the Middle East.",
      "There is much work to be done. About 90% of Syria's population of over 23 million people live in poverty, according to the United Nations. Infrastructure is widely damaged. Western sanctions, imposed during the war, continue.",
      "But already, neighboring Turkey has expressed interest in restoring the railway line to Damascus as part of efforts to boost trade and investment.",
      "That prospect excites Malla, whose son Malek spent much of his teenage years surviving the war. At his age, his father and uncle were already learning how to operate a steam engine.",
      "\u201cI hope there will soon be job opportunities, so my son can be employed,\u201d Malla said. \u201cThat way he can revive the lineage of his grandfather, and the grandfather of his grandfather.\""

      "Lawyers for South Korea\u2019s impeached president say he will appear at a hearing in a Seoul court to oppose a formal arrest over last month\u2019s imposition of martial law",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s impeached president will appear at a hearing in a Seoul court on Saturday to oppose a formal arrest over last month\u2019s imposition of martial law, his lawyers said.",
      "Yoon, who has been in detention since he was apprehended on Wednesday in a massive law enforcement operation at his residence, faces potential rebellion charges linked to his declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, which set off the country\u2019s most serious political crisis since its democratization in the late 1980s.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and the military, requested the Seoul Western District Court to grant a warrant for Yoon\u2019s formal arrest. Yoon is expected to argue that there\u2019s no need for him to be in custody during an investigation at a hearing set for 2 p.m. this afternoon. The judge is anticipated to make a decision by late Saturday or early Sunday.",
      "Hundreds of Yoon's supporters rallied overnight at the court, calling for his release.",
      "If Yoon is arrested, investigators can extend his detention to 20 days, during which they will transfer the case to public prosecutors for indictment. If the court rejects the investigators\u2019 request, Yoon will be released and return to his residence.",
      "The crisis began when Yoon, in an attempt to break through legislative gridlock, imposed military rule and sent troops to the National Assembly and election offices. The standoff lasted only hours after lawmakers who managed to get through a blockade voted to lift the measure. The opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14."

      "The aid was announced by Mexico\u2019s Secretary of Foreign Affairs Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente after a two-day closed meeting with ministers and representatives of 11 countries of the region.",
      "The meeting \u2013 led by De la Fuente and the Honduran foreign minister in the Mexican capital \u2013 was the latest in a series of regional summits aimed at building a comprehensive regional response to the unprecedented levels of migration across the Americas. Government leaders of Colombia, Cuba, Guatemala, Haiti, Venezuela, Brazil, Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador participated.",

      "A team of doctors in Israel is preparing for the return of the hostages from Gaza with the expectation that many are likely to have severe, life-threatening complications from spending more than a year in captivity",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel is preparing for the return of the hostages from Gaza with the expectation that many are likely to have severe, life-threatening complications after more than a year in captivity in the Gaza Strip.",
      "While it\u2019s impossible to know the exact conditions in which hostages have been held, the Health Ministry and the Hostages Family Forum, which represents families of the hostages, are preparing for several different scenarios based on information gathered from hostages previously released or rescued.",
      "Hamas militants abducted about 250 people during a cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that also left 1,200 people dead. About 100 hostages are still being held, though Israel believes a third of them are no longer alive.",
      "The war that followed the attack has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed.",
      "Hagai Levine, who heads the health team at the Hostages Families Forum, said he expects the hostages to return with cardiovascular and respiratory issues due to lack of ventilation in the tunnels. Among multiple other afflictions Levine expects are vitamin deficiencies, starvation, dramatic weight loss, vision problems due to a lack of sunlight, broken bones, cognitive impairment and mental health trauma.",
      "As a result, doctors are expecting the hostages will require longer and more complex medical and mental health interventions than did those who returned after the last ceasefire in November 2023, said Dr. Einat Yehene, a psychologist at the Hostages Families Forum who oversees the captives\u2019 rehabilitation.",
      "Doctors are keenly aware of the challenges they face in treating the surviving hostages. One of them is \u201crefeeding syndrome,\u201d when exposure to certain foods or too much food can lead to profound health complications and even death in those with prolonged vitamin and nutritional deficiencies, said Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Ministry of Health\u2019s medical directorate.",
      "The Red Cross team that will transfer the hostages from Gaza to Egypt and the small Israeli military medical team that will meet the hostages at the border as they cross into Israel have strict guidelines for what the hostages can eat in their first few hours, Mizrahi said.",
      "Six hospitals are preparing to receive hostages, including two in the south, closer to Gaza, that will treat those with acute medical issues, health ministry officials said.",
      "Yehene said the public should not expect joyful reunions like those seen following the last ceasefire, when released hostages ran through hospital halls into the ecstatic embraces of their loved ones.",
      "\u201cGiven the physical and emotional conditions, we expect emotional withdrawal symptoms, such as maybe exhaustion, fatigue \u2014 and some will probably need assistance with their mobility,\u201d she said.",
      "Medical officials are also prepared for the possibility that returning hostages will need speech therapy, especially if they have been kept in isolation, Yehene noted. She said some might be so traumatized or in shock from the transfer to Israel that they will be unable to speak at all.",
      "To minimize the hostages' trauma and allow them to acclimate to their new reality, officials will try to limit the number of people who interact with them and have made accommodations to lessen their sensory stimulation, such as stripping down the hospital rooms and changing the lighting.",
      "Israel\u2019s Ministry of Social Welfare has also planned temporary housing solutions if hostages feel unable to return directly from the hospital to their home.",
      "Experts are pleading with the news media and the public to give the hostages and their families privacy, despite intense interest in their plight.",
      "\u201cThe first days back are really holy, when a person finally gets to meet with their family, and everyone else needs to take a step back,\u201d said Ofrit Shapira, a psychoanalyst who heads a group of health professionals treating freed hostages, their families, and survivors of the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "Hospital wings housing the hostages are expected to be \u201csterilized,\u201d closed to all but direct family and doctors, to keep the public and news outlets away, medical officials have said.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much we care about them; they\u2019re their own people, they\u2019re not \u2018ours,\u2019\u201d Shapira added. She noted that asking the hostages direct questions about their experiences can force them to relive their trauma. She said it's best to allow them to release information at their own pace.",
      "\u201cOur curiosity is really not important compared with what the hostages need,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much you volunteered or were active in this fight; they don\u2019t owe you anything.\u201d",
      "Some of the previously freed hostages and their families have volunteered to help counsel those now going through the same process, Levine said. He noted the strength of the bonds created between the relatives of the hostages, and between the released hostages, who have become like \u201cpsychological families\u201d helping each other adapt and heal, he said.",
      "Many released hostages are neglecting their own rehabilitation because they are so wrapped up in the fight to bring the others home, Levine said.",
      "A big priority is also to provide support for the families of hostages who did not survive.",
      "Israel has confirmed the deaths of at least a third of the approximately 90 remaining captives. But Hamas has not confirmed the status of the 33 who are expected to be freed in the first stage of the ceasefire. Some might no longer be alive.",
      "\u201cThis moment of the releases is an emotional and psychological trigger for something they were supposed to experience, and they never will experience, because this deal took too long,\u201d Yehene said."

In retirement, he drove to the Erez border crossing on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip once a week to ferry Palestinians to medical appointments in Israel as part of a group called On the Way to Recovery.",
      "Oded is most proud of his work on behalf of the traditionally nomadic Bedouin people of the Negev Desert, his daughter said, describing a case that went to Israel\u2019s High Court and resulted in the return of some of their land.",
      "That deep-seated hope for co-existence was evident when the militants released Lifschitz\u2019s mother, Yocheved, on Oct. 23, 2023. Just before leaving Gaza, Yocheved turned to her captors and said \u201cshalom,\u2019\u2019 the Hebrew word for peace.",
      "Yocheved later described her experience as hell, saying she was beaten with sticks and held in a spider\u2019s web of tunnels with as many as 25 other hostages. But she also said her guards provided medicine to those who needed it and gave the hostages pita bread with cheese and cucumber to eat.",
      "Lifschitz said she wonders every day about her father's treatment and how he is faring.",
      "\u201cI am the last one to put words into his mouth, but I can tell you that he spent a lifetime believing that another alternative is possible for Zionism, for socialism,\u201d she said.",
      "Hamas militants killed about 1,200 Israelis and took 251 hostages during the Oct. 7 attack. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched air and ground attacks on Gaza that have killed more than 46,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "The ceasefire proposal calls for 33 hostages to be released over the next six weeks, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. The remainder, including the bodies of the dead, are to be released in a second phase that is still under negotiation. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.",
      "The contours of the agreement are strikingly similar to those negotiated by the administration of outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden in May. But Israel rejected that deal.",
      "That outraged the families of many of the captives, especially after hostages continued to die.",
      "The families have pushed hard for their loved ones\u2019 release, leading a series of protests to force the Israeli government to live up to its promise to bring the hostages home. They have also crisscrossed the globe, meeting with presidents, prime ministers and even the pope to keep the hostages at the center of negotiations.",
      "\u201cSo many people were killed that should have been alive if they did not sabotage this deal,\u201d Lifschitz said. \u201cI hope that they know they will have to live with that for the rest of their life, and we will remind them. We will remind them of ... the suffering of both sides their action brought about.\u201d",
      "But even as she describes the anguish of the past 15 months, Lifschitz says she hopes the pain experienced by people on both sides of the conflict will breed compassion among both Israelis and Palestinians.",
      "\u201cWe are about to receive our loved ones after so long where we were unable to love and care for them.\u2019\u2019 She said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much trauma. I think people have to have a little softness toward it all, just feel it a bit in their hearts.",
      "\u201cI think feeling the pain of others is the start of building something better.\u2019\u2019",
      "And if her father doesn\u2019t come back? Then what?",
      "\u201cWe will know,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cWe will know.\u2019\u2019"

      "The Gaza ceasefire and hostage release agreement is expected to take effect as soon as Sunday",
      "The Gaza ceasefire and hostage release agreemen t is expected to take effect as soon as Sunday. But the most significant diplomatic breakthrough in over a year of brutal war between Israel and Hamas is rife with risks and raises more questions than it answers.",
      "The deal presented to the Israeli Cabinet Friday after months of complex negotiations mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar is ridden with diplomatic ambiguity, leaving the issues that most inflame tensions between Israel and Hamas up for more negotiation. That has stirred fears that, failing a second agreement, the war could resume within weeks.",
      "In besieged Gaza, the prospect of more humanitarian aid and a respite from constant bombardment still has lifted Palestinians' hopes after 15 months of suffering through an Israeli military campaign has killed over 46,000 people, both civilians and militants.",
      "In Israel, families have eagerly prepared to welcome home relatives Hamas took captive during its Oct. 7 cross-border attack that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and resulted in the abduction of 250 others.",
      "Even as Israel and Hamas quarreled over final sticking points earlier this week, American and Qatari officials said the first phase of the deal \u2014 lasting 42 days \u2014 should take hold first thing Sunday.",
      "It involves the release of 33 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza \u2014 women, children men over age 50 and sick or wounded people \u2014 in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.",
      "Hamas has agreed to free three female hostages on Day 1 of the deal, four more on Day 7 and the remaining 26 over the following five weeks of this first stage.",
      "The first stage also requires that 600 humanitarian relief trucks enter the enclave each day \u2014 a significant increase from the current trickle of aid deliveries decried by the United Nations as insufficient to cover people's basic needs.",
      "In Gaza, Palestinians can expect the fighting to stop and the Israeli army to withdraw to the east, away from populated areas, allowing civilians to return to their shattered homes. Around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million people has been displaced.",
      "The majority of Palestinian prisoners slated for release, according to a partial list released by the Israeli Justice Ministry on Friday, are women and minors jailed in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem for non-violent offenses.",
      "Diplomats have sketched out further phases of the agreement in hopes that the immediate ceasefire can allow Israel and Hamas to work toward a lasting end to the war and the reconstruction of devastated Gaza.",
      "The second phase of the deal is meant to be worked out before the first one ends. To convince both sides to sign on to the ceasefire, foreign mediators seem to have left that second phase particularly ambiguous.",
      "The broad outline says all remaining hostages in Gaza, both alive and dead, are to be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the strip and a \u201csustainable calm.\u201d",
      "The talks are bound to be tricky, given the participants\u2019 antagonisms and sharply different goals.",

      "Hamas is badly battered but still controls much of Gaza and has said that it will only agree to a deal that permanently ends the war. It has refused to hand over the last Israeli hostages \u2014 around 100 are still in Gaza \u2014 until Israel removes all of its troops.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hoping to persuade his far-right allies to remain in his wobbly governing coalition despite their opposition to a ceasefire, has offered the public no guarantees that Israel will make it to Phase 2. That leaves many families afraid that loved ones still in Gaza will be left behind.",
      "Itamar Ben-Gvir, the hardline minister for national security, announced Thursday night that his ultranationalist Jewish Power party would quit the government over the ceasefire, and only return if fighting resumed. Israel\u2019s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, also demanded that Netanyahu promise to continue the war in Gaza after freeing some of the hostages as a condition of Smotrich's Religious Zionism staying in the government.",
      "Few believe that the ceasefire will address the underlying causes of the war.",
      "\u201cNo one can promise that Hamas will keep its word and execute the second stage,\u201d Amos Harel, a military affairs columnist for the Israeli paper Haaretz, wrote on Friday. \"And many are suspicious of Netanyahu\u2019s intentions.\""

      "The scandal stems from reports that began in December by the Shukan Bunshun weekly magazine that Nakai had reached a 90 million yen ($580,000) settlement with a woman in connection with alleged sexual misconduct at a dinner party last year.",
      "Nakai acknowledged in a Jan. 9 statement on his official website that he had reached a settlement with a woman over \u201ca trouble.\u201d He denied using any violence or anyone else's involvement, saying he sincerely responded to the woman\u2019s requests in the settlement.",

      "\u201cThe lack of consistency and, importantly, transparency in both reporting the facts and the subsequent unforgivable shortcomings in your response merit serious condemnation that serves not only to undermine viewer trust, but also leads directly to erode shareholder value.

They were arrested in October 2023 on charges of involvement with extremist groups, as Navalny\u2019s networks were deemed by authorities.",
      "The case was widely seen as a way to increase pressure on the opposition to discourage defense lawyers from taking political cases.",

      "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s trip to Lebanon, his first in more than four years, follows a 60-day ceasefire deal that aims to end the war. France helped broker the deal and a French officer is a member of the committee that is supervising the truce, which went into effect on Nov. 27.",
      "Shortly after, Lebanon's parliament overcame a stalemate that had left the presidency vacant for over two years. That cleared the way for the naming of nomination of a permanent prime minister, prominent jurist and diplomat Nawaf Salam.",
      "Lebanon's government hopes the political breakthrough will boost international confidence and clear the way for the release funds needed for reconstruction caused by the Israel-Hezbollah war, which killed more than 4,000 and wounded over 16,000 in Lebanon. An international conference for Lebanon in Paris in October raised $1 billion in pledges for humanitarian aid and military support.",
      "Macron was received at Beirut\u2019s international airport by caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and was expected to head to the country\u2019s south, where French troops are deployed part of a U.N. peacekeeping force along the border with Israel.",
      "\u201cThis is a message of gratitude,\u201d Macron told journalists at the airport.",
      "The French leader has been a harsh critic of Lebanon\u2019s political class, whom many blame for the decades of corruption and mismanagement that led in October 2019 to the country\u2019s worst economic and financial crisis.",
      "For years, Macron has pressed Lebanese officials to implement reforms to help the former French protectorate out of an economic crisis that the World Bank described as among the worst the world has witnessed in more than a century. Few steps have been taken by the country\u2019s rulers since then.",
      "Macron is scheduled to meet Salam and President Joseph Aoun. Aoun and the prime minister-designate have promised to work on getting Lebanon out of its economic crisis and to impose state authority over parts of the country long controlled by Hezbollah.",
      "\u201cPresident Macron promised to keep support for the new government,\u201d Mikati said after meeting the French leader at the airport. He added that Macron will meet early Friday with the U.S. and French officers on the ceasefire monitoring committee and will later meet Lebanese officials.",
      "Asked if France can guarantee that Israel will withdraw its troops from Lebanon, by the end of the 60-day truce, Mikati said this was not discussed, adding that the French side is following the matter with U.S. officials.",
      "The Israel-Hezbollah war has weakened Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group that dominated Lebanese politics for years. Hezbollah favored other candidates for president and prime minister and has criticized the choices of Aoun and Salam.",
      "Macron last visited Lebanon in August 2020, days after a massive port blast in Beirut killed over 200 people and wounded thousands."

      "PARACHINAR, Pakistan -- The death toll from a rocket and gun attack on an aid convoy in restive northwestern Pakistan has jumped to at least five, local authorities said Friday.",
      "The attack happened Thursday when trucks carrying food, medicine and other relief supplies for hundreds of thousands of besieged residents were heading to Kurram, a district hit by sectarian violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",
      "Authorities initially said a security officer was killed in the attack, but Shaukat Ali, a district administrator in Kurram, said on Friday that another officer had died at a hospital and the bodies of three missing truck drivers had been found.",
      "He said five drivers were still missing and their trucks had been burned by the attackers.",
      "No one has claimed responsibility for the attack in Kurram, which has been the scene of violence between Shiite and Sunni tribes since July 2024. The violence surged in November when attackers opened fire on vehicles carrying passengers, killing 52 people, mostly Shiites. Since then, at least 130 people have died in violence there.",
      "Thursday's attack came weeks after the government secured a ceasefire deal between tribal leaders.",
      "Shiite Muslims dominate parts of Kurram, although they are a minority in the rest of Pakistan, which is majority Sunni. The area has a history of sectarian conflict, with militant Sunni groups previously targeting minority Shiites."

    "story": [
      "A mysterious airstrip being built on a remote island in Yemen is nearing completion, according to satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A mysterious airstrip being built on a remote island in Yemen is nearing completion, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show, one of several built in a nation mired in a stalemated war threatening to reignite.",
      "The airstrip on Abd al-Kuri Island, which rises out of the Indian Ocean near the mouth of the Gulf of Aden, could provide a key landing zone for military operations patrolling that waterway. That could be useful as commercial shipping through the Gulf and Red Sea \u2014 a key route for cargo and energy shipments heading to Europe \u2014 has halved under attacks by Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The area also has seen weapons smuggling from Iran to the rebels.",
      "The runway is likely built by the United Arab Emirates, which has long been suspected of expanding its military presence in the region and has backed a Saudi-led war against the Houthis.",
      "While the Houthis have linked their campaign to the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, experts worry a ceasefire in that conflict may not be enough to see the rebels halt a campaign that's drawn them global attention. Meanwhile, the Houthis have lobbed repeated attacks at Israel, as well as U.S. warships operating in the Red Sea, raising fears that one may make it through and endanger the lives of American service members.",
      "A battlefield miscalculation by Yemen\u2019s many adversarial parties, new fatal attacks on Israel or a deadly assault on an American warship easily could shatter the country\u2019s relative calm. And it remains unclear just how President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on Monday, will handle the emboldened rebel group.",
      "\u201cThe Houthis feed off war \u2014 war is good for them,\u201d said Wolf-Christian Paes, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who studies Yemen. \u201cFinally they can live up to their slogan, which famously, of course, declares, \u2018Death to America, death to the Jews.\u2019 They see themselves as being in this epic battle against their archenemies and from their view, they're winning.\u201d",
      "Satellite photos taken Jan. 7 by Planet Labs PBC for the AP show trucks and other heavy equipment on the north-south runway built into Abd al-Kuri, which is about 35 kilometers (21 miles) in length and about 5 kilometers (3 miles) at its widest point.",
      "The runway has been paved, with the designation markings \u201c18\u201d and \"36\" to the airstrip's north and south respectively. As of Jan. 7, there was still a segment missing from the 2.4-kilometer- (1.5-mile-) long runway that's 45-meters (150-feet) wide. Trucks could be seen grading and laying asphalt over the missing 290-meter (950-foot) segment.",
      "Once completed, the runway's length would allow private jets and other aircraft to land there, though likely not the largest commercial aircraft or heavy bombers given its length.",
      "While within Houthi drone and missile range, the distance of Abd al-Kuri from mainland Yemen means \u201cthere\u2019s no threat of the Houthis getting on a pickup truck or a technical and going to seize it,\" said Yemen expert Mohammed al-Basha of the Basha Report risk advisory firm.",
      "The United Nations' Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization, which assigns its own set of airport codes for airfields around the world, had no information about the airstrip on Abd al-Kuri, spokesman William Raillant-Clark said. Yemen, as a member state to ICAO, should provide information about the airfield to the organization. Nearby Socotra Island already has an airport declared to the ICAO.",
      "It's not the only airfield to see an expansion in recent years. In Mocha on the Red Sea, a project to extend that city's airport now allows it to land far larger aircraft. Local officials attributed that project to the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The airfield also sits on a similar north-south path as the Abd al-Kuri airstrip and is roughly the same length.",
      "Other satellite photos from Planet Labs show yet another unclaimed runway currently under construction just south of Mocha near Dhubab, a coastal town in Yemen's Taiz governorate. An image taken by Planet for the AP on Thursday showed the runway fully built, though no markings were painted on it.",
      "Abd al-Kuri is part of the Socotra Archipelago, separated from Africa by only 95 kilometers (60 miles) and from Yemen by some 400 kilometers (250 miles). In the last decade of the Cold War, the archipelago occasionally hosted Soviet warships due to its strategic location.",
      "In recent years, the island has been overseen by Yemen's Southern Transitional Council, which advocates for Yemen to again split into a separate north and south as it was during the Cold War. The UAE has backed and armed the council as part of the Saudi-led war against the Houthis, who seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014.",
      "The UAE, home to the massive Jebel Ali port in Dubai and the logistic firm DP World, previously built a base in Eritrea that was later dismantled and attempted to build an airstrip on Mayun, or Perim, Island, in the center of the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.",
      "But unlike those efforts, the Emiratis appear likely to open the Abd al-Kuri airstrip \u2014 and have even signed their work. Just east of the runway, piles of dirt there have spelled out \u201cI LOVE UAE\u201d for months.",
      "An Emirati-flagged landing craft also was spotted off the coast of Abd al-Kuri in January 2024 and off Socotra multiple other times in the year, according to data analyzed by AP from MarineTraffic.com. That vessel previously has been associated with the UAE's military operations in Yemen.",
      "The UAE, which runs a once-a-week flight to Socotra via Abu Dhabi, have long described their efforts as aimed at getting aid to the archipelago. Asked for comment about the Abd al-Kuri airfield, the UAE similarly pointed to its aid operations.",
      "\u201cAny presence of the UAE ... is based on humanitarian grounds that is carried out in cooperation with the Yemen government and local authorities,\" the Emirati government said in a statement.",
      "\"The UAE remains steadfast in its commitment to all international endeavors aimed at facilitating the resumption of the Yemeni political process, thereby advancing the security, stability and prosperity sought by the Yemeni populace.\u201d",
      "The Southern Transitional Council and officials with Yemen's exiled government did not respond to repeated requests for comments over the airfield. The UAE's presence on Socotra has sparked tensions in the past, something the Houthis have used to portray the Emiratis as trying to colonize the island.",
      "\u201cThis plan represents a serious violation of Yemeni sovereignty and threatens the sovereignty of several neighboring countries through the espionage and sabotage operations it is expected to carry out,\u201d the Houthi-controlled SABA news agency said in November.",
      "A new airport on Abd al-Kuri could provide a new, secluded landing zone for surveillance flights around Socotra Island. That could be vital to interdict weapons smuggling from Iran to the Houthis, who remain under a U.N. arms embargo.",
      "A report to the U.N. Security Council said a January 2024 weapons seizure by the U.S. military took place off Socotra near Abd al-Kuri. That seizure, which saw two U.S. Navy SEALs lost at sea and presumed killed, involved a traditional dhow vessel that U.S. prosecutors say was involved in multiple smuggling trips on behalf of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard to the Houthis.",
      "Disrupting that weapons route, as well as the ongoing attacks by the U.S., Israel and others on the Houthis, likely have contributed to the slowing pace of the rebels' attacks in recent months. The U.S. and its partners alone have struck the Houthis over 260 times, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Next week, Trump will be the one to decide what happens to that campaign. He has experience already with how difficult fighting in Yemen can be \u2014 his first military action in his first term in 2017 saw a Navy SEAL killed in a raid on a suspected al-Qaida compound. The raid also killed more than a dozen civilians, including an 8-year-old girl.",
      "Trump may reapply a foreign terrorist organization designation on the Houthis that Biden revoked, a reimposition that the UAE backs. Marco Rubio, who Trump has nominated to be secretary of state, mentioned the Houthis several times when testifying Wednesday at his Senate confirmation hearing alongside what he described as threats from Iran and its allies.",
      "Any U.S. move could escalate the war, even with the Houthi's enigmatic supreme leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, pledging Thursday night to halt the rebels' attacks if a ceasefire deal is reached in Gaza.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see a way in 2025 that we have a de-escalation with the Houthis,\u201d said al-Basha, the Yemen expert. \u201cThe situation in Yemen is very tense. An outbreak in the war could be a reality in the next few months. I don\u2019t foresee the status quo continuing.\u201d"

      "The CBP One app has brought nearly 1 million people to the U.S. on two-year permits with eligibility to work since January 2023, but it could end under President-elect Donald Trump",
      "TIJUANA, Mexico -- A nurse who fled Cuba as part of the Caribbean nation\u2019s largest exodus in more than six decades needed a place to stay in Mexico as she waited to legally enter the U.S. using a government app. A woman who had lived her whole life in the same Tijuana neighborhood was desperate for medical help after a dog attack left her with wounds to her legs.",
      "A mutual acquaintance brought the two women together. Nurse Karla Figueredo stayed with Martha Rosales for three days in October 2023, waiting for a border appointment booked through the CBP One app and treating Rosales\u2019 dog bites. When Figueredo left for the U.S., she got Rosales\u2019 permission to give her name to other migrants.",
      "Word quickly spread and Rosales made her home part of a roster of at least three dozen migrant shelters in her hometown on the U.S.-Mexico border, temporarily housing people who use the CBP One app.",
      "\u201cI told God that if they didn\u2019t amputate my feet, I would help every Cuban,\u201d said Rosales, 45, who was using a wheelchair after being attacked by five dogs until Figueredo helped heal her wounds.",
      "CBP One has brought nearly 1 million people to the U.S. on two-year permits with eligibility to work but could go away once President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Figueredo, 25, now works as a medical assistant in the Houston area and keeps in touch with Rosales, who quit her job as a bank cleaner to focus on her migrant shelter. The people Rosales houses, mostly Cubans, refer to her as \u201c\u2019T\u00eda Martha\u201d (Aunt Martha) as she cooks pancake breakfasts, throws birthday parties and shuttles them to their CBP One appointments.",
      "Supporters say CBP One has helped bring order to the border and reduced illegal crossings. But Trump has said he would end it as part of a broader immigration crackdown. Critics say it prioritizes a lottery system over people who have long lived in the U.S. illegally while paying taxes and people who have waited years for visas.",
      "Dayron Garcia, a doctor in Cuba who heard about Rosales from a nephew, applied with his wife and children and plans to settle with a friend in Houston. He said Rosales\u2019 house \u201cfeels like family\u201d and that \u201cCBP One has been a salvation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a guarantee,\u201d Garcia, 40, said. \u201cYou enter with papers, with parole.\u201d",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection debuted CBP One near the end of Trump\u2019s first term as a way for customs brokers to schedule inspections and for visitors with short-term visas to extend stays.",
      "The Biden administration extended its use to migrants to replace an opaque patchwork of exemptions to a pandemic-related asylum ban that was then in place.",
      "CBP One is popular with Cubans, Venezuelans, Haitians and Mexicans, likely because advocates in their communities promote it.",
      "Illegal border crossings by Cubans plunged under CBP One from a peak of nearly 35,000 in April 2022 to just 97 in September.",
      "Demand for appointments has far outstripped supply, with an average of about 280,000 people competing for 1,450 daily slots toward the end of last year, according to CBP. Winners must report to a border crossing in three weeks.",
      "Migrant shelters along Mexico\u2019s border with the U.S. are now occupied primarily by people seeking the online appointments.",
      "Rosales' house is in a neighborhood with ramshackle homes where old tires are stacked to stop flash floods. Migrants watch television, play billiards, do chores and look after their children at Rosales' house or a rental home nearby. Those who don\u2019t yet have appointments work their phones for slots made available daily at eight U.S. border crossings with Mexico, a task likened to trying to buy Taylor Swift concert tickets.",
      "Rosales works throughout the night. A helper drives to the airport in an SUV Rosales bought with retirement pay from her bank job.",
      "Shortly after midnight, she shuttles guests from her house to Tijuana's main border crossing with San Diego for the day's first appointments at 5 a.m. She chats with them, smiles for photos and hugs people goodbye.",
      "By 3 a.m., she is at a television station for a four-hour shift cleaning the newsroom and fetching coffee for journalists, who give her the latest information on immigration and the city.",
      "She checks her phone for migrants needing shelter who heard about her on social media or from friends and family. Her contact list identifies them by size of party and appointment date: \u201c3 on the 16th,\u201d \u201c6 on the 17th.\u201d",
      "Rosales, one of 13 children, dropped out of school in third grade. Reading the Bible taught her enough to barely understand texts, which she generally responds to with voice messages or calls.",
      "Enrique Lucero was Tijuana's director of migrant affairs when she came to City Hall for advice. He helped Rosales establish a legal entity to raise money and made himself available for emergencies, such as when a woman missed her CBP One appointment to give birth. Lucero talked to CBP to make sure the woman and her baby got in.",
      "\u201cShe worries about them. She cries for them,\" Lucero said.",
      "Border arrests of Cubans increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and after anti-government protests in 2021. Nicaragua had recently eased rules for Cubans to fly from Havana, allowing them to avoid walking through the Darien Gap, a dangerous jungle in Colombia and Panama. By the spring of 2022, Cubans eclipsed all nationalities but Mexicans in illegal crossings.",
      "\u201cCBP One came like a gift from God,\u201d said Yoandis Delgado, who flew to Nicaragua in 2023, paid a smuggler $1,000 to reach southern Mexico and was repeatedly robbed by Mexican authorities while trying to reach the U.S. border. \u201cCBP One gave us a sense of possibility, of hope.\u201d",
      "Delgado, a cook in Cuba, said Rosales' home and neighborhood don't stand out for people seeking to prey on migrants, giving a sense of security he wouldn't get at hotels or other shelters.",
      "\u201cShe lives in the same condition that we do, not any better,\u201d Delgado said after a pancake breakfast. \u201cShe cries for everything that happens to us, for what we have suffered to get here from Cuba.\u201d",
      "Biden administration officials portray CBP One as a key success in its strategy to create legal pathways at the border while deterring illegal crossings. They note people in life-threatening circumstances can come to a border crossing without an appointment to plead their case.",
      "Anxiety is spreading among migrants in Mexico who fear Trump will end CBP One. Even those in the U.S. are uneasy because parole expires after two years.",
      "The Trump transition team didn't respond to a question about CBP One's future, but his allies say it's overly generous and encourages immigration. A bill that stalled in the Senate in 2023 would have prohibited using the app to admit migrants.",
      "Figueredo, the nurse who helped Rosales, plans to get a green card under a 1966 law that applies to Cubans. She says she and her partner, a barber, came to \u201ccontinue to grow professionally and support our future children.\u201d",
      "She writes Rosales often, telling her that her job is \u201ccrazy\u201d busy and asking about her health. \u201cI hope you\u2019re very happy,\u201d she wrote.",

      "DEERFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions in the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids, according to a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",
      "Walgreens, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 locations, said in a statement that it stands behind its pharmacists. It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A fire at one of the world\u2019s largest battery plants in Northern California contained tens of thousands of lithium batteries that store power from renewable energy and have become a growing electricity source.",
      "By a long shot, California and Texas are opening more large-scale battery projects than anywhere else in the U.S., bolstering power reliability in two large states where extreme weather fueled by climate change has led to electricity shortages and blackouts.",
      "The fire that started Thursday at the Vistra Energy battery plant in Moss Landing, roughly 80 miles (about 130 kilometers) south of San Francisco, led to 1,700 people evacuating, closed part of Highway 1 and generated huge flames and significant amounts of smoke. The cause is under investigation.",
      "Experts say lithium batteries are a safe technology essential for lowering carbon emissions and making grids more reliable. Still, residents near the fire expressed concerns about the impact.",
      "In Texas, which is bracing for another blast of Artic winter weather next week, officials have credited batteries with helping stabilize the state\u2019s independent grid, which was pushed to the brink of collapse during a deadly winter storm in 2021.",

      "Batteries soak up excess wind and solar energy for later use. That backup supply helps the grid during times of high demand, such as during a heat wave, when air conditioning use is heavy.",
      "The cost of lithium batteries has dropped dramatically, boosting their popularity. For electric vehicle lithium batteries, as an example, prices fell by about 90% between 2008 to 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Vehicle Technologies Office.",
      "Cheaper lithium has made utility-scale batteries more cost-competitive than some natural gas alternatives. Batteries can also be switched on and discharge power in a matter of seconds.",
      "The Texas grid is rapidly gaining utility-scale batteries and added a whopping 5 gigawatts of storage over the last year, helping to keep up with demand and avoid blackouts.",
      "The 2021 blackout and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 have helped drive the expansion. Texas\u2019 deregulatory environment has also allowed wind and solar projects to develop quickly and easily, increasing the demand for batteries.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot less red tape that power plants have to go through in Texas,\u201d said Joshua Rhodes, an energy researcher at The University of Texas at Austin. \u201cTexas generally doesn\u2019t have any regulations that stop development.\u201d",
      "Some experts say the cheaper cost of batteries is fueling their rapid adoption more than anything, however.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much of a story of regulation as it is economic efficiency,\u201d said Jay Turner, professor of environmental science at Wellesley College. \u201cThe price of batteries and renewable generation has fallen so much that batteries and solar and wind, when put together, are so cost-competitive.\u201d",
      "The state has long pursued sustainable energy and in 2002 created a set of clean energy standards that the International Energy Agency considers one of the most ambitious in the nation.",
      "As solar and wind became increasingly popular, there were concerns that it would be extremely challenging to integrate that energy into the grid because of their intermittent nature.",
      "\u201cEven back in 2005, it was like any more than 15% renewables on the grid would be impossible,\u201d said Sally Benson, professor of energy science engineering at Stanford University. Last year California had more than 11 gigawatts of utility-scale storage on the grid.",
      "Part of California\u2019s motivation to act stems from electricity shortages. In 2020 the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) ordered rotating outages because the grid was overwhelmed with demand during a heat wave.",
      "Since then several gigawatts of battery storage has been added, a major reason CAISO hasn\u2019t ordered rotating outages in nearly four years, according to Denise Grab, an energy policy researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.",

      "With President-elect Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple",
      "With President-elect Donald Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple that are expected to take the popular video sharing app off their platforms in just two days.",
      "Though the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a federal law that could ban TikTok nationwide, it\u2019s unclear how a shutdown of the popular social media platform will play out and what Americans will see when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday.",
      "The court decision comes against a backdrop of unusual political agitation by Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution after he takes office, and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it won\u2019t enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Now, tech observers \u2014 and some users \u2014 are intently watching to see what happens over the weekend and beyond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really in uncharted territory here in terms of tech policy,\u201d said Sarak Kreps, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "Under the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.",
      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday. Experts have noted TikTok\u2019s app should remain available for current users, but existing ones will no longer be able to update it, making it unusable in the long term.",
      "Trump\u2019s national security adviser has signaled this week that the incoming administration may take steps to \u201ckeep TikTok from going dark,\u201d though what that looks like \u2014 and if any of those steps can withhold legal scrutiny \u2014 remains unclear.",
      "\u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not-too-distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,\u201d Trump said Friday in a post on Truth Social after the court\u2019s ruling. Earlier in the day, he said in another post that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "In the meantime, some of the attention has turned to tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Oracle, who currently offer TikTok on their app stores or host company data on their servers.",
      "Tech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.",
      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",
      "Apple, Google and Oracle did not respond to questions sent this week about their plans on TikTok.",
      "In a video after the court ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais, thanked the president-elect for \u201chis commitment to work\u201d with TikTok to \u201cfind a solution\u201d that keeps the platform available.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform \u2014 one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\u201d Chew said.",
      "Earlier this week, TikTok told its U.S. employees that its offices would remain open for work even if the \u201csituation\u201d won\u2019t be resolved by Sunday. In the memo, which was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by the company, TikTok told workers that their \u201cemployment, pay and benefits\u201d were secure, adding that the law was written in a way that impacts the U.S. user experience, not the entities that employ them.",
      "Meanwhile, in a letter sent Friday to Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, an attorney for TikTok creators who sued the government asked the administration to pause enforcement of the law \u201cuntil there is further definitive guidance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn addition, we request that you clarify that no app store, internet hosting service, or other provider faces any risk of enforcement or penalties with respect to TikTok, CapCut, or any other ByteDance apps, until such further guidance has been issued,\u201d said the letter by attorney Jeffrey Fisher."

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation's highest court upholding a law that's set to halt new downloads of the app starting Sunday. But many questions around what exactly this ban will look like, and whether it will actually be enforced, remain.",
      "That puts millions of users and content creators in limbo \u2014 particularly influencers and small business owners who have come to rely on the mega-popular social media platform as a source of income.",
      "Among those individuals is Terrell Wade, a comedian, actor and content creator with 1.5 million followers on TikTok under the handle @TheWadeEmpire. Wade, who has turned his TikTok presence into a full-time job, said he expects \u201ctwo days of chaos\u201d as the Sunday deadline nears.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d Wade told The Associated Press.",
      "In a unanimous decision on Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that will ban TikTok unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company before Jan. 19 \u2014 ruling that a risk to national security posed by the platform's ties to China overcomes First Amendment concerns about limiting free speech on and by the app.",
      "A sale does not appear imminent, meaning the ban should go into effect Sunday. But the ruling also arrives just days before the inauguration of a new president.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration has maintained that TikTok must change its ownership to address national security concerns, but signaled that it won't enforce the law on Sunday, the Democrat's final full day in office. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that actions to enforce the law will fall to the new administration due to \u201cthe sheer fact of timing.\" Meanwhile, Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who once also tried to ban TikTok, has now vowed to preserve access to the platform. But what his options will be following Monday's inauguration remains unclear.",
      "Among other points of confusion is what a ban on TikTok will look like. Experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users\u2019 devices once the law takes effect. But new users won\u2019t be able to download it and updates will not be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department said in court filings.",
      "All of this is \u201ca reminder to the creator community that social media platforms can come and go,\u201d notes Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester, stressing the disruptions TikTok creators and influencers will feel if the ban takes effect. If access is lost, she adds, many will have to pivot and re-build their presence on other platforms.",
      "While bracing for a potential Sunday ban, Wade is among creators who hope that something happens to avert the shutdown, although he thinks he has enough followers on other platforms to stay afloat.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still remaining optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Still, many continue to express fears over the potential of losing TikTok.",
      "Janette Ok, a full-time content creator based in Los Angeles, says TikTok is the primary platform she uses today. As an influencer and also an artist, she says the platform has helped her make brand deals and promote her music \u2014 bringing \u201copportunities that I never believed I could experience in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "Ok was also among influencers who TikTok brought to Washington in 2023 to lobby for the preservation of the app, and remembers a ban being discussed as far back as 2020. And as someone who is Asian, the efforts to ban TikTok over the years have also felt \u201ca little xenophobic,\u201d she added.",

      "But crypto has so far defied naysayers and survived multiple prolonged price drops in its short lifespan. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last November\u2019s election. Bitcoin has surged in price since Trump's victory, topping $100,000 for the first time last month before briefly sliding down to about $90,000 earlier this week.

The draft order calls for the Treasury Department to eventually hold at least $21 billion in bitcoin.",

      "She brokered a 2023 deal to stop the government from defaulting on its debt. She worked to keep the government from shutting down, preserve disaster relief and address a baby formula shortage. She helped save aid to Ukraine with a loan based on frozen Russian assets.",
      "Young may have been the most powerful low-profile person in the Biden administration. And while President Joe Biden leaves office with a dismal approval rating and a mixed legacy, she departs as the director of the Office of Management and Budget with a record with more wins than losses.",
      "Her formula for success: a blend of understanding the arcana of federal spending, reading the politics of the moment, and convincing reluctant lawmakers that compromise was in their interest.",
      "\u201cShe was an enormous challenge to negotiate with because of her skills, her intelligence and her wicked sense of humor,\u201d said former Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry. \u201cI mean that as the highest of compliments.\u201d",
      "Sitting on a couch in her high-ceilinged office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Young attributed her success to \"giving Republicans who want to do the right thing the political space to do that.\u201d",
      "Now, the incoming Trump administration will face some of the same vexing issues: raising the debt limit, preparing a budget and figuring out how to extend roughly $4 trillion in tax cuts set to expire after this year while also taming a budget deficit expected to be $1.9 trillion.",
      "Trump has nominated his previous budget director Russell Vought to return to the post. With Republicans controlling the House and Senate, Vought won't necessarily need Young's nimble political skills. At his confirmation hearing Wednesday, he declined to say whether he would allow the remaining Ukraine aid to be spent in accordance with Congress' wishes.",
      "For their part, Democrats will no longer have Young as a deal broker. At 47, Young, whose judgment was honed by nearly 15 years as a House Appropriations Committee staffer, feels no need to sugarcoat the hard math.",
      "She figured out how to balance conflicting issues caused by the mix of challenging numbers and toxic partisanship. She also did it while juggling the challenge of being a single parent to her daughter, Charlie, 3 \u2014 meaning that her evening phone calls with lawmakers, cabinet officials and others often had the soundtrack of cooing and crying.",
      "\u201cTo talk to me is to know I have a child,\" Young said.",
      "She had decided to undergo in vitro fertilization treatments, believing that a woman could take the most high-powered of government jobs as well as handle the demanding work of parenthood.",
      "It meant a messy existence of little sleep, high-pressure phone calls and only four weeks of maternity leave.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a choice. I wanted the job and I wanted to at least have a shot at being a parent, and both had a high likelihood of failure,\u201d Young said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I chose chaos.\u201d",
      "The process of parenthood also changed her. She wondered how parents with fewer resources could make it, and concluded that people working 40 hours a week ought to be able to afford decent child care and health care.",
      "Young sees much of her approach stemming from how she grew up in Clinton, Louisiana, where her grandmother came out of retirement to be her middle school basketball coach. She stressed to her that she needed to live as a role model would: \"You don\u2019t know what young girl is watching you. So you are always to be on your best behavior. Be a leader of this team.\"",
      "That guided how she drives a deal. She let lawmakers, colleagues and even the president be human. When she negotiated on Ukraine funding, she thought about visiting that country as a congressional staffer and her trip to a child center there, where she played with the kids.",
      "When negotiations were faltering in 2023 to raise the debt ceiling, she worried about a growing number of Republicans who seemed to view default as an acceptable risk. But she says there is still enough of a governing majority who understood the threat to the nation and their constituents.",
      "The talks had become a circus on Capitol Hill, with reporters chasing the negotiators, so she moved negotiations to the Office of Management and Budget conference room with its relative privacy on the White House campus. She said she needed to get the right Republicans, such as McHenry, in the room.",
      "After agreeing on top-line numbers, Republicans said they needed to be able to go to their fellow lawmakers with work requirements on people who receive food aid. Young agreed to their terms, knowing some would lose benefits.",
      "To ultimately settle the deal, Young needed to bring Biden back from a foreign trip in Asia. At their final meeting on a May Friday, Young felt confident she had a deal. But she needed to fly to New Orleans to deliver a commencement speech at Xavier University. Her final phone calls ended at 3 a.m. and she then spent Saturday morning on the phone with Biden going over the deal.",
      "\u201cI'm glad I went,\u201d she said of the speech, but then added with laughter, \u201cThat weekend almost killed me.\u201d",
      "For her part, Young admitted she was most nervous to present the deal to Democratic lawmakers, scared that they might tear her head off for the resulting compromise.",
      "Instead, she got a standing ovation from the room.",
      "\u201cI cried like a baby,\u201d she said.",
      "Young has a position lined up for life after the White House, but it hasn't been announced yet. She said she's looking forward to the idea of living with just one cellphone."

But he dropped the plan amid accusations he would violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution that bans presidents from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments.",
      "The golf courses may also attract foreign officials and special interest groups hoping to gain access and curry favor by spending large sums at Trump properties.",
      "Since the start of Trump\u2019s first term in office, the cost to join his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, has soared to $1 million, allowing wealthy people to mix pleasure with politics and government business during his frequent visits to the club.",
      "While Trump collects income from Mar-a-Lago \u2014 $111 million over the last two years \u2014 he\u2019s been accused of charging the U.S. Secret Service \u201cexorbitant\u201d room rates of more than $800 per night for agents assigned to protect him when he traveled there and to other Trump family properties.",
      "Who Trump meets with while at Mar-a-Lago and what he discusses are largely hidden from public view. The Secret Service has no electronic systems to screen or monitor presidential visitors to the estate, according to a 2020 federal appeals court ruling.",
      "Trump launched his social media platform, Truth Social, in early 2022, after he was banned from major sites such as Facebook and the platform formerly known as Twitter following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "While he\u2019s since been reinstated to both, Trump has often used Truth Social for more personal commentary, leaving traffic on X and other platforms for more formal statements and pronouncements. The company hasn\u2019t disclosed how many users it has, so it\u2019s hard to know how broad Trump\u2019s reach there is.",
      "But what is clear is that Trump is the primary player in Trump Media & Technology Group, which started trading on the NASDAQ stock market in March. The incoming president has a majority stake in the company, and said shortly after his general election win that he had \u201cNO INTENTION OF SELLING\u201d his shares, which have significantly boosted Trump\u2019s net worth, and at that time were valued at around $3.5 billion.",
      "Trump has promised to make America the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d as he returns to the White House, a promise that would likely pay off for him personally.",
      "Amidst the 2024 campaign, Trump launched a new venture to trade cryptocurrencies that he has promoted on the same social media accounts he used for his campaign. His two eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have also posted about their new platform, called World Liberty Financial, as has his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who is married to Eric and also serves as co-chair of the Republican National Committee.",
      "The new moneymaking venture could explode in value if Trump pushes through legislative and regulatory changes long sought by crypto advocates.",
      "During his first term, Trump said he was \u201cnot a fan\u201d of cryptocurrency but he has since taken a more favorable view \u2014 from announcing in May that the campaign would begin accepting donations in cryptocurrency to attending a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, promising to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a Bitcoin \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d using the currency that the government currently holds.",
      "Several of Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees, including Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick and Trump\u2019s pick for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Paul Atkins, have substantial cryptocurrency investments.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China's population fell last year for the third straight year, its government said Friday, pointing to further demographic challenges for the world's second most populous nation, which is now facing both an aging population and an emerging shortage of working age people.",
      "China's population stood at 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year.",
      "The figures announced by the government in Beijing follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea and other nations have seen their birth rates plummet. China three years ago joined Japan and most of Eastern Europe among other nations whose population is falling.",
      "The reasons are in many cases similar: Rising costs of living are causing young people to put off or rule out marriage and child birth while pursuing higher education and careers. While people are living longer, that's not enough to keep up with rate of new births.",
      "Countries such as China that allow very little immigration are especially at risk.",
      "China has long been among the world\u2019s most populous nations, enduring invasions, floods and other natural disasters to sustain a population that thrived on rice in the south and wheat in the north. Following the end of World War II and the Communist Party\u2019s rise to power in 1949, large families re-emerged and the population doubled in just three decades, even after tens of millions died in the Great Leap Forward that sought to revolutionize agriculture and industry and the Cultural Revolution that followed a few years later.",
      "After the end of the Cultural Revolution and leader Mao Zedong's death, Communist bureaucrats began to worry the country\u2019s population was outstripping its ability to feed itself and began implementing a draconian \u201cone child policy.\u201d Though it was never law, women had to apply for permission to have a child and violators could face forced late-term abortions and birth control procedures, massive fines and the prospect of their child being deprived an identification number, effectively making them non-citizens.",
      "Rural China, where the preference for male offspring was especially strong and two children were still ostensibly allowed, became the focus of government efforts, with women forced to present evidence they were menstruating and buildings emblazoned with slogans such as \u201chave fewer children, have better children.\"",
      "The government sought to stamp out selective abortion of female children, but with abortions legal and readily available, those operating illicit sonogram machines enjoyed a thriving business.",
      "That has been the biggest factor in China\u2019s lopsided sex ratio, with as many as millions more boys born for every 100 girls, raising the possibility of social instability among China\u2019s army of bachelors. Friday\u2019s report gave the sex imbalance as 104.34 men to every 100 women, though independent groups give the imbalance as considerably higher.",
      "More disturbing for the government was the drastically falling birthrate, with China\u2019s total population dropping for the first time in decades in 2023 and China being narrowly overtaken by India as the world\u2019s most populous nation in the same year. A rapidly aging population, declining workforce, lack of consumer markets and migration abroad are putting the system under severe pressure.",
      "While spending on the military and flashy infrastructure projects continues to rise, China\u2019s already frail social security system is teetering, with increasing numbers of Chinese refusing to pay into the underfunded pension system.",
      "Already, more than one-fifth of the population is aged 60 or over, with the official figure given as 310.3 million or 22% of the total population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 30%, sparking discussion of changes to the official retirement age, which one of the lowest in the world. With fewer students, some vacant schools and kindergartens are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Such developments are giving some credence to the aphorism that China, now the world\u2019s second largest economy but facing major headwinds, will \u201cgrow old before it grows rich.\u201d",
      "Government inducements including cash payouts for having up to three children and financial help with housing costs have had only temporary effects.",
      "Meanwhile, China continued its transition to an urban society, with 10 million more people moving to cities for an urbanization rate of 67%, up almost a percentage point from the previous year.",

      "Exports have surged as companies and consumers rush to beat potential tariff hikes President-elect Donald Trump may impose on Chinese goods.",
      "\u201cThe national economy was generally stable with steady progress and new achievements were made in high-quality development,\u201d the report by the National Bureau of Statistics said. \"Particularly, with a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out, public confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,\u201d it said.",
      "Manufacturing was a strong engine for growth last year, with industrial output jumping 5.8% from a year earlier. Total retail sales of consumer goods grew 3.5% at an annual rate. Exports expanded 7.1% in annual terms, while imports grew 2.3%.",
      "The world\u2019s second largest economy has struggled with weaker consumer spending and resulting deflationary pressures as its recovery after the COVID 19 pandemic faltered and the property sector, once a main driver of business activity, fell into a downturn.",

      "Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said that the economy regained some momentum last quarter thanks to recent policy easing.",
      "\u201cIncreased fiscal spending should continue to provide a near-term prop to activity,\u201d Huang said in a report. \u201cWe still expect growth to slow for 2025 as a whole, with Trump likely to follow through on his tariff threats soon and persistent structural imbalances still weighing on the economy.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s population also is aging and declining, adding to pressures on growth. The government reported Friday that the population fell for a third straight year in 2024, to 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year.",
      "With costs of living rising faster than wages, young Chinese are putting off or ruling out marriage and childbirth, accentuating the impact of birth control policies that once limited most families to one child each.",
      "Some economists say the economy is growing at a slower pace than shown in official estimates.",
      "\u201cThe precise achievement of the official growth target is highly dubious at a time when most indicators of economic activity and financial markets are flashing red,\u201d Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, said in an emailed comment.",
      "\u201cThe economy continues to be beset by a combination of weak domestic demand and persistent deflationary pressures, in addition to a hostile external environment that could limit exports,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump, who will be inaugurated next week, has pledged to increase U.S. import duties on Chinese goods. This week, the Biden administration also imposed further restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductors and technology, seeking to maintain the U.S. lead on advanced technologies and block China\u2019s access.",
      "The ruling Communist Party has rolled out a series of stimulus measures, including reducing banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratios, cutting interest rates and frontloading billions from its budget in 2025 to fund construction projects. It has ordered banks to lend to beleaguered property developers that were left mired in debt after authorities cracked down on excess borrowing.",
      "National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson Fu Linghui told reporters in Beijing that boosting consumption and expanding domestic demand are priorities this year.",
      "\u201cWith the coordinated efforts of stock policies and a package of incremental policies, the momentum of economic recovery is strengthening, the recovery of consumer demand has accelerated, and there are more favorable factors for a moderate rebound in prices,\u201d he said.",
      "Beijing has expanded a trade-in scheme for consumer goods and raised the wages of millions of government workers to revive domestic demand.",
      "Those incremental moves need to be accompanied by broader structural reforms, some economists say, that will improve productivity and make the economy less reliant on construction and export manufacturing. In particular, private businesses remain wary of boosting investment or hiring after years of policy shifts that have added to uncertainty over their role in the economy.",
      "Scant social safety nets, meanwhile, lead families to save rather than spend, and falling housing prices and weak stock prices have hurt household wealth, compounding the problem.",
      "\u201cChina needs a strong and multi-pronged policy package to revive growth momentum,\u201d Prasad said. Such a package would need to include substantial and well-targeted monetary and fiscal stimulus, complemented by reforms and other measures to revive private sector confidence.\""

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \u201cstamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\u201d while putting the new administration on notice.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to keep an eye on whether this administration decides to make a total U-turn and say, it\u2019s okay for children to be exploited in these dangerous industries and get injured and die and have their futures robbed,\u201d said Berkowitz, who is now a fellow at George Washington University focused on labor issues.",
      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",
      "That PSSI case got started after one 13-year-old suffered a serious chemical burn from the caustic chemicals used to clean the JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, every night. But then investigators found more and more examples of PSSI employing children.",
      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor is determined to stop our nation\u2019s children from being endangered in jobs for which they should never be hired and to leverage our enforcement work to affect industries,\u201d said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service LLC, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota,",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \u201cQSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\u201d he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\u201d",
      "Perdue was employing children at a Virginia plant using dangerous knives and other tools to slaughter chicken.",
      "The JBS agreement didn't include a finding that children were working directly for that company, but there have been examples at its plants.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor has made clear that too often, companies look the other way and claim that their staffing agency, or their subcontractor or supplier is responsible. But everyone has a responsibility to keep children \u2014 our most vulnerable workers \u2014 safe,\u201d the Department said.",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",
      "That includes steps like training all managers about how to spot underage applicants and avoid hiring them. False identification documents continue to be a problem. Companies are also expected to require all of their subcontractors to take precautions.",
      "Companies are also expected to set up hotlines where people can report any child labor concerns. And the Labor Department expects them to maintain accurate records of all their employees including their birth dates and work they do.",
      "And companies should discipline anyone who does hire children in violation of labor laws."

      "The uptick in the cost of home loans reflects a rise in the bond yields that lenders use as a guide to price mortgages, specifically the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has climbed from 3.62% in mid-September to 4.61% as of midday Thursday.",
      "The elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have discouraged home shoppers, prolonging a national home sales slump that began in 2022.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage is now the highest it\u2019s been since May 9, when it was at 7.09%.",
      "Interest rates have been climbing since the Federal Reserve signaled last month that it expected to lower its benchmark rate just twice this year, down from the four cuts it forecast in September.",
      "The Fed is tapping the brakes on rate cuts because inflation remains stubbornly above the central bank\u2019s 2% target, even though it\u2019s fallen from its mid-2022 peak. Economists also worry that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies, notably his plan to vastly increase tariffs on imports, could fuel inflation.",
      "Forecasting the trajectory of mortgage rates is difficult, given that rates are influenced by many factors, from government spending and the economy, to geopolitical tensions and stock and bond market gyrations.",
      "Several economists' forecasts call for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% this year, with some including an upper range as high as 6.8%.",

      "U.S. defense contractor Anduril Industries is preparing to build a massive advanced manufacturing facility in central Ohio",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- U.S. defense contractor Anduril Industries is preparing to build a massive advanced manufacturing facility in central Ohio, adding a planned 4,000 jobs to the area's burgeoning high-tech sector, state officials announced Thursday.",
      "The Cosa Mesa, California-based defense technology company plans to begin construction of what it's calling \u201cArsenal 1\u201d as soon as state and local approvals are secured. The 5 million-square-foot (464,515-square-meter) facility will be located on a 500-acre (202-hectare) site near Rickenbacker International Airport in rural Pickaway County, about 16 miles (26 kilometers) southeast of Columbus.",
      "Production of military drones and autonomous air vehicles would begin in July 2026 under the plan, said Christian Brose, Anduril's chief strategy officer.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said it is the largest single job creation and payroll project that Ohio has announced. The governor said winning Anduril's manufacturing plant marks a continuation of Ohio's history of advanced advanced aviation, which began with the Wright brothers and continues to grow surrounding the Dayton-area Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.",
      "\u201cWe are an aerospace state,\u201d DeWine said. He called Ohio \u201cthe brains of the Air Force.\u201d",
      "DeWine, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and JobsOhio CEO J.P. Nauseef said that, through targeted economic development efforts, the state boasts a strong and diverse aerospace workforce. They said it also has a network of job training centers, colleges and universities prepared to educate new advanced manufacturing workers. Those helped attract the nationally-competitive deal, they said.",
      "\u201cOhio has literally built a strategy around this kind of project, and so we are perfect for them,\" Husted said.",
      "The aerospace sector in Ohio includes the global headquarters of GE Aerospace and a new Joby Aviation manufacturing facility near Dayton that's preparing to manufacture electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft beginning this year.",
      "Anduril casts the Ohio facility as integral to its goal to \u201cRebuild the Arsenal\u201d of U.S. military weapons and platforms by \u201chyperscaling\u201d manufacturing with advanced software and production technologies.",
      "The latest development adds to what is becoming known as a \u201csilicon corridor\u201d based in Ohio. It includes Intel, which is building a $20 billion chip factory just east of the Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea, which are building a $3.5 billion battery plant in nearby Fayette County that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub. Ohio State University also announced plans in 2023 to build a $110 million software innovation center to dovetail with those efforts.",
      "At separate upcoming state meetings, the Anduril project will pursue a job creation tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $70 million infusion from the All Ohio Future Fund, which the DeWine administration and lawmakers established to help local governments prepare sites for economic development projects. JobsOhio also plans to provide the project a sizeable grant, whose exact amount will be announced once agreements are signed, as well as talent acquisition services.",

      "Americans stepped up their spending at retail stores and restaurants last month in a clear sign that consumers are still able and willing to shop.",
      "Retail sales rose 0.4% in December from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Thursday, though down from November's upwardly revised 0.8% gain.",
      "The figures suggest that even as many Americans are struggling with higher prices and elevated interest rates, a low unemployment rate and rising wages are encouraging millions of consumers to spend, bolstering economic growth. Last Friday the government reported that employers stepped up hiring in December and the unemployment rate fell to a low 4.1%.",
      "Much of last month's increase in spending was driven by a 0.7% jump in car sales, and a 2.3% spike in purchases of furniture. The report isn't adjusted for price increases, though the sales gains mostly reflects greater buying.",
      "After dropping precipitously in 2023, inflation has been stuck at about 2.7% in recent months, and prices are still much higher than four years ago. Still, on Wednesday the Labor Department said that core prices \u2014 excluding the volatile food and energy categories \u2014 rose more slowly last month, as clothing prices barely increases and apartment rental costs climbed at a slower pace.",
      "The cooler core inflation figures renewed hopes among economists and Wall Street investors that the Federal Reserve will cut its key rate further this year, after three reductions last year reduced by a percentage point to about 4.3%.",

      "LONDON -- U.K.-based oil company BP is cutting 4,700 jobs worldwide and a further 3,000 contractor roles as part of a cost-saving drive.",
      "In an email to staff on Thursday that has been seen by The Associated Press, CEO Murray Auchincloss said the job losses \u201caccount for much of the anticipated reduction this year.\"",
      "The reductions amount to just over 5% of BP's 90,000 worldwide employees. Auchincloss\u2019s memo said that about 2,600 of the contractors involved in the job cuts have already left the business.",
      "Last October, the company said it had identified $500 million of cost savings to be delivered this year, a quarter of the $2 billion-target set in April by the end of 2026.",
      "Auchincloss said that the company is \u201cfocusing resources on our highest-value opportunities\u201d and that it has stopped or paused 30 projects since June.",
      "The reductions come as BP tries to bring more digital capabilities into the business, with artificial intelligence increasingly playing a role in engineering and marketing operations.",
      "In April, Auchincloss announced a plan to make savings of $2 billion (1.6 billion pounds) by the end of 2026.",
      "The plan is designed partly to reinvigorate the company\u2019s flagging share price, which has fallen about 20% since last spring.",
      "BP also has pulled back from a number of renewable energy projects, and according to media reports, abandoned a previous plan to cut oil and gas output by 40% by 2030.",
      "Auchincloss, however, said that the company was still \u201cuniquely positioned to grow value through the energy transition,\u201d but that it needed \u201cto keep improving our competitiveness and moving at the pace of our customers and society.\u201d",
      "It comes days after BP delayed an investor event due to be held in New York to allow the CEO to recover after a medical procedure. Its scheduled capital markets event that was due on Feb. 11 has been postponed until Feb. 26 and will take place in London \u201cto ensure his full recuperation.\""

      "The final jobs report of 2024 underscores that the economy and hiring were able to grow at a solid pace even with interest rates much higher than they were before the pandemic. As a result, the Federal Reserve could be much less likely to cut borrowing costs again in the coming months after issuing three cuts late in 2024.",

It\u2019s been part of my game as long as I can remember.",

Don\u2019t just do it; if you\u2019re going to do it, at least try to do something with it.\u2019 It\u2019s really exciting right now.\u201d",

I know he\u2019s probably shooting it.\u2019 So, I kind of just stood there and watched the rest of however many seconds it was. You see him take off for the bench and everyone just mauled him.

      "CHICAGO -- Sammy Sosa jogged onto the stage, carrying an American flag. The crowd cheered wildly.",
      "It was just like old times \u2014 only Sosa was dressed in a suit, and the scene occurred in a downtown hotel ballroom instead of Wrigley Field.",
      "Sosa and the Chicago Cubs are back together after the slugger returned to the team's annual fan convention on Friday. The Cubs also announced that Sosa will be inducted into the franchise's Hall of Fame this year, alongside former first baseman Derrek Lee.",
      "The reconciliation began when Sosa released a vaguely worded statement last month apologizing for unspecified mistakes. Sosa has faced questions about using performance-enhancing drugs, but he said that wasn't the reason for his statement.",
      "\u201cNo. I'm referring, for example, look, 21 years out,\u201d said Sosa, who played his last season with the Cubs in 2004. \u201cI had the fans that loved me very much. I had to apologize to them because I mean normally they see me play so many years.\u201d",
      "While Sosa, 56, declined to offer any specifics about his apology, it didn't look as if that mattered at all to Cubs fans \u2014 who had clamored for a reunion for years \u2014 or the organization, which put together a warm welcome after ignoring the seven-time All-Star for decades.",
      "There was a standing ovation when Sosa was announced as part of the team's Hall of Fame class, and the cheers picked up when he appeared on stage holding the flag \u2014 reminiscent of how he ran out to right field in the Cubs' first home game after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.",

      "\u201cI think that today was a perfect day,\u201d Sosa said.",
      "Sosa rose to prominence with the Cubs after he was acquired in a March 1992 trade with the crosstown White Sox for George Bell. Nicknamed Slammin' Sammy, he hit a franchise-record 545 homers and drove in 1,414 runs in 13 years on the North Side.",
      "Sosa became a national figure when he staged a memorable home run duel with Mark McGwire during the 1998 season. Sosa went deep 66 times and won the NL MVP award, and McGwire finished with 70 homers \u2014 breaking baseball's single-season record at the time.",

So it\u2019s good that he\u2019s back. It\u2019s great that he\u2019s here.\u201d",

      "Santa Clara County's Superior Court Judge Hector Ramon said he couldn't grant bail or release the former football star because the case remains under the jurisdiction of an appeals court, The Mercury News reported.",
      "The Sixth District Court of Appeal vacated Stubblefield's conviction in December 2024 and overturned his sentence of 15 years to life in prison after finding that racial bias had tainted the Black man's trial. But the appellate court's remittitur, a technical ruling that returns jurisdiction to the lower court, is not expected to be issued until next month, the news outlet reported.",
      "Stubblefield's attorneys have sought his release, asserting there are no longer grounds to keep him incarcerated.",

That would effectively return Stubblefield to the same status that he had pretrial, which they argue is his current legal standing, the news outlet reported.",
      "In court Friday, Ramon maintained jurisdiction isn't returned to the local court until the Court of Appeal issues the remittitur. Deputy District Attorney Tim McInerney's office has stated it supports Stubblefield remaining in custody, according to The Mercury News.",

      "The retired football player was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison in October 2020 after being convicted of raping a developmentally disabled woman whom prosecutors said he lured to his home in 2015 with the promise of a babysitting job. Defense attorneys said no rape occurred, and Stubblefield said the woman consented to sex in exchange for money.",
      "In December 2024, the Sixth Court of Appeal found that prosecutors violated the California Racial Justice Act of 2020, a law passed during a summer of protest over the police killing of George Floyd. The measure bars prosecutors from seeking a criminal conviction or imposing a sentence on the basis of race.",
      "The appeals court said prosecutors used \u201cracially discriminatory language\u201d that required them to overturn Stubblefield\u2019s conviction.",
      "Stubblefield began his 11-year lineman career in the NFL with the 49ers in 1993 as the league\u2019s defensive rookie of the year. He later won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 1997 before leaving the team to play for Washington. He returned to the Bay Area to finish his career, playing with the 49ers in 2000-01 and the Raiders in 2003."

      "Under the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.",
      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday. Experts have noted TikTok\u2019s app should remain available for current users, but existing ones will no longer be able to update it, making it unusable in the long term.",
      "Trump\u2019s national security adviser has signaled this week that the incoming administration may take steps to \u201ckeep TikTok from going dark,\u201d though what that looks like \u2014 and if any of those steps can withhold legal scrutiny \u2014 remains unclear.",
      "\u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not-too-distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,\u201d Trump said Friday in a post on Truth Social after the court\u2019s ruling. Earlier in the day, he said in another post that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "In the meantime, some of the attention has turned to tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Oracle, who currently offer TikTok on their app stores or host company data on their servers.",
      "Tech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.",
      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",
      "Apple, Google and Oracle did not respond to questions sent this week about their plans on TikTok.",
      "In a video after the court ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais, thanked the president-elect for \u201chis commitment to work\u201d with TikTok to \u201cfind a solution\u201d that keeps the platform available.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform \u2014 one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\u201d Chew said.",
      "Earlier this week, TikTok told its U.S. employees that its offices would remain open for work even if the \u201csituation\u201d won\u2019t be resolved by Sunday. In the memo, which was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by the company, TikTok told workers that their \u201cemployment, pay and benefits\u201d were secure, adding that the law was written in a way that impacts the U.S. user experience, not the entities that employ them.",
      "Meanwhile, in a letter sent Friday to Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, an attorney for TikTok creators who sued the government asked the administration to pause enforcement of the law \u201cuntil there is further definitive guidance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn addition, we request that you clarify that no app store, internet hosting service, or other provider faces any risk of enforcement or penalties with respect to TikTok, CapCut, or any other ByteDance apps, until such further guidance has been issued,\u201d said the letter by attorney Jeffrey Fisher."

      "Some of the \u201cTikTok refugees,\u201d as they call themselves, say the TikTok alternative, a Chinese app, is being chosen in protest of the TikTok ban. Here's what you need to know about Xiaohongshu.",
      "It is a lifestyle social media app which allows users to post short videos, photos and texts, and it also includes functions like live-streaming and shopping.",
      "A rare wave of U.S.-China camaraderie broke out online in recent days as \u201crefugees\u201d from the popular short video platform TikTok poured onto a Chinese social media platform to protest a likely ban on the service.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation's highest court upholding a law that's set to halt new downloads of the app starting Sunday. But many questions around what exactly this ban will look like, and whether it will actually be enforced, remain.",
      "That puts millions of users and content creators in limbo \u2014 particularly influencers and small business owners who have come to rely on the mega-popular social media platform as a source of income.",
      "Among those individuals is Terrell Wade, a comedian, actor and content creator with 1.5 million followers on TikTok under the handle @TheWadeEmpire. Wade, who has turned his TikTok presence into a full-time job, said he expects \u201ctwo days of chaos\u201d as the Sunday deadline nears.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d Wade told The Associated Press.",
      "In a unanimous decision on Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that will ban TikTok unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company before Jan. 19 \u2014 ruling that a risk to national security posed by the platform's ties to China overcomes First Amendment concerns about limiting free speech on and by the app.",
      "A sale does not appear imminent, meaning the ban should go into effect Sunday. But the ruling also arrives just days before the inauguration of a new president.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration has maintained that TikTok must change its ownership to address national security concerns, but signaled that it won't enforce the law on Sunday, the Democrat's final full day in office. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that actions to enforce the law will fall to the new administration due to \u201cthe sheer fact of timing.\" Meanwhile, Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who once also tried to ban TikTok, has now vowed to preserve access to the platform. But what his options will be following Monday's inauguration remains unclear.",
      "Among other points of confusion is what a ban on TikTok will look like. Experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users\u2019 devices once the law takes effect. But new users won\u2019t be able to download it and updates will not be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department said in court filings.",
      "All of this is \u201ca reminder to the creator community that social media platforms can come and go,\u201d notes Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester, stressing the disruptions TikTok creators and influencers will feel if the ban takes effect. If access is lost, she adds, many will have to pivot and re-build their presence on other platforms.",
      "While bracing for a potential Sunday ban, Wade is among creators who hope that something happens to avert the shutdown, although he thinks he has enough followers on other platforms to stay afloat.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still remaining optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Still, many continue to express fears over the potential of losing TikTok.",
      "Janette Ok, a full-time content creator based in Los Angeles, says TikTok is the primary platform she uses today. As an influencer and also an artist, she says the platform has helped her make brand deals and promote her music \u2014 bringing \u201copportunities that I never believed I could experience in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "Ok was also among influencers who TikTok brought to Washington in 2023 to lobby for the preservation of the app, and remembers a ban being discussed as far back as 2020. And as someone who is Asian, the efforts to ban TikTok over the years have also felt \u201ca little xenophobic,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cI hear all these different things, and I don\u2019t know what to believe \u2014 so that\u2019s where I\u2019m very frustrated. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m disappointed,\" Ok said. \"It\u2019s a beautiful app, it\u2019s brought so many people together, it\u2019s changed a lot of people\u2019s lives, and for it to just be taken away like that feels ... so not American.\u201d",
      "Jordan Smith, a former WNBA player who operates The Elevated Closet in Austin, Texas \u2014 a clothing brand for tall women \u2014 depends on TikTok and TikTok Shop to find customers that fit her niche demographic that\u2019s difficult to specifically market to otherwise.",
      "\u201cOn TikTok I\u2019ve just been able to find that audience so much easier,\u201d she said.",
      "She fears losing TikTok will hurt her business, and she'll miss it personally, too. So she\u2019s following what people are saying will happen on Sunday and hopes a ban might be diverted.",
      "\u201cIt kind of seems like Biden\u2019s kind of pushing it off to Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cSo people have hopes that maybe we have a few more days and it won\u2019t go dark on Sunday, but I don\u2019t really know.\u201d",
      "Alejandro Flores-Munoz owns a catering business in the Denver area called Combi Taco, or @combicafe on TikTok. TikTok helped him reach customers without spending money on marketing, he said. He was optimistic that TikTok would stick around until he heard Friday's Supreme Court decision.",
      "\u201cUp until today, I was extremely optimistic. And after today\u2019s Supreme Court decision to uphold the ban or the sale of TikTok, I weigh my options,\u201d he said. \u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s very disheartening, specifically because I truly did rely on the app for my business and my growth of my business.\u201d",

There are so many applications that require STEM skills. I heard from marketing people who went to school for mechanical engineering, and then ended up getting greater satisfaction from marketing. Or, they still work hand-in-hand. I would really like to get to a point where I can say the same.\u201d",

It took sponsorship from Gainbridge, Konica Minolta and EVERFi, which is working to develop the curriculum to continue the program, to launch it in IMSA.",
      "The students made four stops at the track: Tires, Traction and Tread to learn about physics and engineering at the Michelin Tire Center; Data-Driven Racing at the IMSA Engineering Center to learn about data, science and technology; Engineering Safety at IMSA Tech Inspection Area to learn about material science; and IMSA Technology Lab, with the IMSA GTP Hybrid Electrified Race Car, at Action Express Racing to learn about physics and engineering.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is a laboratory. It\u2019s a laboratory for the automakers. It\u2019s a laboratory for Michelin on the tire front. It\u2019s a laboratory for all these teams,\u201d Doonan said. \"For the students to be able to see what they\u2019re doing in the classroom, be applied in a real-world environment, that gives me and all of my IMSA teammates a lot of satisfaction.",
      "\"These students here, some of the top students from the Volusia County schools surrounding the Daytona area, they\u2019re our future.

      "Disabled people make up about 3% of the science, technology, engineering and math workforce, according to 2021 data from the National Science Foundation.",
      "Scientists with disabilities say that\u2019s in part because labs, classrooms and field sites aren\u2019t designed to accommodate them.

      "Scientists are unraveling the mystery of what triggers Huntington\u2019s disease, a devastating hereditary disorder that strikes in the prime of life",
      "Scientists are unraveling the mystery of what triggers Huntington\u2019s disease, a devastating and fatal hereditary disorder that strikes in the prime of life, causing nerve cells in parts of the brain to break down and die.",
      "The genetic mutation linked to Huntington's has long been known, but scientists haven't understood how people could have the mutation from birth, but not develop any problems until later in life.",
      "New research shows that the mutation is, surprisingly, harmless for decades. But it quietly grows into a larger mutation \u2014 until it eventually crosses a threshold, generates toxic proteins, and kills the cells it has expanded in.",
      "\u201cThe conundrum in our field has been: Why do you have a genetic disorder that manifests later in life if the gene is present at conception?\u201d said Dr. Mark Mehler, who directs the Institute for Brain Disorders and Neural Regeneration at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was not involved in the research. He called the research a \u201clandmark\u201d study and said \"it addresses a lot of the issues that have plagued the field for a long time.\u201d",
      "The brain cell death eventually leads to problems with movement, thinking and behavior. Huntington\u2019s symptoms \u2013 which include involuntary movement, unsteady gait, personality changes and impaired judgment \u2013 typically begin between the ages of 30 and 50, gradually worsening over 10 to 25 years.",
      "Scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and Harvard Medical School studied brain tissue donated by 53 people with Huntington\u2019s and 50 without it, analyzing half a million cells.",
      "They focused on the Huntington\u2019s mutation, which involves a stretch of DNA in a particular gene where a three-letter sequence \u2013 CAG \u2013 is repeated at least 40 times. In people without the disease this sequence is repeated just 15 to 35 times. They discovered that DNA tracts with 40 or more such \u201crepeats\u201d expand over time until they are hundreds of CAGs long. Once CAGs reach a threshold of about 150, certain types of neurons sicken and die.",
      "The findings \u201cwere really surprising, even to us,\u201d said Steve McCarroll, a Broad member and co-senior author of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal Cell. The study was partly funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, an organization that also supports The Associated Press Health and Science department.",
      "The research team estimated that repeat tracts grow slowly during the first two decades of life, then the rate accelerates dramatically when they reach about 80 CAGs.",
      "\u201cThe longer the repeats, the earlier in life the onset will happen,\u201d said neuroscience researcher Sabina Berretta, one of the study's senior authors.",
      "Researchers acknowledged that some scientists were initially skeptical when results were shared at conferences, since previous work found that repeat expansions in the range of 30 to 100 CAGs were necessary \u2014 but not sufficient \u2014 to cause Huntington\u2019s. McCarroll agreed that 100 or fewer CAGs are not sufficient to trigger the disease, but said his study found that expansions with at least 150 CAGs are.",
      "Researchers hope their findings can help scientists come up with ways to delay or prevent the incurable condition, which afflicts about 41,000 Americans and is now treated with medications to manage the symptoms.",
      "Recently, experimental drugs designed to lower levels of the protein produced by the mutated Huntington's gene have struggled in trials. The new findings suggest that's because few cells have the toxic version of the protein at any given time.",
      "Slowing or stopping the expansion of DNA repeats may be a better way to target the disease, researchers said.",
      "Though there are no guarantees this would stave off Huntington\u2019s, McCarroll said \u201cmany companies are starting or expanding programs to try to do this.\u201d",

      "The Cosa Mesa, California-based defense technology company plans to begin construction of what it's calling \u201cArsenal 1\u201d as soon as state and local approvals are secured. The 5 million-square-foot (464,515-square-meter) facility will be located on a 500-acre (202-hectare) site near Rickenbacker International Airport in rural Pickaway County, about 16 miles (26 kilometers) southeast of Columbus.",
      "Production of military drones and autonomous air vehicles would begin in July 2026 under the plan, said Christian Brose, Anduril's chief strategy officer.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said it is the largest single job creation and payroll project that Ohio has announced. The governor said winning Anduril's manufacturing plant marks a continuation of Ohio's history of advanced advanced aviation, which began with the Wright brothers and continues to grow surrounding the Dayton-area Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.",
      "\u201cWe are an aerospace state,\u201d DeWine said. He called Ohio \u201cthe brains of the Air Force.\u201d",
      "DeWine, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and JobsOhio CEO J.P. Nauseef said that, through targeted economic development efforts, the state boasts a strong and diverse aerospace workforce. They said it also has a network of job training centers, colleges and universities prepared to educate new advanced manufacturing workers. Those helped attract the nationally-competitive deal, they said.",
      "\u201cOhio has literally built a strategy around this kind of project, and so we are perfect for them,\" Husted said.",
      "The aerospace sector in Ohio includes the global headquarters of GE Aerospace and a new Joby Aviation manufacturing facility near Dayton that's preparing to manufacture electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft beginning this year.",
      "Anduril casts the Ohio facility as integral to its goal to \u201cRebuild the Arsenal\u201d of U.S. military weapons and platforms by \u201chyperscaling\u201d manufacturing with advanced software and production technologies.",
      "The latest development adds to what is becoming known as a \u201csilicon corridor\u201d based in Ohio. It includes Intel, which is building a $20 billion chip factory just east of the Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea, which are building a $3.5 billion battery plant in nearby Fayette County that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub. Ohio State University also announced plans in 2023 to build a $110 million software innovation center to dovetail with those efforts.",
      "At separate upcoming state meetings, the Anduril project will pursue a job creation tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $70 million infusion from the All Ohio Future Fund, which the DeWine administration and lawmakers established to help local governments prepare sites for economic development projects. JobsOhio also plans to provide the project a sizeable grant, whose exact amount will be announced once agreements are signed, as well as talent acquisition services.",

      "Efforts to ban students' cellphones at school is gaining rare bipartisan consensus in Republican and Democrat-led states",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Arkansas' Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom have little in common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an idea that's been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states: Students' cellphones need to be banned during the school day.",
      "At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years, and proposals are being considered in several more states this year.",
      "Here is a look at the push by states for such bans.",
      "The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the impact screen time has on children\u2019s mental health and complaints from teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the classroom.",
      "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people\u2019s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free times.",
      "Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them.",
      "Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile devices.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,\u201d she said.",
      "At least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools.",
      "The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media on district Wi-Fi.",
      "A 2024 California law requires the state\u2019s nearly 1,000 school districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026.",
      "Several other states haven't banned phones, but have encouraged school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to store phones during the day.",
      "Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 schools signed on. In her state of the state address this week, Sanders proposed an outright ban.",
      "\u201cWe will ban cellphones in our schools, bell to bell, so that our kids are not distracted, in class or out of it,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has suggested she'll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered specifics.",
      "The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of emergency.",
      "Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last time.",
      "But supporters of the bans have noted that students' phones could pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or by revealing their location during an active shooter situation.",
      "Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating transportation.",
      "Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she agrees about the dangers of social media on children but that the bans sought by states are taking too broad of an approach. Banning the devices during the school day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers of social media, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the skills they need to actually navigate this technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe've just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of the pool when they're by themselves after school.\u201d",

      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, said in an interview on Wednesday that the president-elect is exploring options to \u201cpreserve\u201d TikTok.",
      "Waltz made the comment when Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked him about a report from The Washington Post that said Trump was considering an executive order to suspend enforcement of a federal law that could ban the popular platform nationwide by Sunday.",
      "Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute brought by TikTok, its China-based parent company ByteDance, and users of the app. The Justices seemed likely to uphold the law, which requires ByteDance to divest TikTok on national security grounds or face a ban in one of its biggest markets.",
      "\u201cIf the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling in favor of the law, President Trump has been very clear: Number one, TikTok is a great platform that many Americans use and has been great for his campaign and getting his message out. But number two, he\u2019s going to protect their data,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a deal maker. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we\u2019re going to create this space to put that deal in place,\" he added.",
      "Separately on Wednesday, Pam Bondi, Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, dodged a question during a Senate hearing on whether she\u2019d uphold a TikTok ban.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral. He pledged to \u201csave TikTok\u201d during the campaign and has credited the platform with helping him win more youth votes.",

      "HONOLULU -- People were flocking to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on Wednesday to get a glimpse of fountaining lava.",
      "The eruption that began Dec. 23 in a crater at the summit of Kilauea volcano has paused periodically. It resumed Wednesday morning as a \u201csmall sluggish lava flow,\u201d and then increased into a fountain that appeared to be 200 feet (60 meters) high, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said.",
      "By the afternoon, visitors to the national park on the Big Island were able to see two fountains from an overlook.",
      "The observatory said it was possible fountain heights would increase as more gas-rich lava erupted.",
      "\u201cThe park is already very busy with people eager to see the eruption and we expect visitation to increase as the news gets out again,\u201d Jessica Ferracane, park spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Hawaii Volcanoes National Park encompasses the summits of two of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes: Kilauea and Mauna Loa.",
      "The eruption is visible from many public overlooks in the park. The lava is not posing a hazard to homes or infrastructure.",

      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery in southern Britain shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage",
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\u201cThat was really jaw-dropping \u2013 it\u2019s never been observed before in European prehistory,\u201d said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2013 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cit\u2019s your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife\u2019s family for land and livelihood,\u201d said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2013 called matrilocality \u2013 is historically rare.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2013 women leaving their homes to join their husband\u2019s family group \u2013 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives\u2019 extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2013 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2013 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain\u2019s Celtic society \u201cmore egalitarian than the Roman world,\u201d said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",

    "title": "Can AI help humans understand animals and reconnect with nature? A nonprofit research lab thinks so",

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "The two landers rocketed away in the middle of the night from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, the latest in a stream of private spacecraft aiming for the moon. They shared the ride to save money but parted company an hour into the flight exactly as planned, taking separate roundabout routes for the monthslong journey.",
      "It\u2019s take 2 for the Tokyo-based ispace, whose first lander crashed into the moon two years ago. This time, it has a rover on board with a scoop to gather up lunar dirt for study and plans to test potential food and water sources for future explorers.",
      "Lunar newcomer Texas-based Firefly Aerospace is flying 10 experiments for NASA, including a vacuum to gather dirt, a drill to measure the temperature below the surface and a device that could be used by future moonwalkers to keep the sharp, abrasive particles off their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a species of U.S. Southeastern fireflies \u2014 should reach the moon first. The 6-foot-6-inches-tall (2-meter-tall) lander will attempt a touchdown in early March at Mare Crisium, a volcanic plain in the northern latitudes.",
      "The slightly bigger ispace lander named Resilience will take four to five months to get there, targeting a touchdown in late May or early June at Mare Frigoris, even farther north on the moon\u2019s near side.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a race. Some people say \u2018race to the moon,\u2019 but it\u2019s not about the speed,\u201d ispace\u2019s founder CEO Takeshi Hakamada said this week from Cape Canaveral.",
      "Both Hakamada and Firefly CEO Jason Kim acknowledge the challenges still ahead, given the wreckage littering the lunar landscape. Only five countries have successfully placed spacecraft on the moon since the 1960s: the former Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can on the design and the engineering,\u201d Kim said. Even so, he pinned an Irish shamrock to his jacket lapel Tuesday night for good luck.",
      "The U.S. remains the only one to have landed astronauts. NASA\u2019s Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, aims to get astronauts back on the moon by the end of the decade.",
      "Before that can happen, \u201cwe\u2019re sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\u201d NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox said on the eve of launch.",
      "If acing their respective touchdowns, both spacecraft will spend two weeks operating in constant daylight, shutting down once darkness hits.",
      "Once lowered onto the lunar surface, ispace\u2019s 11-pound (5-kilogram) rover will stay near the lander, traveling up to hundreds of yards (meters) in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. The rover has its own special delivery to drop off on the lunar dust: a toy-size red house designed by a Swedish artist.",
      "NASA is paying $101 million to Firefly for the mission and another $44 million for the experiments. Hakamada declined to divulge the cost of ispace\u2019s rebooted mission with six experiments, saying it's less than the first mission that topped $100 million.",
      "Coming up by the end of February is the second moonshot for NASA by Houston-based Intuitive Machines. Last year, the company achieved the first U.S. lunar touchdown in more than a half-century, landing sideways near the south pole but still managing to operate.",

      "With a possible TikTok ban just days away, many U.S. users are looking for alternative social media platforms to help them keep up with pop culture or provide the type of entertaining videos that popularized the short-form video app.",
      "TikTok, which has been a cultural phenomenon, could be banned on Jan. 19 under a law that forces the platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or shut down its U.S. operation.",
      "The fate of social media platform will be decided by the Supreme Court, which last week heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute and seemed likely to uphold the law. The court could rule on the case as soon as this week. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the justices to put the law on hold so he can negotiate a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue after he takes office.",
      "TikTok has more than 170 million users in the U.S., and if it does get banned, it\u2019s not clear which competitors will benefit the most. Some experts think established social media platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, could see the biggest influx of users. But some users are looking for something different and could turn to other apps.",
      "Here are the different alternatives and what to know about them:",
      "Recently, some U.S. TikTok users have flocked to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu in protest of the looming ban. Like TikTok, Xiaohongshu, which in English means \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d combines e-commerce and short-form videos.",
      "The app has gained traction in China and other regions with a Chinese diaspora \u2014 such as Malaysia and Taiwan \u2014 racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as makeup and skincare tutorials.",
      "On Tuesday, the Xiaohongshu, called \u201cRedNote\u201d by American users and on some app stores, was the top downloaded free app in Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "Lemon8, also owned by TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, is a lesser-known lifestyle app that allows users to post pictures and short-form videos. Though the platform lets users post TikTok-like videos, it leans more into pictures and has been described as a mixture of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "In the past few weeks, many creators have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also recommended it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, indicating a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But the law that targets TikTok also states the divest-or-ban requirement for ByteDance applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by the two companies or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 is not explicitly named in the statute, its future in the U.S. is also in jeopardy.",
      "Instagram launched Reels in 2020, a TikTok-like feed of short videos users can create or scroll through. The feature has proven to be massively popular and some experts say creators are likely to set up shop there if a TikTok ban does happen. As of 2022, Instagram had 2 billion active monthly users. Meta no longer discloses user numbers for its individual platforms.",
      "But could it replace TikTok? That depends. While many creators currently post on both platforms, some experts say the youngest users are unlikely to migrate to a service made popular by their millennial parents. And while Meta\u2019s algorithm is addictive, it\u2019s still not TikTok.",
      "In the past, some TikTok users have also blamed the surge of scrutiny on the platform on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, pointing to a Washington Post report from 2022 that said the tech behemoth paid a Republican consulting firm to undermine TikTok through a nationwide media and lobbying campaign.",
      "Though TikTok dominates headlines as a driver of internet trends, Pew Research Center says YouTube is actually the most widely-used platform among teens and adults.",
      "YouTube users can scroll through Shorts just as they can on TikTok or Reels on Instagram and Facebook, allowing them to watch hours of bite-sized videos. Many of the videos featured on YouTube are from TikTok or creators who post to several platforms. That said, YouTube is still known for its longer-format videos so it may not have the variety of content that TikTok users are looking for \u2014 at least not yet.",
      "Snapchat, launched in 2011 with its infamous disappearing videos, remains popular among teens and younger adults. The platform gained so much traction that Meta designed a similar feature in Facebook and Instagram called \u201cStories\u201d that lets users post photos or videos that disappear within 24 hours. In 2020, Snapchat launched another feature that lets users \u201cshine a light on the most entertaining Snaps, no matter who created them.\u201d",
      "The platform is estimated to have roughly 692 million global monthly active users last year, according to eMarketer.",
      "For TikTok users who enjoy the \u201cTikTok Live\u201d feed that features livestreamed videos, Twitch could be a good alternative. The Amazon-owned platform is a leader in the streaming industry and allows users on the platform to watch some of the internet\u2019s most popular streamers, such as Kai Cenat. Twitch says it has 105 million monthly visitors.",
      "Clapper, a TikTok clone, has also been gaining some traction amid the looming ban. The app was launched in 2020 by Dallas-based entrepreneur Edison Chen, and focuses on Gen X and millennial users. In September of that year, the company described itself in a Facebook post as a \u201cfree speech\u201d platform that did not \u201ccensor posts and comments.\u201d But in blog post on its website from 2021, the company wrote it \u201cstopped being a \u2018Free Speech\u2019 platform\u201d in September 2020 and \u201cchanged its mission and goals\u201d to focus on \u201ccommunity\u201d.",
      "For TikTok users who want to get away from the overcrowded spots, there are lesser-known apps like Triller, which is popular for music videos, and Zigazoo, which was designed with kids in mind.",
      "If none of these apps tickle your fancy, it's also possible that other platforms could emerge in the next few months as companies attempt to attract users looking for a new place to go."

It provides a legal framework to ensure students only use such devices in cases of emergency and danger, for educational purposes, or if they have disabilities and require them.",
      "\"We cannot allow humanism to be replaced by algorithms,\u201d Lula said in a closed ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital, Brasilia, adding that the bill \u201cacknowledges the work of every serious person in education, everyone who wants to take care of children and teenagers in this country.\u201d",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, one of the world's highest figures.",
      "Education minister Camilo Santana told journalists that children are going online at early ages, making it harder for parents to keep track of what they do, and that restricting smartphones at school will help them.",
      "The bill had rare support across the political spectrum, both from allies of leftist Lula and his far-right foe, former President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "Many parents and students also approved the move. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents supported banning the use of smartphones by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",
      "\u201c(Restricting cell phones) is tough, but necessary. It is useful for them to do searches for school, but to use it socially isn't good,\u201d said Ricardo Martins Ramos, 43, father of two girls and the owner of a hamburger restaurant in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cKids will interact more.\u201d",
      "His 13-year-old daughter Isabela said her classmates struggled to focus during class because of their smartphones. She approved the move, but doesn't see it as enough to improve the learning environment for everyone.",
      "\"When the teacher lets you use the cell phone, it is because he wants you to do searches,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's still a lot of things that schools can't solve, such as bullying and harassment.\u201d",
      "As of 2023, about two-thirds of Brazilian schools imposed some restriction on cellphone use, while 28% banned them entirely, according to a survey released in August by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "The Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias have already passed local bills to ban such devices at schools. However, authorities have struggled to enforce these laws.",
      "Authorities in Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil, are discussing whether smartphones should be banned both in public and private schools.",
      "Gabriele Alexandra Henriques Pinheiro, 25, works at a beauty parlor and is the mother of a boy diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She also agrees with the restrictions, but says adults will continue to be a bad example of smartphone use for children.",
      "\u201cIt is tough,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to restrict the time my son watches any screens, but whenever I have a task to perform I have to use the smartphone to be able to do it all,\u201d she said.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",
      "Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms.",
      "An increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health.",
      "A report published in September by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, said one in four countries has already restricted the use of such devices at schools.",
      "Last year in a U.S. Senate hearing, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media. He also noted Meta\u2019s continued investments in \u201cindustrywide\u201d efforts to protect children.",

      "Agency official Shigeki Aoki told reporters that aftershocks were possible, especially in the next two or three days.",
      "The quake, centered at a depth of 36 kilometers (22 miles), shook a wide area in Kyushu, JMA said.",
      "NHK footage showed moving traffic and well-lit streets, meaning that electric power was still working. No problems were detected at nuclear plants in the area.",
      "Japan is frequently hit by earthquakes due to its location along the \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.",
      "Experts at the meteorological agency met late Monday to gauge how the latest temblor may be related to the so-called Nankai Trough quakes, but decided not to take any extraordinary measures for the time being. The term refers to a wide region believed to be prone to periodic major quakes.",
      "A Nankai Trough quake off Shikoku in 1946 killed more than 1,300 people. The area was hit by a 7.1 magnitude quake in August last year.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 23:21:37 -0500",
    "summary": "TikTok faces a ban on Sunday, unless it cuts ties with parent company ByteDance.",
    "story": [
      "Trump, who opposed the ban, has said he will seek to reverse it.",
      "Social media platform TikTok said it will be \"forced to go dark\" on Sunday unless the White House gives a \"definitive\" statement about its future, the company said in an announcement Friday night.",
      "The announcement came after the Supreme Court earlier in the day upheld a law set to ban TikTok unless the platform severs ties with China-based parent company ByteDance by Sunday.",
      "The Biden administration earlier Friday said it would not enforce the potential ban in the immediate aftermath of the deadline, leaving implementation of the law to President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Monday.",
      "However, TikTok said the messages from the Biden administration were not clear enough.",
      "\"The statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans,\" the social media company said in its statement. \"Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "In response to the TikTok statement, a White House official told ABC News late Friday the Biden administration has already gone to extraordinary lengths to communicate its position -- that it will be up to the incoming Trump administration to implement and enforce the law.",
      "Earlier Friday, shortly after the Supreme Court released its decision, the White House had said enforcement of the ban would fall to Trump because of timing.",
      "\"TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said after the ruling, adding, \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "Trump, who opposed the ban, has said he will seek to reverse it.",
      "\"The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\"",
      "The court's ruling was unanimous, with liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor and conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch writing concurring opinions.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the justices said in the ruling. \"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"",
      "It continues, \"For the foregoing Per Curiam reasons, we conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners' First Amendment rights. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed.\"",
      "In an apparent effort to limit the implications of its ruling, the court said its judgment should not be interpreted as a rebuke of common practices taken up by social media companies, such as data collection.",
      "\"We emphasize the inherent narrowness of our holding,\" the unsigned ruling says. \"Data collection and analysis is a common practice in this digital age. But TikTok's scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the Government's national security concerns.\"",
      "In its statement about going dark, TikTok also referenced statements from the Justice Department.",
      "Earlier Friday, Attorney General Merrick Garland released a statement reading: \"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security. Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data. The Court's decision affirms that this Act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution.\"",
      "Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement: \"The next phase of this effort \u2014 implementing and ensuring compliance with the law after it goes into effect on January 19 \u2014 will be a process that plays out over time.\"",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will attend Trump's inauguration after receiving an invitation from the incoming administration.",
      "Shou thanked Trump in a video posted to TikTok after the ruling by the Supreme Court.",
      "\"I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,\" he said.",
      "Shou added, \"We are grateful and please to have the support of a president who truly understands out platform -- one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process.",
      "Trump said he had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday morning with TikTok being one of the topics they discussed, according to a Truth Social post.",
      "TikTok -- which boasts more than 170 million U.S. users -- challenged the sale-or-ban law on First Amendment grounds, arguing that a potential ban would limit the free-expression rights of its users.",
      "Lower courts, however, found merit in security concerns about potential data collection or content manipulation undertaken by the Chinese government.",
      "Even after the ban takes effect, TikTok could remain available for U.S. users.",
      "Rather than force TikTok to take the app dark, the law targets third-party companies like cloud-service providers and app stores. TikTok could circumvent such restrictions, at least temporarily, though experts say the quality of the app would degrade over time.",

      "\"As we turned the corner, I could see flames just going and I was like, that is right next to our home, if it's not our home,\" Garcia recalled, adding that \"there were embers everywhere.\"",
      "\"When we pulled up to my home, the house next to us, the tree and the back house were on fire. And I was like, 'We can't go in. We can't go in. This is terrifying.'\"",
      "Garcia estimates that her house -- nicknamed the \"Dodger house\" because it was painted blue and white like the Los Angeles Dodgers colors and which Garcia referred to as her \"forever home\" -- caught fire and was gone within six hours.",
      "Garcia said seeing the ruins of her home, which they had already started filling with baby items and a crib in preparation for their baby's March 28 arrival, was \"surreal\" and felt like \"a movie.\"",
      "But Garcia said the worst part for her was seeing her family members, who have also lived in Altadena for generations, lose their homes and all of their possessions as well.",
      "\"The thing that's been most challenging for me is that it's a multi-loss,\" she continued, adding that it wasn't just her home that had been destroyed but also her parents' home, her cousin's home and her uncle's home in a community that's near and dear to her heart.",
      "\"Altadena is such a special city. One of most amazing things about Altadena is that it has multi-generational families \u2026 primarily African American, Latino families that own property, which in Los Angeles is kind of unheard of,\" Garcia said of her hometown.",
      "As Garcia and Figueroa begin to figure out what they will do next after the Eaton Fire changed their lives overnight, Garcia said she's living at a relative's home in Marina Del Rey for the time being and trying to focus on staying healthy in the final weeks of her pregnancy.",
      "\"There's so many things to process. I've just found it helpful to list everything and anything just to figure out how to get through every day,\" the expectant mom said. \"When you've lost everything, all you can do is rebuild, and I keep laughing with people and with my family, telling them that we're going to have one hell of a story to tell my baby.\"",

      "\"They took me off the rig just to get some relief, you know, get some rest. I asked 'em, 'Hey, can we please go by my house to see if it's still standing?'\" Yu recalled. \"So we came up, and it was gone. It was burned to the ground.\"",

      "Despite the enormous personal toll, Hawes and his fellow firefighters are still back at work and fighting multiple active fires, including the Palisades Fire and Eaton Fire in Los Angeles County and the Auto Fire in Ventura County.",
      "\"Unfortunately, I don't think you really have an opportunity to just kind of roll over and give up with this job. We have a duty to serve the community,\" Hawes said. \"I needed time to be with my family and spend time with my family. That was a priority. But I had to also give time to my community and get back to the community, work with the coworkers, get back in it.\"",
      "The firefighters say the bond between them and their families is what's helping them get through these difficult times.",

    "summary": "After years of flooding and two presidential administrations, homeowners in Shiloh say they are still waiting for state and federal agencies to make them whole.",
    "story": [
      "Advocates followed top federal officials around the country to call for action.",
      "At a recent church service in Cleveland, a group of visitors from a rural Alabama community nearly 900 miles away, including pastor and business owner Timothy Williams, joined congregants in singing the spiritual \"I Don't Mind Waiting.\"",
      "Williams has grown used to waiting.",
      "After six years of frequent flooding, two presidential administrations and numerous reassurances from top officials, homeowners like Williams who live in the majority-Black Shiloh community say they are still waiting for state and federal agencies to make them whole.",
      "Now, with the Biden administration ending Monday, they feel they are running out of time.",
      "\"The longer they put us on hold, things are getting worse and worse,\" said Williams, who has been advocating for Shiloh since 2018, after community members say a project by the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) to widen an adjacent highway led to flooding on their properties.",
      "When the state denied responsibility for the flooding, community leaders turned to the federal government for help. In September 2022, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration opened an investigation into their concerns.",
      "The administration says it aims to complete investigations within six months, but after a year with no resolution, Shiloh residents focused their efforts on reaching the top transportation official in America: U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",
      "Shiloh residents became hopeful last spring when Buttigieg traveled to their community to see how runoff from the expanded highway drained onto their properties. He toured the historic community, listening to residents and telling them Washington would make things right.",
      "The people of Shiloh say they were optimistic about what was to come, but when the federal investigation came to a close in October -- more than two years after it began -- the resulting Voluntary Resolution Agreement with ALDOT fell short of their expectations.",
      "The deal required the state to mitigate future flooding in Shiloh, but it did not address existing property damage. It also did not assign blame for the flooding, raising questions as to whether any government entity is liable for compensating the residents for their losses.",
      "\"We are closely coordinating with the Federal Highway Administration on our efforts to follow through with the terms of the Voluntary Resolution Agreement,\" ALDOT spokesperson Tony Harris told ABC News.",
      "On the brink of yet another administration change, Williams wants Buttigieg to commit more resources to Shiloh in his final days in office.",
      "\"We want him to give us a binding written agreement that will cover the damages of the people's homes and their properties and make the people whole,\" Williams said. \"That's all we're asking him to do and he can do that.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Transportation, however, said the secretary cannot meet this demand.",
      "\"Congress has not authorized any programs or funding for DOT that can provide emergency relief directly to communities experiencing hardship, so this whole-of-government approach is critical to help the Shiloh community access federal assistance that is not available through DOT alone,\" the spokesperson told ABC News.",
      "The flooding in Shiloh has consequences ranging from transportation to housing to environment, spanning the jurisdictions of a web of federal agencies. Some of these departments are involved in a task force led by the U.S. Transportation Department to identify resources available for Shiloh, Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson James Pinkney told ABC News.",
      "\"EPA shared all funding opportunities and technical assistance available to the community,\" Pinkney wrote, adding that Shiloh community members applied for an EPA grant program in November.",
      "Since the Voluntary Resolution Agreement did not assign liability for the flooding, the responsibility for finding government funds to fix the flood damage has largely fallen to the Shiloh community members. They now say they've been wading through red tape while their homes fill with water.",
      "With the clock ticking toward another Trump administration, Shiloh community leaders are worried they'll be left behind. They aren't waiting for federal agencies to come to them anymore.",
      "In December, Williams and his daughters traveled from Alabama to Ohio, where Buttigieg was scheduled to speak before the City Club of Cleveland.",
      "In his address, Buttigieg discussed the accomplishments of his administration, including tackling infrastructure inequities in vulnerable communities.",
      "\"Many communities had transportation projects done to them rather than with them, often because they lacked the wealth or political power to resist or reshape them,\" Buttigieg said.",
      "Listening closely alongside the Williams family were some of their supporters: Shiloh-area native Dr. Robert Bullard, known as the \"father of environmental justice\" for his pioneering research, and representatives from the Sierra Club.",
      "\"The point of transportation is to connect, and yet there were so many places where transportation functioned to divide, sometimes contributing to racial and economic divisions,\" Buttigieg told the audience. \"We can do something about it, and we are.\"",
      "In the case of Shiloh, however, what exactly can be done and who should do it remains unclear. All the while, the flooding continues.",
      "When asked by ABC News if he would meet with the Shiloh families who'd come to Cleveland, Buttigieg said he \"would want to take that up directly with them.\"",
      "\"We'll continue to do everything we can, both within and beyond any kind of formal and official steps, to try to support that community because I'll never forget what they're going through,\" Buttigieg said.",
      "After they were denied another meeting with the secretary, Williams and Bullard put together a petition with roughly 5,000 signatures demanding a binding agreement to cover damage to residents' properties.",
      "On Tuesday, the group traveled another 900 miles, heading to Washington to deliver their petition directly to the U.S. Transportation Department before Buttigieg's term ends.",
      "\"We want to see a victory,\" Bullard said. \"How this community overcame all odds and got the resources from the federal government to make them whole.\"",
      "Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous joined the group to call for justice in Shiloh.",
      "\"Their community's been turned into a drainage ditch by the Alabama Department of Transportation with U.S. Department of Transportation dollars,\" Jealous said.",
      "After relentless flooding and tireless advocacy, Shiloh's 150-year legacy still hangs in the balance. While Washington politics churn on, their homes continue to sink and runoff drowns their generational wealth.",
      "Bullard stressed that there is still time for Washington to act.",
      "\"It's already been two administrations that have allowed this to happen,\" Bullard said. \"This should not -- and must not -- bleed into a third administration.\"",

      "DEERFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions in the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids, according to a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",
      "Walgreens, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 locations, said in a statement that it stands behind its pharmacists. It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

      "The U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights released guidance Thursday that says colleges and universities must make financial assistance funds from name, image, and likeness (NIL)-related compensation \"proportionately\" available to female and male athletes.",
      "The OCR enforces Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination by schools and the programs that receive federal financial assistance. This means schools are required to provide equal opportunity to all student-athletes through access to benefits, opportunities, treatment, financial assistance and scholarship, and accommodations.",
      "A school that awards athletic financial assistance -- such as NIL-based funds -- is required under Title IX to \u201cprovide reasonable opportunities for such awards for members of each sex in proportion to the number of students of each sex participating in interscholastic or intercollegiate athletics,\" according to the nine-page memo.",
      "The regulation does not require that male and female student-athletes are given the same number of awards or that awards are of the same value. Instead, the agency says it will assess \"whether the total amount of athletic financial assistance made available by the school to men and women is substantially proportionate to the number of students of each sex participating in interscholastic or intercollegiate athletics at that school.\"",
      "This includes taking into account how the school aids its student-athletes in getting NIL agreements through means like publicity or support services. However, the agency said it will take into account disparities brought by \"nondiscriminatory\" factors.",
      "The agency states that it does not view NIL-related compensation provided by a third party as athletic financial assistance that would be under similar anti-discrimination requirements.",
      "It is unclear how this will impact how schools navigate NIL compensation and sports representation. The vast majority of NIL profits favor football and men's basketball, according to research from Opendorse, an NIL-focused research group.",
      "An analysis by ESPN, which shares the parent company Disney with ABC News, found that most of the Power 5 athletic departments disproportionately posted men's teams on social media more than women's. This disparity stood strong despite women's teams outnumbering men's teams at almost all of the schools it analyzed.",
      "The memo comes as the University of Oregon faces a lawsuit seeking class action certification and alleging Title IX violations over NILs, in which female student-athletes allege that the school failed to offer female student-athletes the same treatment or benefits that it gave to their male counterparts.",
      "In the complaint, the athletes argued that male student-athletes received benefits such as: \u201cstate-of-the-art, personalized gear and equipment in seemingly endless quantities; preferential scheduling for training, practices, and games; chartered flights to away games; hotel stays before home games ... round-the-clock access to trainers and medical professionals; nearly-unlimited publicity, including to advance their name, image, and likeness (NIL) opportunities and income; highly-paid coaches and assistant coaches with plush offices and special amenities, including their own hot tub; and myriad other forms of support that one can hardly imagine.\"",
      "The school denied the claim in a March 2024 response to the complaint, saying it wants all athletes \u201cto flourish\u201d and listed many steps it has taken to benefit female athletes, including noting that it has been \"fundraising for an identified, centrally located, women\u2019s beach volleyball facility located in the heart of the University of Oregon\u2019s campus.\"",
      "The response read: \"There is no evidence that the University of Oregon engaged in gender discrimination against any of its student-athletes, female or male, past or current. The specious comparison of women\u2019s beach volleyball to football is not how a proper Title IX analysis works. This comparison disregards the clearly equitable treatment and benefits provided overall to male and female student-athletes across the University of Oregon\u2019s athletic department.\""

      "Zandstra was charged in the summer of 2023 with kidnapping and killing Gretchen Harrington, who disappeared in 1975 while walking alone to a Bible camp at a chapel where Zandstra was a pastor. Her body was found two months later by a jogger in Ridley Creek State Park in Media, Pennsylvania.",
      "Harrington was offered a ride by Zandstra the day she disappeared, the Delaware County district attorney said when the charges were filed. Prosecutors said Zandstra had confessed to the killing after investigators received new information and then interviewed the retired minister.",
      "His attorney, Mark Much, told jurors that detectives pressured and tricked Zandstra into confessing to a crime he didn't commit. Defense attorneys said there was no physical evidence linking the retired minister to the girl's death and that police had investigated other suspects who were more likely to be the killer.",
      "Defense attorney Christopher Boggs told The Philadelphia Inquirer that Zandstra\u2019s family was glad he could come home after 18 months in custody.",
      "In the days after the girl disappeared, hundreds of people searched nearby wooded areas, and authorities distributed more than 2,000 leaflets and set up a 24-hour hotline that took hundreds of calls, The Inquirer reported.",

      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- A new year of lawmaking and politicking is underway in U.S. statehouses. Governors are acting quickly to outline their agendas. And in many cases, the influence of President-elect Donald Trump already is rippling through states in both symbolic and substantive ways.",
      "Some state officials are trying to tackle concerns that propelled Trump to office such as the economy, affordable living and immigration. Some are mimicking Trump\u2019s government efficiency panel, though they lack a headlining billionaire like Elon Musk to lead it. And many have waded into the debate about whether U.S. flags should fly high on Inauguration Day to honor the new president or remain low to honor a deceased predecessor.",
      "Those themes were prominent over the past two weeks as state legislatures convened, new governors took the oath of office and incumbent governors laid out their agendas in formal \u201cstate of the state\u201d addresses.",
      "Just as Trump plans an array of actions on Day 1, some governors were quick to sign various proclamations and declarations.",
      "Within minutes of taking office, Republican Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe issued several anti-crime orders, including Trump-themed moves requiring training for state troopers to aid federal immigration authorities and requiring law enforcement agencies to document the immigration status of people they arrest.",
      "Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a special legislative session to begin Jan. 27, the week after Trump is sworn in, to ensure the state can \u201chelp the Trump administration enforce our nation\u2019s immigration laws.\u201d Republican Tennessee Gov.

      "The Minnesota House is even more closely divided. Republicans hold a temporary 67-66 majority until a special election can be held to fill a vacant seat in a heavily Democratic district. That is expected to yield a tied chamber.",
      "So far, things are off to a rocky start. Democrats have boycotted floor sessions to prevent a quorum while Republicans have plowed ahead by electing their top leader as speaker and appointing committee chairs. The state Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments Thursday on whether the GOP\u2019s moves are legal.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland came in with a mission to calm the waters at the Justice Department and restore its reputation for independence after four turbulent years during Donald Trump's presidency",
      "WASHINGTON -- During hearings on Merrick Garland's nomination to be President Joe Biden's attorney general, the longtime federal appeals court judge told senators in 2021 that he hoped to \u201cturn down the volume\u201d on the public discourse about the Justice Department and return to the days when the agency was not the \u201ccenter of partisan disagreement.\u201d",
      "It didn\u2019t go as planned.",
      "Garland came in with a mission to calm the waters and restore the department's reputation for independence after four turbulent years under Republican President Donald Trump, who fired one attorney general and feuded with another. Now the soft-spoken Garland, who was denied a seat on the Supreme Court by the Republican-led Senate before Trump's 2016 election, is leaving with the department under siege on all sides and his own legacy in question.",
      "Those on the right are incensed over the department\u2019s effort to hold Trump criminally responsible for his failed effort to overturn his 2020 election loss, and have accused prosecutors of going too easy on Biden's son Hunter. Democrats have claimed Garland failed to pursue Trump aggressively enough immediately after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, and have criticized Garland's reliance on a special counsel, who, they thought, took gratuitous swipes at Biden.",
      "Some senior Biden aides have said privately that Garland was the wrong choice for the job and they believe he bent too far backward to show he wasn't protecting the Democratic president.",
      "Garland must now hand the department back to Trump, who has suggested he'll try to use the executive agency to exact revenge against his perceived enemies. Trump has nominated his personal lawyers and loyalists to run the Cabinet department, and they have promised to clean house of officials they consider part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d working against Trump.",
      "People close to Garland say he was dealt a monumentally difficult hand, taking over at a deeply divisive political time after the riot and inheriting a department shaken to its core during Trump\u2019s first term. Garland faced one politically sensitive matter after another.",
      "\u201cWhat Merrick Garland had to deal with: confronting Jan. 6 and its aftermath, the investigations into the president's son ... it's just a series of almost impossible decisions that were going to have huge ramifications for the country and the body politic,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, the third-highest ranking Justice Department official under Garland until leaving government last year. \u201cI just don't think any AG in recent time has had to confront that constellation of really, really difficult questions.\"",
      "The Justice Department declined to make Garland available for an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "His defenders say that despite the political pressures, he stood firm in his commitment to independence and impartiality.",
      "\u201cWhat the AG brought is energetic and compassionate leadership \u2014 leadership that was about reinvigorating the institution as an institution,\" said Marshall Miller, principal associate deputy attorney general before recently leaving the department. \u201cI think that\u2019s critically important to the longevity of the institution \u2014 to have attorneys general who understand its history and its norms and buttress those.\u201d",
      "Yet in a hyperpartisan era, Garland's approach managed to anger just about everyone outside the department. Garland pushed back forcefully at times, such as when he told lawmakers during a congressional hearing, \u201cI will not be intimidated.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe story that has been told by some outside of this building about what has happened inside of it is wrong,\u201d he told employees Thursday during an emotional farewell address inside the Justice Department's Great Hall. \"You have worked to pursue justice \u2014 not politics. That is the truth and nothing can change it.\u201d",
      "But Garland never seemed fully comfortable in the media spotlight, and some wonder whether he should have made clearer to the country why the department did what it did. There were not only attacks from Republicans alleging \u201cweaponization\u201d of the department for political purposes and but also claims by the president who had picked him about a politicized justice system.",
      "\u201cMerrick Garland has not, I think, been a very effective public defender of the integrity and impartiality of the Department of Justice,\u201d Andrew Kent, a Fordham University law school professor, said in an email. Given the issues the department faced, Garland needed \"to explain to the public more frequently and more specifically how the Department\u2019s actions are consistent with a commitment to nonpartisan and impartial justice.\"",
      "Garland was the chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where presidents have often searched for Supreme Court justices, when he was nominated by President Barack Obama in March 2016. But in a stunning display of partisanship, Republican senators led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky refused to vote on the nomination, saying it had come too close to the November election and the next president should make the choice.",
      "Garland told CBS' \u201c60 Minutes\u201d years later that it was an \u201cenormous honor\u201d to be chosen. \u201cSo I was of course, a human being, very disappointed,\" he said. But, quoting Taylor Swift, he said, \"As you know my favorite poet says \u2014 you got to shake it off.\"",
      "Garland remained on the appeals court until he was nominated by Biden as attorney general.",
      "A detail-oriented leader known for asking probing questions in meetings, Garland spent much of his career as a Justice Department lawyer and worked under five attorneys general. He burnished his reputation as a hard-charging prosecutor supervising the case against Timothy McVeigh for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people. Garland has called his work on the investigation \u201cthe most important thing\u201d he has ever done. On the wall in his Justice Department office is a framed photo of the destroyed Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.",
      "Those close to Garland say he has been a fierce defender of the department and has not been afraid to take arrows, such as when he announced \u2014 amid heavy criticism of the FBI \u2014 that he had personally approved the decision to seek a warrant to search Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in 2022 for classified documents. Inside the department, Garland's allies say, he succeeded in restoring calm and strengthening morale after years of firings and other scandals under Trump.",
      "While Garland's predecessor, William Barr, publicly criticized career prosecutors, Garland praised department lawyers as the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the workforce. A steadfast institutionalist, Garland would often get emotional when talking publicly about the department's work and its staff.",
      "\u201cHe did so much to restore the morale of career folks in the department, to restore normal order of decision making,\u201d said Gupta, the former associate attorney general.",
      "On civil rights matters, the Justice Department under Garland undertook a dozen investigations into law enforcement agencies, uncovering widespread abuse and misconduct \u2014 work that had been curtailed under Trump's first term. The department was also aggressive in its antitrust enforcement, bringing cases against Google, Apple and others.",
      "But it always came back to political investigations.",
      "Garland was hardly the first attorney general to find himself mired in politically sensitive investigations. Prosecutors in the Obama era investigated both the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, and the Trump campaign in 2016. Trump\u2019s Justice Department, through a special counsel, investigated him.",
      "But the confluence of investigations on his desk at once presented arguably the biggest test in the Justice Department\u2019s 150-year history.",
      "The department, at one point, was investigating Joe Biden for his handling of classified documents, Hunter Biden for tax and gun offenses, and Trump \u2014 the president's chief political rival. To do this, Garland appointed special counsels in an effort to remove any whiff of political bias.",
      "Yet no event shaped Garland\u2019s tenure more than the Capitol riot, which unfolded on live TV on the same day news broke that Biden had picked Garland for the job.",
      "By the time Garland was sworn in as attorney general in March 2021, the Justice Department had begun charging rioters, building what would become the largest investigation in its history.",
      "Garland would not say publicly whether the department was investigating Trump, but insisted investigators were pursuing Jan. 6 perpetrators \u201cat any level.\u201d In November 2022 \u2014 days after Trump formally launched his 2024 candidacy \u2014 Garland announced he had appointed special counsel Jack Smith to lead the investigation and a separate inquiry into Trump's retention of classified documents.",
      "The classified documents investigation was seen as more straightforward, given the breadth of evidence that prosecutors said they had accumulated. Yet that case, too, stalled amid a series of rulings from the trial judge that delayed its progression before its ultimate dismissal last July.",
      "Critics, meanwhile, fretted about the pace.",
      "\"What should have happened in real time was a special counsel should have been appointed to investigate January 6th with more urgency than we now know happened,\" said Jed Shugerman, a Boston University law professor.",
      "Garland's defenders reject any suggestion the attorney general dragged his feet. Long before Smith was appointed, the department in 2021 launched an investigative unit looking at Trump allies who were at Washington's Willard Hotel around Jan. 6, 2021. Investigators searched for financial ties between Trump allies and the rioters \u2014 which, if found, officials believed could have allowed them to bring a more straightforward case. But that hit a dead end.",
      "The investigation got bogged down in court fights around executive privilege and other matters. The Supreme Court tied up Smith's case for months before granting former presidents broad immunity from prosecution and sending the case back to the trial court. It likely would have gone back to the high court at least once or twice before it could reach trial, making a trial before November's election unlikely, even if the charges had come months earlier.",
      "\u201cJan. 6 was one of the most polarizing events in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d said Jamie Gorelick, a close friend of Garland's who was deputy attorney general in the Justice Department under former President Bill Clinton. \u201cI think he did as well as he could, but institutionally, it has been a tremendously challenging matter to deal with ... and it has been a tremendously challenging fact of life in our society.\u201d",
      "But while the cases against Trump moved through the courts, Trump was surging back to political prominence. He had been convicted in New York City in a state hush-money trial and still would go on to seize the nomination, casting himself as the victim of a politically motivated justice system and pledging to seek revenge on his enemies.",
      "\u201cFor too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans \u2014 Not anymore,\u201d Trump said when announcing that he would nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to lead the department.",
      "Inside the White House, frustration mounted over Garland. Biden felt hemmed in by his choice, particularly as the Justice Department investigated both him and Hunter.",
      "White House officials were particularly dismayed at special counsel Robert Hur's report on his investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents. That report portrayed the president as a \u201cwell-meaning elderly man with a poor memory,\" and White House officials said it was inappropriate to include such \u201cprejudicial\u201d language in a report explaining why no criminal charges were warranted.",
      "The report was released just as Biden's age (he turned 82 in November) and mental acuity were becoming major political liabilities that would eventually, following his disastrous debate performance in June, sink his reelection effort.",
      "Garland said the idea that he would edit or censor Hur's report was \u201cabsurd.\u201d That may have frustrated the White House but it also spared Garland the groundswell of criticism he would have encountered from the right had he stepped in to shade the special counsel\u2019s findings.",
      "By releasing the entire document in unedited form, Garland reflected his determination not only to avoid the appearance of being the president\u2019s protector but also to turn the page from his predecessor. Barr was castigated by the left after he issued his own four-page summary of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election interference that was seen as glossing over some of the document\u2019s more damning assessments.",
      "Republicans in the House, angry over what they viewed as the Biden Justice Department's unfair treatment of Trump, later voted to hold Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio of Biden's interview with Hur.",
      "Garland is about to see years of work dismantled when the new administration takes over.",
      "The cases against Trump have unraveled. The Justice Department has decided to withhold from the public for now the section of Smith's final report on Trump's classified documents case because an appeal involving Trump's co-defendants is pending. It's possible that will never be seen by the public because Trump's Justice Department almost certainly will not release it.",
      "The future of the Jan. 6 investigation, which has resulted in more than 1,200 convictions against rioters, is in peril. Trump has said he plans to pardon many of them.",
      "Biden, too, pardoned his son after Hunter's trial conviction and guilty plea. Justice Department officials were surprised and frustrated by Biden's statement claiming the case against his son had been politicized, especially after the president's repeated vows to respect the rule of law.",
      "Justice Department staff lined up Friday to cheer for Garland as he left the building. Several employees wiped tears and hugged as the SUV he climbed into drove off.",
      "In his final speech to the workforce, Garland made no overt mention of Trump or the president-elect's suggestions that he might use the agency's powers to go after his foes. But Garland warned that \u201cthe same powers that enable the federal prosecutor to pursue justice also create the potential for grave injustice.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must understand that there is a difference between what we can do \u2014 and what we should do,\u201d Garland said.",

    "story": [
      "TikTok arrived in the U.S. almost 6 1/2 years ago",
      "The possibility of the U.S. outlawing TikTok kept influencers and users in anxious limbo during the four-plus years that lawmakers and judges debated the fate of the video-sharing app. Now, the moment its fans dreaded is here, but uncertainty over TikTok\u2019s future lingers.",
      "On Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that bans the immensely popular, trend-setting social media platform starting Sunday unless its China-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., sells to an approved buyer.",
      "The unanimous decision ended a legal battle that pitted national security concerns against free speech rights. TikTok, ByteDance and some of the devoted users who rely on the platform for entertainment, income and community argued the statute violated the First Amendment. The Biden administration sought to show ByteDance\u2019s ownership and control of TikTok posed an unacceptable threat.",
      "The Supreme Court ruling, however, is not guaranteed to end the TikTok saga, which has become enveloped in the wider battle between Beijing and Washington. A Biden administration official told The Associated Press on Thursday that the outgoing administration would leave the law's implementation \u2014 and potential enforcement \u2014 to President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Trump, who is set to return to the White House the day after the ban takes effect, has credited TikTok with helping him win the support of more young voters in last year\u2019s election. A Trump adviser said this week that the incoming administration would \u201cput measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark.\u201d What those measures will look like \u2014 and if they can withstand legal scrutiny \u2014 remained unknown Saturday.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at how TikTok became a global cultural phenomenon and the political wrangling that followed the app's commercial success:",
      "TikTok is one of more than 100 apps developed in the past decade by ByteDance, a technology firm founded in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming and headquartered in Beijing\u2019s northwestern Haidian district.",
      "In 2016, ByteDance launched a short-form video platform called Douyin in China and followed up with an international version called TikTok. It then bought Musical.ly, a lip-syncing platform popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined it with TikTok while keeping the app separate from Douyin.",
      "Soon after, the app boomed in popularity in the U.S. and many other countries, becoming the first Chinese platform to make serious inroads in the West. Unlike other social media platforms that focused on cultivating connections among users, TikTok tailored content to people\u2019s interests.",
      "The often silly videos and music clips content creators posted gave TikTok an image as a sunny corner of the internet where users could find fun and a sense of authenticity. Finding an audience on the platform helped launch the careers of music artists like Lil Nas X.",
      "TikTok gained more traction during the shutdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic, when short dances that went viral became a mainstay of the app. To better compete, Instagram and YouTube eventually came out with their own tools for making short-form videos, respectively known as Reels and Shorts. By that point, TikTok was a bona fide hit.",
      "Challenges came in tandem with TikTok\u2019s success. U.S. officials expressed concerns about the company\u2019s roots and ownership, pointing to laws in China that require Chinese companies to hand over data requested by the government. Another concern became the proprietary algorithm that populates what users see on the app.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump issued executive orders in 2020 banning TikTok and the Chinese messaging app WeChat, moves that courts subsequently blocked. India banned TikTok \u2014 along with other Chinese apps \u2014 the same year following a military clash along the India-China border that killed 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers.",
      "In 2021, the Biden administration dropped the Trump-era orders but left in place a national security review of TikTok by a little-known government agency known as Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.",
      "Between January 2021 and August 2022, representatives for TikTok engaged in serious negotiations with the Biden administration about the app\u2019s future in the U.S. The talks resulted in a 90-page draft security agreement that the company presented to CFIUS in August 2022. The two sides then ceased substantive negotiations, according to TikTok\u2019s attorneys, though some meetings also took place in following months.",
      "A copy of the draft agreement submitted in court showed that it would have opened up TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform for security inspections and blocked access of U.S. user data from China. The company says it has already implemented some provisions of the agreement, including routing U.S. user data to servers operated by software giant Oracle.",
      "In its lawsuit to overturn the sell-or-ban law, the company said it spent more than $2 billion to implement aspects of its appeasement plan, which it calls Project Texas.",
      "But the Department of Justice and administration officials argued in court documents that the proposal failed to create sufficient separation between TikTok's U.S. operations and China. They also said the opacity of TikTok\u2019s algorithm, coupled with the size and technical complexity of the platform, made it impossible for the U.S. government \u2013 or its technology provider, Oracle \u2013 to effectively guarantee compliance with the proposal.",
      "In February 2023, the White House directed federal agencies to remove TikTok from government-issued devices, mirroring some other countries that also prohibited the use of the app on official devices.",
      "The following month, lawmakers grilled TikTok CEO Shou Chew during an hours-long hearing in which he sought to reassure a tense House committee that the platform prioritized user safety and should not be banned due to its Chinese connections.",
      "According to court documents, TikTok\u2019s representatives had their last meeting with CFIUS in September 2023. Later that year, criticism against the platform increased in volume among Republicans in Washington who claimed the platform amplified pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel content, an accusation the company vigorously denied.",
      "Efforts to ban TikTok resurfaced in Congress early last year, and quickly gained bipartisan support among lawmakers who voiced about the potential for the platform to surveil and manipulate Americans.",
      "The legislation the Supreme Court upheld passed the House and the Senate in April after it was included as part of a high-priority $95 billion package that provided foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel. President Joe Biden quickly signed it, and the two companies and a group of content creators quickly sued.",
      "A lower court upheld the statute in early December. The legislation gave ByteDance nine months from the enactment date to sell TikTok, and a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress.",
      "The deadline's arrival the day before Trump\u2019s inauguration makes things tricky. Only the sitting president can issue a 90-day stay on the ban and can do so only if a buyer has taken concrete steps toward a purchase.",
      "Although experts have said the app would not disappear from existing users\u2019 phones Sunday, new users won\u2019t be able to download it and updates won\u2019t be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department has said in court filings."

      "Some of the same Donald Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol four years ago are allowed to return to Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- Thousands of Donald Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol after he lost the 2020 presidential election. Four years later, some of them are allowed to return to the nation's capital so they can celebrate Trump's return to the White House.",
      "At least 20 defendants charged with or convicted of joining the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol have asked federal judges for permission to attend President-elect Trump's second inauguration Monday in Washington, D.C., according to an Associated Press review of court records.",
      "The majority can go. Several others cannot.",
      "In most cases, Justice Department prosecutors have argued that Capitol riot defendants shouldn't be able to return to the scene of their crimes while they're under the court's supervision.",
      "\"What\u2019s past is prologue, and the defendants could easily find themselves in another situation where they engage in mob violence,\u201d a prosecutor wrote in opposing a New York couple's travel request.",
      "At least 11 defendants have received the court's permission to attend the inauguration, a day when Trump may issue mass pardons to Capitol rioters. Judges have denied requests made by at least seven others.",
      "Many other convicted Capitol rioters may be free to attend if they have completed their sentences. Typically, those who remain under the court's supervision after an arrest, a probation sentence or release from prison must get a judge's approval to travel outside their home district.",
      "Among those who can attend is Deborah Lynn Lee, a Pennsylvania woman accused of posting social media messages calling for the execution of her political opponents in the days leading up to the riot. Lee was charged in August 2021, was convicted of four misdemeanors after a trial in October and is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 27.",
      "Justice Department prosecutor Carlos Valdivia argued that Lee's return to Washington would endanger Capitol police officers and \u201ccreate an absurd situation.\u201d",
      "\"Lee\u2019s presence in D.C. was restricted for years to keep the community safe, but in a few days, she would be allowed to return to attend a ceremony that demands heightened security,\u201d Valdivia wrote.",
      "Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui approved Lee's request, noting that she isn't accused of engaging in violence and has complied with her release conditions. The magistrate said Lee \u201cis coming to celebrate, not demonstrate\u201d this time.",
      "\u201cWhile the Court is tasked with predicting the future, this is not \u2018Minority Report.\u2019 There has to be credible evidence of future danger to justify related release conditions,\u201d Faruqui wrote.",
      "District Judge John Bates agreed to let a New York couple, Carol Moore and Kevin Moore, attend the inauguration while awaiting a trial in April. Prosecutors argued that police officers could be \"retraumatized\" by the Moores' presence, but Bates said it was unlikely that any officers at the inauguration would recognize them.",
      "\u201cFirst, past is not prologue here,\" the judge wrote. \"The nature of the inauguration is wholly different from the last event the Moores attended that involved the transition of power. Put simply, the inauguration will involve a crowd largely supporting the peaceful transition of power, not opposing it.\u201d",
      "The couple's attorney said the Moores plan to join others in displaying signs reading \u201cDay One\" \u2014 an appeal for Trump to make good on a campaign promise to pardon Capitol rioters on his first day back in office. Trump repeatedly has referred to Jan. 6 defendants as \u201chostages\u201d and \u201cpatriots.\u201d",
      "The list of Jan. 6 riot defendants allowed to be in Washington on Monday also includes a New Jersey man who reported himself to the FBI, a New Hampshire woman who must serve a four-month prison sentence and a New Jersey man accused of using a bullhorn to encourage other rioters.",
      "Prosecutors didn\u2019t object to allowing Colorado bed-and-breakfast operator Rebecca Lavrenz \u2014 the self-described \u201cJ6 praying grandma\u201d \u2014 to attend the inauguration while she is on probation. Lavrenz said her daughter is serving as the deputy director of Monday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony after working on Trump\u2019s campaign last year.",
      "Among those barred from attending the inauguration are Jared Miller, a Virginia man charged with assaulting police. Miller's attorney, Stephen Brennwald, said Monday's inauguration presents a \"completely different scenario\" than the 2021 riot. The lawyer also argued that his client's conduct that day is irrelevant to his travel request.",
      "\u201cNo longer will the participants and observers be in the District out of anger, ready to fight to try to wrest back the power they felt had been unjustly taken from them. Rather, they will be cheering the person they support, and law enforcement will not be in an antagonistic position to those attending the event,\u201d Brennwald wrote.",
      "District Judge Rudolph Contreras denied Miller's request, pointing to his assault charges.",
      "Russell Taylor, a California man who had a knife and a hatchet in his possession when he helped other rioters overrun a police line outside the Capitol, said he was invited to attend the inauguration by former U.S. Rep. Chris Stewart, a six-term Utah Republican who resigned in 2023.",
      "District Judge Royce Lamberth, who sentenced Taylor to six months of home detention, said it wouldn't be appropriate to allow somebody who tried to thwart the last presidential inauguration to attend \u201csuch a hallowed event.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo attend the Presidential Inauguration, which celebrates and honors the peaceful transfer of power, is an immense privilege,\" Lamberth wrote.",
      "Judges also rejected the travel requests made by a North Carolina man who participated in the first act of violence against Capitol police on Jan. 6, a Mississippi man charged with assaulting officers with a flagpole and a Maine man accused of attacking police with bear spray.",

    "story": [
      "Abortion policy could see more changes across the U.S. as President-elect Donald Trump begins his second term and state legislative sessions get rolling",
      "An incoming new president and state legislative sessions ramping up are likely to bring more changes to abortion policy across the U.S., which is still settling after the seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans.",
      "State lawmakers across the country have introduced at least 400 abortion-related bills so far.",
      "On Monday, President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn in for a second term. His positions on abortion have sometimes been inconsistent. But no matter where he lands on some issues, his administration will be a contrast with President Joe Biden, who has favored abortion rights at every turn.",
      "Here is a look at the latest developments.",
      "Most U.S. abortions are now performed with medication rather than surgical procedures and much of the anti-abortion effort is aimed at limiting access to those pills. A lawsuit seeking to restrict access to mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used together for medication abortions, picked up some steam this week.",
      "A federal judge on Thursday ruled Idaho, Kansas and Missouri can revive an attempt to roll back the federal approval of mifepristone, making it harder to get.",
      "The states want it to be allowed only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy, rather than the current 10, and to require three in-person doctor\u2019s visits, eliminating telehealth prescriptions. The states argue that efforts to provide access to the pills \u201cundermine state abortion laws and frustrate state law enforcement,\u201d according to court documents.",
      "The Supreme Court rejected a similar effort last year, saying anti-abortion doctors and their organizations did not have the legal standing to challenge the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approvals.",
      "Abortion rights advocates worry Trump's administration could start enforcing the Comstock Act, a 19th century law barring materials used in abortions from being mailed, which hasn\u2019t been enforced for close to 100 years.",
      "While Trump has said he doesn\u2019t plan to restrict medication abortion, he also said \u201cthings change,\u201d leaving open the possibility.",
      "This month, New Jersey became the latest Democratic-controlled state to start stockpiling abortion pills. Other liberal-leaning states, including California and Massachusetts were already stockpiling them.",
      "An Indiana lawmaker has proposed criminalizing shipping the drugs to individuals in the state. Several other states already have similar laws, which are among the priorities for anti-abortion groups.",
      "Some blue states have laws intended to protect providers who use telehealth to prescribe pills and mail them to states with bans. The practice accounted for about one-tenth of abortions in the U.S. by June 2024, one study found.",
      "Voters in seven states approved ballot measures for constitutional amendments on reproductive freedom in November and more states could see ballot measures in coming years.",
      "Lawmakers in Hawaii and Virginia, where the legislature is controlled by Democrats, have proposed reproductive freedom amendments for 2026. The Virginia resolution passed the House of Delegates last week. But it needs approval from the Senate and then from both chambers again next year.",
      "Missouri was the only state with a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy to adopt an abortion-rights amendment in November. A judge invalidated the ban, but no clinic has opened as abortion rights advocates press courts undo other regulations that they say make it impossible to operate. Missouri lawmakers already are pushing measures to ask voters to roll back the abortion protections they adopted.",
      "Lawmakers in three states that now ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy are considering further restrictions.",
      "In Oklahoma, a GOP lawmaker is proposing a law that would allow women who obtain abortions to be charged with murder.",
      "A similar measure was introduced in South Carolina in 2023 but quickly stalled. The National Right to Life Committee, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and other anti-abortion groups oppose penalizing women who seek or obtain abortions.",
      "A measure introduced in Mississippi, which echoes laws adopted in the past two years in Idaho and Tennessee, criminalizes helping a minor obtain an abortion without the consent of a parent or guardian. A key difference: Mississippi\u2019s calls for penalties up to life in prison.",
      "The Tennessee law, which has been put on hold by a judge, has a maximum punishment of a year in prison while Idaho's law calls for up to five years.",
      "It is too early in legislative sessions to tell which measures could advance.",
      "Biden's administration sued Idaho over its abortion ban two years ago, arguing that under federal law it should not be enforced during life- and health-threatening emergencies.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled last year that such abortions can be provided while the issue works it way through the courts.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to abandon the lawsuit. St. Luke's Health System, Idaho's largest health care provider, this week sued the state over the same topic, which would have the effect of keeping litigation on the topic alive.",

      "Nearly eight years since its historic first march, the Women\u2019s March is returning to the nation's capital just before President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Eight years since its historic first march, the Women's March is returning Saturday to the nation's capital just before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.",
      "Rebranded and reorganized, the rally has a new name \u2014 the People's March \u2014 as a means to broaden support, especially during a reflective moment for progressive organizing after Trump's decisive win in November. The Republican takes the oath of office Monday.",
      "Women outraged over Trump's 2016 presidential win flocked to Washington in 2017 and organized large rallies in cities throughout the country, building the base of a grassroots movement that became known as the Women's March. The Washington rally alone attracted over 500,000 marchers, and millions more participated in local marches around the country, marking one of the largest single-day demonstrations in U.S. history.",
      "This year, the march is expected to be about one-tenth the size of the first one and comes amid a restrained moment of reflection as many progressive voters navigate feelings of exhaustion, disappointment and despair after Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 loss. The comparative quiet contrasts sharply with the white-knuckled fury of the inaugural rally as massive crowds shouted demands over megaphones and marched in pink pussyhats in response to Trump's first election win.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that it\u2019s just hard to capture lightning in a bottle,\" said Tamika Middleton, managing director at the Women\u2019s March. \u201cIt was a really particular moment. In 2017, we had not seen a Trump presidency and the kind of vitriol that that represented.\u201d",
      "The movement fractured after that hugely successful day of protests over accusations that it was not diverse enough. This year's rebrand as a People's March is the result of an overhaul intended to broaden the group's appeal. Saturday's demonstration will promote themes related to feminism, racial justice, anti-militarization and other issues and will end with discussions hosted by various social justice organizations.",
      "The People\u2019s March is unusual in the \u201cvast array of issues brought together under one umbrella,\u201d said Jo Reger, a sociology professor who researches social movements at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. Women\u2019s suffrage marches, for example, were focused on a specific goal of voting rights.",
      "For a broad-based social justice movement such as the march, conflicting visions are impossible to avoid and there is \u201cimmense pressure\u201d for organizers to meet everyone\u2019s needs, Reger said. But she also said some discord isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.",
      "\u201cOften what it does is bring change and bring in new perspectives, especially of underrepresented voices,\u201d Reger said.",
      "Middleton, of the Women's March, said a massive demonstration like the one in 2017 is not the goal of Saturday's event. Instead, it\u2019s to focus attention on a broader set of issues \u2014 women\u2019s and reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, immigration, climate and democracy \u2014 rather than centering it more narrowly around Trump.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not thinking about the march as the endgame,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cHow do we get those folks who show up into organizations and into their political homes so they can keep fighting in their communities long term?\u201d"

      "The ritualistic changing of power will get underway as Washington\u2019s solemn pomp is paired with Trump\u2019s brand of party: a fireworks showcase at one of his luxury golf properties, guests including tech industry titans, friends from the business world and conservative media stars, and thousands of his supporters streaming in from around the country.",
      "With a blast of Arctic air expected to leave the nation\u2019s capital facing frigid temperatures on Inauguration Day, organizers were also scrambling to move inside most of Monday\u2019s outdoor events, including the swearing-in ceremony.",
      "Trump, a Republican, left office in 2021 as a political pariah after his refusal to accept his loss led a mob to overrun the U.S. Capitol. He then broke tradition by skipping Democrat Joe Biden's inauguration as his successor.",
      "In a stark contrast with Trump, Biden will adhere to one of the most potent symbols of the democratic handover, welcoming Trump to the White House and joining him on the ride to the Capitol before he takes the oath of office.",
      "The first time Trump was sworn into office eight years ago, the former reality TV star billionaire came in as an outsider disrupting Washington\u2019s norms, delivering a dark inaugural address as his swearing-in drew large protests and some clashes in the street.",
      "This time, the protests are expected to be far less noticeable, eclipsed by the ceremonies and celebrations around Trump\u2019s taking power. As one more marker of Trump's remarkable comeback, the events surrounding his inauguration will be more celebrity-studded than the last time, along with a noticeable turnout by a cadre of tech-world billionaires.",
      "Country music stars Carrie Underwood, Billy Ray Cyrus and Jason Aldean, disco band the Village People, rapper Nelly and musician Kid Rock are all scheduled to perform at inauguration-related ceremonies and events. Actor Jon Voight and wrestler Hulk Hogan are also expected to make appearances, as are a crew of Trump-embracing business executives: Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.",
      "The pageantry begins Saturday, when the president-elect leaves his Florida home to head to Washington. Trump\u2019s advisers have not detailed how he will spend the first part of the day, and the only public event on Trump\u2019s schedule is an evening reception and fireworks show at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, outside the city.",
      "While Trump holds court at his club, Vice President-elect JD Vance will attend a reception for Cabinet members and host a dinner in Washington.",
      "On Sunday, the eve of his inauguration, Trump is scheduled to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery before heading to a rally at Capital One Arena in Washington. The rally will be followed by a private dinner.",
      "On Inauguration Day, Trump will start with the traditional prayer service at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church before heading to the White House for a customary tea with the outgoing president and first lady.",
      "Trump then heads to the Capitol, where his ceremony has been moved indoors as temperatures are set to plummet and make it the coldest Inauguration Day in 40 years. It\u2019s not quite clear how the ceremony will be adapted to the Capitol Rotunda, but only a fraction of the original crowd will be allowed in.",
      "Eight years ago, Trump\u2019s critics were wrestling with whether to attend his inauguration, contemplating whether to buck long-standing practice and send a signal to the divisive new president. This year, much outspoken resistance to Trump has faded away, though there will be two notable absences: former first lady Michelle Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Neither gave an explanation as to why she was skipping the ceremony.",
      "After Trump takes the oath of office and delivers his inaugural address, there will be a ceremonial farewell to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As the new Republican government takes power, Trump will head to a signing ceremony at the Capitol to approve some of his first official acts, followed by a congressional luncheon and review of U.S. troops.",
      "The planned traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue has morphed into an indoor event because of the cold, with Trump again planning to speak to his gathered supporters before he heads to the White House for a signing ceremony in the Oval Office. A trio of glitzy balls will follow in the evening, punctuated by musical performances.",
      "Trump\u2019s arrival in Washington will once again be accompanied by protests and vigils on issues such as abortion, immigration rights and, this time, the Israel-Hamas war, but the feel and the force of those demonstrations are expected to be different from the outset of his first term.",
      "The Women\u2019s March, spurred by women outraged over Trump\u2019s win in 2017, drew more than 500,000 people to Washington and millions more in cities around the country, marking one of the largest single-day demonstrations in U.S. history.",
      "The march is returning Saturday, rebranded as the People\u2019s March, with organizers saying their focus will be less on Trump and more on broader goals around women\u2019s and reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, immigration, climate and democracy. It is expected to draw about 50,000 people, far fewer than eight years ago."

      "Resettlement agencies have raced to welcome refugees before President-elect Donald Trump takes office",
      "NEW MILFORD, Conn. -- Rogers Lopez knows just how lucky his family is as they settle into their furnished two-bedroom apartment in suburban Connecticut, just before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Lopez, his wife Karina Ca\u00f1izarez and their 5-year-old son Jesus are refugees from Venezuela and Colombia who were embraced by a team of supportive volunteers when they arrived in December. Similar encounters happened nationwide as resettlement groups scrambled in the final days of President Joe Biden's administration to find homes for refugees before Trump sharply limits, if not closes, this path to safety and citizenship.",
      "\u201cAlways, the refugee process is very difficult,\u201d said Lopez, 29, who said \"political problems\" forced him from Venezuela. \u201cBut it will be more difficult in the future.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program has brought in more than 3 million people since Congress created it in 1980 for refugees fearing persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinion.",
      "Trump, who put tight limits on refugees in his first term, has vowed to \u201csuspend refugee resettlement\u201d as part of a broader effort to \u201cimmediately end the migrant invasion of America.\u201d",
      "Presidents set targets and Biden ramped them up, citing \u201cthe generosity that has always been at the core of the American spirit,\u201d and the billions of dollars refugees have contributed to the U.S. economy.",
      "Nearly 30,000 refugees arrived during the final three months of 2024, coming close to meeting Biden's annual cap of 125,000. Trump admitted about 11,000 during the final year of his first term, the fewest since the U.S. began resettlements.",
      "\u201cPeople are desperate to do the work right now because we have a pretty good idea that all immigration is going to cease, at least for a while, when he takes office,\u201d said Michele Shackelford, president of the New Milford Refugee Resettlement group that's helping Lopez and his family.",
      "Often conflated with asylum-seekers who come directly to the U.S.-Mexico border, these refugees face a much more rigorous process. If the U.N. refugee agency determines they qualify, they are interviewed by U.S. immigration officials and must pass criminal background checks and medical screening. It can take years.",
      "Aware that Trump can close the doors almost immediately, Maria Mostajo, a former Manhattan prosecutor, and Carolyn Setlow, a retired business executive, have been working furiously to settle families in Connecticut through a project they founded in their small town of Washington.",
      "\u201cIf Trump comes in and either puts the kibosh on these entries or, as he\u2019s done in the past, reduces the number of people that can enter per year, then that basically means all these people that are in the pipeline, fewer and fewer of them are actually going to get in,\u201d Mostajo said.",
      "During the fall of the U.S.-supported government in Afghanistan, Mostajo and Setlow held a community meeting, appealing for volunteers and funds to help settle one Afghan family of six. Through various fundraising efforts, including a GoFundMe campaign and a party donated by a local distillery, they raised $80,000, as well as donations of furniture, and clothing, free legal help, English tutoring and other assistance.",
      "She and Setlow realized that their Washington Resettlement Project could leverage support for more refugees by providing grants of up to $10,000 to other volunteers. Since the election, they have awarded grants to the New Milford group and three others, with two more in the pipeline, Mostajo said.",
      "After Trump's victory, global charities such as Church World Service urged volunteers across the U.S. to quickly create more private sponsorship groups as part of Welcome Corps, a U.S. State Department initiative launched in 2023 to encourage teams of citizens to take responsibility for incoming refugees. Groups need to raise a minimum of $2,425 per refugee to cover their initial 90 days of living expenses.",
      "Larger resettlement organizations make the matches. For Connecticut, federal officials told Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services in New Haven to expect about 130 arrivals between late November and January.

    "story": [
      "A former Georgia prosecutor is heading to court as a criminal defendant, charged with interfering with police investigating the 2020 killing of Ahmaud Arbery",
      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Barely an hour after his son killed Ahmaud Arbery with a shotgun after they chased him through their neighborhood, Greg McMichael made a call for help to his former boss, the area's chief state prosecutor.",
      "\u201cMy son and I have been involved in a shooting, and I need some advice right away,\u201d McMichael said in a voicemail left on District Attorney Jackie Johnson's cellphone.",
      "A video of the killing would ultimately lead to charges against McMichael, his adult son Travis McMichael and their neighbor William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan. All three white men, who used pickup trucks and guns to try to corral the 25-year-old Black man, are now serving life sentences for murder and federal hate crimes.",
      "But all three men avoided arrest for more than two months as Greg McMichael and Johnson kept in touch by phone, court records show.",
      "Nearly five years later, Johnson is going to trial on charges that she used her office to interfere with police investigating Arbery\u2019s killing. Jury selection is scheduled to start Tuesday in Brunswick, a port city 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of Savannah.",
      "Here are key things to know about the case.",
      "Arbery was a frequent runner and his route often included the Satilla Shores subdivision where he was killed in coastal Glynn County, less than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from his home.",
      "When Arbery ran past the McMichaels' property on Sept. 23, 2020, the father and son grabbed guns and gave chase. Bryan joined them in his own truck and was recording cellphone video when the McMichaels stopped in the road ahead of Arbery, who tried to run around them. The video showed Travis McMichael shooting Arbery at point-blank range as they grappled over his shotgun.",
      "Police found Arbery was unarmed and carried no stolen property, but they let the men go home. The incident report quoted Greg McMichael saying they suspected Arbery had been stealing from a neighboring home under construction and that his son fired his gun in self-defense.",
      "Two months later, Bryan's video leaked online, triggering outrage as Arbery's death became part of a broader outcry over racial injustice that followed the 2020 police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky.",
      "The Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police. The McMichaels were quickly arrested, as was Bryan two weeks later.",
      "At the time Arbery was killed, Johnson had served for a decade as district attorney for southeast Georgia's Brunswick Judicial Circuit. Greg McMichael worked in her office as an investigator before retiring in 2019.",
      "Because of that connection, Johnson has said she immediately recused her office from handling the case. A neighboring district attorney, George Barnhill, became the first of three outside prosecutors appointed to take over. He soon concluded the McMichaels were legally attempting to detain Arbery and that the shooting was justified.",
      "Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr ordered an investigation of the two prosecutors in May 2020 soon after the McMichaels were arrested. Carr said he appointed Barnhill based on Johnson's recommendation, but wasn't told Barnhill already had advised police that Arbery's killing wasn't a crime.",
      "When voters ousted Johnson in the November 2020 election, she largely blamed the controversy surrounding Arbery's killing and insisted she had done nothing wrong.",
      "The former prosecutor became a criminal defendant when a grand jury indicted Johnson on Sept. 2, 2021. Carr announced his office was prosecuting the case.",
      "Johnson is charged with violating her oath of office, a felony punishable by one to five years in prison, by using her position to show \u201cfavor and affection\u201d to Greg McMichael.",
      "The indictment also charges her with a misdemeanor \u2014 hindering police investigating the shooting \u2014 by \"directing that Travis McMichael should not be placed under arrest.\u201d",
      "Johnson told The Associated Press in 2020 that no one in her office told police not to make arrests. Her lead defense attorney, Brian Steel, said during a December pretrial hearing that Johnson was focused on seeking an unrelated high-profile indictment and \u201cdidn\u2019t know what was going on with Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s case.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors haven't disclosed much of their trial evidence, but said in court records that 16 calls were made between cellphone numbers for Greg McMichael and Johnson in the weeks following the shooting.",
      "Jury duty notices were mailed to 500 county residents, which is more than normal, to facilitate selecting an impartial jury, Glynn County Superior Court Clerk Rebecca Walden said.",
      "Potential jurors reporting to the courthouse Tuesday morning will be questioned about what they have read or heard about the case. Walden said she suspects it could take a week or more to arrive at a final jury of 12 members plus alternates.",
      "Johnson's case has taken three years and four months to go to trial.",
      "Presiding will be Senior Judge John R. Turner, who told the AP in October that the long wait was unavoidable because Steel, Johnson's lead attorney, spent nearly two years in an Atlanta courtroom defending Grammy-winning rapper Young Thug in a prolonged racketeering and gang trial.",
      "Five days after the rapper agreed to a plea deal in Oct. 31, Turner ordered Johnson to make her first court appearance and scheduled her January trial."

      "The U.N., created in the aftermath of the World War II Holocaust in 6 six million Jews were killed, has worked to counter antisemitism.",
      "But the 193-member global organization has been accused of being antisemitic, including by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for U.N. ambassador, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik.

      "The U.N. Action Plan to Enhance Monitoring and Response to Antisemitism is mainly focused on strengthening and coordinating work throughout the United Nations, but it also includes recommendations for governments and organizations.",
      "Miguel Moratinos, the head of the U.N. Alliance of Civilizations, which developed the plan, said he was alarmed at the surge in antisemitic incidents online and offline, citing attacks on synagogues and religious sites, including after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas and other militants in southern Israel, which resulted in the worst killing of Jews since the Holocaust and set off the war in Gaza.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, our efforts, like those of national governments, have not been sufficient to curb the drivers of antisemitism,\u201d he said.",
      "Moratinos said new actors involved in social transformations in technology, science and the economy must be mobilized \u201cto address online and offline hate speech while upholding human rights.\u201d",

      "Outside the U.N., the plan encourages governments and organizations to denounce antisemitism swiftly and enhance education about the Holocaust and antisemitism. It also encourages \u201czero tolerance policies\u201d for antisemitism.",
      "Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, the U.S. special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a joint statement, \u201cThe challenge now lies in putting the plan into practice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe U.N. must demonstrate its full commitment to its human rights mandate and take concrete steps that will lead to tangible progress,\u201d the outgoing ambassadors said."

      "Driscoll was the day supervisor in the AP's Chicago bureau in the late 1970s and early 1980s when the bureau didn't have a news editor.

      "The oldest daughter's testimony wrapped the first week in the trial of Jeanne Kay Whitefeather and Donald Ray Lantz, who are accused of mistreating their five adopted children, all of whom are Black. Whitefeather and Lantz, who are white, each face more than a dozen felony counts that include forced labor, civil rights violations, human trafficking and gross child neglect.",

      "The children were made to stand in their rooms for hours \u201cto prevent us from falling asleep,\u201d she testified. They also were told to keep their hands on their heads, and Whitefeather would often use pepper spray on them if they didn't, the teenager said.",
      "\u201cIt would be the entire day, then go to sleep and do it again the next day,\u201d she said.",
      "During her testimony, the teenager described photos shown of the home in which she said Lantz yelled at one of the children for not listening and hit the boy on the head with a PVC pipe.",

      "The teenager said the children were given a diet of peanut butter sandwiches at scheduled feedings, some that were left over from a previous meal. The children were not allowed to eat at other times if they were hungry and only were allowed to drink water after they finished their meals.",
      "The daughter used a sleeping bag on the floor, while her teenage brother slept on the bare floor with only a piece of cardboard to use as a pillow. The children rarely bathed. The teen said she went about two months without showering or brushing her teeth.",
      "She also said she wasn't provided menstrual products, even though she asked Whitefeather for them.",
      "Lantz dropped off food to the children in their rooms and handled their daily chores, which included carrying supplies, gardening, digging holes for trees, clearing land, gathering water from a creek and looking after the animals on their farm. The teenager said some of the children were forced to use their hands for digging the holes.",
      "The teen said the outdoor work occurred mostly on a farm in Washington. Those tasks stopped in West Virginia when neighbors observed the children standing in line or performing hard labor. The children mostly stayed indoors afterward.",

      "Attorneys in the case have said the oldest boy had attempted to run away from home and that the lock on the shed was aimed at keeping him from trying it again. A video surveillance system was installed \u201cbecause Jeanne said she didn't trust us,\u201d the daughter testified. \u201cShe told us to stop being stupid.\u201d",

      "A federal appeals court has ruled against an Obama-era policy shielding hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have long lived in the United States from deportation",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- A federal appeals court on Friday ruled against an Obama-era policy to shield immigrants who came to the country illegally as young children, only three days before Donald Trump takes office with pledges of mass deportations.",
      "The unanimous decision by a panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans \u2014 two judges appointed by Republican presidents, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, and one by Democrat Barack Obama \u2014 is the latest blow for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, whose beneficiaries have lived in legal limbo for more than a decade.",
      "It signals no immediate change for its more than 500,000 beneficiaries, who can renew temporary permits to live and work in the United States. But the federal government cannot take new applications, leaving an aging and thinning pool of recipients.",
      "The decision may tee up the policy for a third visit to the Supreme Court. Trump sought to end DACA during his first term, but he also occasionally expressed wishes that beneficiaries be allowed to stay.",
      "Obama introduced DACA in 2012, citing inaction by Congress on legislation aimed at giving those brought to the U.S. as children a path to legal status. Legal battles followed, including two trips to the Supreme Court.",
      "This latest case involves a new version of the rule issued by President Joe Biden in 2022. It represented little substantive change from the 2012 memo that created DACA, but it was subject to public comment as part of a formal rule-making process intended to improve its chances of surviving legal muster.",

      "NEW YORK -- A bull moose that fell through lake ice in the Adirondack Mountains was saved by New York conservation officials in a laborious cold-water rescue.",
      "The moose fell through the ice around 11 a.m. Thursday, about 200 feet (60 meters) from shore on Lake Abanakee, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation announced in a statement Friday. That lake is near the town of Indian Lake, about 60 miles (40 kilometers) south of Lake Placid and west of the Vermont border.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not training manual for getting moose out of the ice,\u201d said Environmental Conservation Police officer, Lt. Robert Higgins, in a video statement recounting the event.",
      "Higgins was dispatched to the lake thanks to a passerby who saw the moose break through the ice and called it in. Higgins asked for backup, and was quickly joined by a pair of forest rangers.",
      "In New York, moose are sometimes poached by humans, and a handful die every year due to being hit by cars, according to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Across the U.S., these giant deer cousins face challenges from human-caused habitat loss and human-caused climate change that has led to warm summers and oppressive tick infestations, which can cause them to lose their fur.",
      "For this moose, the humans came to help. Moose can die from hypothermia, and they can't easily climb onto ice once they have fallen through into water. Ice rescues are dangerous because the rescuers can also fall through.",
      "\u201cWe were able use our ice rescue training to safely get out there,\u201d said Forest Ranger Evan Nahor, in the video statement.",
      "First they put on dry suits, so they would float and stay warm if they ended up in the water. Then they used a long metal \u201cspud bar\u201d to test the thickness of the ice, which varied from about one to four inches (2.5 to 10 centimeters). They brought safety ropes so that if one fell in, the others could pull them out.",
      "They navigated a path across the lake, following the thickest path to the moose without breaking through, and knelt on sleds to distribute their weight.",
      "The forest rangers used a chainsaw to cut away sections of ice connecting the area where the moose broke through to a thicker section of ice, while Higgins pushed the ice blocks underneath the channel, to get them out of the way.",
      "The hope was for the moose to swim down the channel and climb out. A bull moose can weigh around 1,000 pounds (455 kilograms), so there wasn\u2019t much chance of them being able to pull it out safely.",
      "The moose didn\u2019t swim toward the thick ice, so they tried to herd it down the channel they had cut. The bull moose wasn't intimidated by the officials or their big metal sticks.",
      "It was intimidated by their sleds.",
      "\u201cFor whatever reason it was scared of those. So once we got behind it, we were able to direct it,\" said Matt Savarie, the other forest ranger.",
      "The giant moose quickly crawled onto the ice, but the cold and constant treading water \u2014 the ordeal lasted around 2 hours \u2014 had taken its toll.",
      "\u201cIt was really tired. I was shivering. It didn't have much energy left,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cWe didn't know if was going to be able to stand up or not.\u201d",
      "After 15 minutes, it found its footing and got up.",
      "\u201cIt was just an amazing sight to see that huge moose stand up right in front of us,\" he said.",
      "Then it walked off into the woods.",

      "The Sixth District Court of Appeal vacated Stubblefield's conviction in December 2024 and overturned his sentence of 15 years to life in prison after finding that racial bias had tainted the Black man's trial. But the appellate court's remittitur, a technical ruling that returns jurisdiction to the lower court, is not expected to be issued until next month, the news outlet reported.",
      "Stubblefield's attorneys have sought his release, asserting there are no longer grounds to keep him incarcerated.",
      "In a motion filed to Ramon earlier this week, the attorneys said the judge had the authority to transfer the ex-NFL player from California State Prison, Corcoran \u2014 where he has served close to four years of a 15-year sentence \u2014 to county jail, and then grant his release on bail. That would effectively return Stubblefield to the same status that he had pretrial, which they argue is his current legal standing, the news outlet reported.",
      "In court Friday, Ramon maintained jurisdiction isn't returned to the local court until the Court of Appeal issues the remittitur. Deputy District Attorney Tim McInerney's office has stated it supports Stubblefield remaining in custody, according to The Mercury News.",
      "Outside the courthouse, Stubblefield's attorneys opposed the decision.",
      "\u201cAs he sits here, everything has been vacated, he has been convicted of nothing, and a legally innocent man is sitting in prison because we\u2019re waiting on a time clock,\u201d attorney Ken Rosenfeld said.",
      "The retired football player was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison in October 2020 after being convicted of raping a developmentally disabled woman whom prosecutors said he lured to his home in 2015 with the promise of a babysitting job. Defense attorneys said no rape occurred, and Stubblefield said the woman consented to sex in exchange for money.",
      "In December 2024, the Sixth Court of Appeal found that prosecutors violated the California Racial Justice Act of 2020, a law passed during a summer of protest over the police killing of George Floyd. The measure bars prosecutors from seeking a criminal conviction or imposing a sentence on the basis of race.",
      "The appeals court said prosecutors used \u201cracially discriminatory language\u201d that required them to overturn Stubblefield\u2019s conviction.",
      "Stubblefield began his 11-year lineman career in the NFL with the 49ers in 1993 as the league\u2019s defensive rookie of the year. He later won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 1997 before leaving the team to play for Washington. He returned to the Bay Area to finish his career, playing with the 49ers in 2000-01 and the Raiders in 2003."

      "The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions for Americans over the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids",
      "DEERFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions in the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids, according to a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",
      "Walgreens, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 locations, said in a statement that it stands behind its pharmacists. It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- A South Carolina man pleaded guilty Friday to charges that he gunned down a New Mexico state police officer who had stopped to help him, marking a turning point in a case that had been set for trial later this year.",
      "Jaremy Smith entered the new plea during a hearing Friday in U.S. district court in Albuquerque as part of an agreement reached with federal prosecutors. Smith will face a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Sentencing has yet to be scheduled.",
      "Dozens of state police officers packed the courtroom during the hearing and later gathered on the steps outside. They were joined by top state and federal law enforcement officials and the parents of the fallen officer.",
      "\u201cI just want to say that I\u2019m glad this sorry excuse of a human being owned up to what he did. It\u2019s been 10 long months to get to this point,\u201d said Jim Hare, the father of State Police Officer Justin Hare.",
      "Smith had pleaded not guilty last year to several charges that included kidnapping resulting in a death; carjacking resulting in a death; using a firearm during the commission of violent crime; and possession of a stolen firearm. A charge related to driving a stolen vehicle across state lines was dropped as part of the agreement.",
      "He also is charged in South Carolina in the killing of a paramedic there whose stolen car was involved in the officer\u2019s killing in New Mexico.",
      "New Mexico Public Safety Secretary Jason Bowie said after the court hearing that his department and state police officers will continue to stand with Hare's family throughout the sentencing process. He also lamented that New Mexico's current statutes fall short of federal punishments for violent crimes like killing a police officer and that state leaders need to do more to hold repeat offenders accountable.",
      "Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has hosted some community meetings ahead of the legislative session. Bowie said those gatherings made clear that people don't feel safe.",
      "\u201cI think every community is fed up with it,\u201d Bowie said, confirming that public safety will be among the top priorities during the legislative session that starts Tuesday.",
      "The fatal shooting of Officer Justin Hare happened before dawn on March 15, 2024, along Interstate 40 near the community of Tucumcari. The killing set off a search for Smith, who was wounded and captured two days later in Albuquerque after authorities got a tip from a gas station clerk.",
      "According to a criminal complaint, Hare had been dispatched to help a motorist in a white BMW. After parking behind the BMW, a man approached his patrol car on the passenger side. The two then began talking about a flat tire, and the officer offered Smith a ride to a nearby town because no repair shop was open at that hour.",
      "Seconds later, Smith shot Hare and then went to the driver\u2019s side and waited until traffic passed to shoot the officer again, according to dash camera video that was released as part of the investigation.",
      "Authorities said Smith then pushed the officer into the passenger seat and drove away. The duress signal on the officer\u2019s radio was triggered and other officers responded.",
      "Hare was found about an hour later, alive but fatally injured on the side of a frontage road. The 35-year-old father had been with the state police agency since 2018.",
      "State Police later learned the BMW had been reported missing in South Carolina and belonged to a woman who was killed there \u2014 Phonesia Machado-Fore, 52, a Marion County paramedic. Her body was found outside Lake View in neighboring Dillon County.",
      "While U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland opted not to pursue the death penalty against Smith, it could be on the table with the pending state case in South Carolina, said Alexander M.M. Uballez, the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico."

      "Some wounds suffered by six Hawaii residents flown to Arizona for medical treatment after a deadly illegal fireworks explosion on New Year\u2019s are comparable to battlefield injuries",
      "HONOLULU -- Some wounds suffered by six Hawaii residents flown to Arizona for medical treatment after a deadly illegal fireworks explosion on New Year's are comparable to battlefield injuries, the doctor overseeing their care said Friday.",
      "Dr. Kevin Foster, the director of the Arizona Burn Center in Phoenix, said flying particles and debris from the explosion inflicted traumatic injuries.",
      "\u201cIn addition to the thermal injury that comes from the heat and the flame and the fire, we also have an explosive nature to this with particles moving at very high speeds striking patients,\u201d Foster said at a news conference from Phoenix that was streamed online.",
      "The blast killed four people, including a 3-year-old boy, and injured about 20 others. The U.S. military flew six of the wounded to Arizona on Jan. 4 because Hawaii\u2019s lone burn unit didn't have enough capacity to care for all the victims.",
      "Medical staff hadn't realized the magnitude of the injuries from the flying particles until the patients had surgery. But Foster said this was to be expected.",
      "\u201cYou really have to get into the operating room and start operating on these people to really understand that. So it\u2019s not surprising that nobody picked up on this,\u201d Foster said.",
      "The traumatic injuries resulted in some unusual infections but Foster said this didn\u2019t catch caregivers off guard. Doctors at the center have seen these types of injuries in fireworks patients before and infections in burn patients are almost unavoidable, he said.",
      "The blast happened at a three-story home with a bottom-level carport in a Honolulu residential neighborhood.",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green earlier this week proposed a range of new penalties to crack down on those who flout the state\u2019s fireworks laws. The state Department of Law Enforcement has asked the Legislature for $5.2 million to hire eight people and expand a forensic lab to counter rampant smuggling of illegal fireworks."

    "story": [
      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its growth forecast for the UK economy this year, but has also warned about the possible impact of Donald Trump's economic plans.",
      "The global institution upgraded its prediction for UK growth to 1.6% for this year from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "But it said a threatened wave of tariffs by incoming US president Trump could make trade tensions worse, lower investment, and disrupt supply chains across the world.",
      "The IMF also said although tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation could boost the US economy in the short term, they could ultimately backfire.",
      "The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because they will make it more expensive for companies to sell their goods in the world's biggest economy.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue - and has threatened to issue tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico on day one of his presidency next week.",
      "He has also said he would impose 100% tariffs on the BRICS bloc of nine nations if they were to create a rival currency to the US dollar.",
      "The IMF said such policies could set the scene for an inflationary boom followed by a bust and could weaken US Treasury bonds as a safe bet.",
      "As well as upgrading its outlook for the UK, the IMF suggested the UK economy would perform better than European economies such as Germany, France and Italy over the next two years.",
      "The improved forecast could be a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has faced pressure over her policy decisions this week, after figures showed the economy had flatlined.",
      "Labour has made growth its key objective, but Reeves has admitted the government has to \"do more to grow our economy\", in order to boost living standards.",
      "The latest IMF figures suggested the UK economy had weaker growth last year than the organisation had expected.",
      "Responding to the IMF's report, Reeves highlighted that the UK was the only G7 economy, apart from the US, to have its growth forecast upgraded for 2025.",
      "Forecasts are never perfect given the many factors that affect economic growth - from geopolitics to the weather. But such reports can point in the right direction, especially where they align with other predictions.",
      "Global growth forecast to flatline as tariffs add to strains",
      "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
      "The IMF predicted \"stable, albeit lacklustre\" global growth of 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026, below a historical average of 3.7%.",
      "Its 2025 forecast was largely unchanged from a previous one, mainly because it expects higher US growth than previously predicted to offset lower growth in other major economies.",
      "The imminent arrival of Trump in the White House dominates the section on risks in the IMF's twice-yearly forecast for the world economy.",
      "When he was last in power, Trump launched into a trade war with China, and US policy led to tit-for-tat tariffs with the EU.",
      "This time round, Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on global imports, a 25% duty on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "It warns that an inflationary US boom could be followed by a possible bust that would potentially \"weaken the role of US Treasuries as the global safe asset\".",
      "Investors see US Treasury securities as one of the safest possible bets, because the bonds - which are kind of like an IOU -  are backed by the US government.",
      "In addition, if red tape on business is cut too much, this could lead to a runaway dollar that could suck money out of emerging economies, depressing global growth.",
      "Trump going ahead with deportations of illegal immigrants could \"permanently reduce potential output\" and also raise inflation, The IMF said.",
      "Its chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said \"tremendous uncertainty\" about Trump's future policies was already affecting stock markets around the world.",
      "On Thursday, the World Bank also warned that US tariffs could hit trade and depress global growth this year.",
      "The bank predicts global growth of 2.7% in 2025, which would be the weakest performance since 2019, aside from the sharp contraction seen at the height of the Covid pandemic."

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the chancellor and business secretary wrote to the UK's main regulators in December asking them to come up with ideas for reform that could boost economic growth.",
      "They gave a deadline of mid-January. In its response, published on Friday, the FCA outlined various programmes underway as part of its aim to boost growth.",
      "But two new ideas are among others mooted, looking at mortgages and contactless payments.",
      "Strict rules mean lenders have to be sure that people can repay mortgages, testing them for higher rates of interest.",
      "Other rules were also imposed on mortgage providers after the financial crisis almost 20 years ago exposed reckless lending and put major financial institutions at risk.",
      "The FCA points to current low numbers of borrowers missing repayments, or having homes repossessed, as evidence of questioning whether the rules are too strict.",
      "\"We will begin simplifying responsible lending and advice rules for mortgages, supporting home ownership and opening a discussion on the balance between access to lending and levels of defaults,\" the letter by FCA chief executive, Nikhil Rathi said.",
      "It will consider the balance between its primary objective of protecting consumers, and a secondary objective of promoting growth.",
      "If you can't see the calculator, click here.",
      "Same mistakes?",
      "Lenders have welcomed the move, but some analysts and borrowers may question whether lessons have been learnt from the crisis.",
      "Charles Roe, director of mortgages at UK Finance, which represents lenders, said: \"Reviewing the mortgage lending rules would help with affordability issues, not just for first time buyers but also those looking to move further up the housing ladder.",
      "\"Banks will always lend responsibly but the current rules are restricting the number of people who can get a mortgage and so could be relaxed.\"",
      "Analysts said the move could prove to be more beneficial in certain parts of the country.",
      "\"The big question is whether current rules go too far but there is a risk for consumers and the government in how far this might go,\" said Richard Donnell, executive director of research at Zoopla.",
      "\"Finding the balance not easy and is compounded by the huge north-south divide in affordability.\"",
      "Contactless limits",
      "The FCA's second new idea is to scrap the \u00a3100 limit on contactless cards, to make it easier to spend.",
      "When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at \u00a310. Cards were generally used in this way in place of small change when buying snacks, papers and occasional groceries.",
      "The limit was raised gradually, to \u00a320 in 2012, then to \u00a330 in 2015, before going up to \u00a3100 in October 2021.",
      "Both ideas would be designed to encourage spending but could also be inflationary.  They would need to go through reviews and consultation, so are unlikely to be imminent changes, even if approved.",
      "The letter also outlines potential digital advances, such as requiring firms to accept electronic verification of death to speed up bereavement claims in insurance."

    "summary": "AI can take a second look at medical scans and flag up potential problems that doctors might not see.",
    "story": [
      "This is the sixth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "When 58-year-old Will Studholme ended up in accident and emergency at an NHS hospital in Oxford in 2023 with gastrointestinal symptoms, he wasn't expecting a diagnosis of osteoporosis.",
      "The disease, strongly associated with age, causes bones to become weak and fragile, increasing the risk of fracture.",
      "It turned out that Mr Studholme had a severe case of food poisoning, but early in his ailment's investigation, he received an abdominal CT scan.",
      "That scan was then later run through artificial intelligence (AI) technology which identified a collapsed vertebra in Mr Studholme's spine, a common early indicator of osteoporosis.",
      "Further testing ensued, and Mr Studholme emerged not only with his diagnosis, but a simple treatment: an annual infusion of an osteoporosis drug that is expected to improve his bone density.",
      "\"I feel very lucky,\" says Mr Studholme, \"I don't think this would have been picked up without the AI technology.\"",
      "It isn't unheard of that a radiologist might note something incidental in a patient's imaging \u2013 an undetected tumour, a concern with a particular tissue or organ \u2013 outside of what they had originally been checking for.",
      "But applying AI in the background to systematically comb through scans and automatically identify early signs of common preventable chronic diseases that might be brewing \u2013 regardless of the reason the scan was originally ordered \u2013 is new.",
      "The clinical use of AI for opportunistic screening or opportunistic imaging, as it is called, \"is just beginning\" notes Perry Pickhardt, a professor of radiology and medical physics at the University of Winconsin-Madison, who is among those developing the algorithms.",
      "It is considered opportunistic because it takes advantage of imaging that has already been done for another clinical purpose \u2013 be it suspected cancer, chest infection, appendicitis or belly pain.",
      "It has the potential to catch previously undiagnosed diseases in the early stages, before onset of symptoms, when they are easier to treat or prevent from progressing. \"We can avoid a lot of the lack of prevention that we have missed out on previously,\" says Prof Pickhardt.",
      "Regular physicals or blood tests often fail to pick up these diseases, he adds.",
      "There's a lot of data in CT scans related to body tissues and organs that we don't really use, notes Miriam Bredella, a radiologist at NYU Langone who is also developing algorithms in the field.",
      "And while analysis of it could theoretically be done without AI by radiologists making measurements \u2013 it would be time consuming.",
      "There are also benefits of the technology in terms of reducing bias, she notes.",
      "A disease like osteoporosis, for example, is thought of as mostly affecting thin, elderly white women \u2013 so doctors don't always think to look outside of that population.",
      "Opportunistic imaging, on the other hand, doesn't discriminate that way.",
      "Mr Studholme's case is a good example. Being relatively young for osteoporosis, male and with no history of broken bones, it is unlikely he would have been diagnosed without AI.",
      "In addition to osteoporosis, AI is being trained to help opportunistically identify heart disease, fatty liver disease, age-related muscle loss and diabetes.",
      "While the main focus is on CT scans, for example of the abdomen or chest, work is taking place to opportunistically glean information from other types of imaging too, including chest x-rays and mammograms.",
      "The algorithms are trained on many thousands of tagged previous scans, and it is important the training data includes scans from a wide swathe of ethnic groups if the technology is going to be deployed on a diverse range of people, stress the experts.",
      "And there is supposed to be a level of human review \u2013 if the AI finds something suspect it would be sent to radiologists to confirm before it is then reported on to doctors.",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Why 'digital twins' could speed up drug discovery",
      "The AI technology used to examine Mr Studholme's scan belongs to Israeli company Nanox.AI, which is one of only a handful of companies working on AI for opportunistic screening - far more are focused on using AI to assist in the accurate and swift diagnoses of the specific conditions the scans are actually conducted for.",
      "Nanox.AI offers three opportunistic screening products aimed at helping identify osteoporosis, heart disease and fatty liver disease respectively from routine CT scans.",
      "Oxford NHS hospitals began trialling Nanox.AI's osteoporosis focused product in 2018 before officially rolling it out in 2020.",
      "Results from Oxford hospitals show an up to six-fold increase above the NHS average in the number of patients being identified with vertebral fractures \u2013 patients that can then be checked for osteoporosis, and start treatment to combat the disease, says Kassim Javaid, a professor of osteoporosis and rare bone diseases at the University of Oxford who has spearheaded the algorithm's introduction.",
      "Further trials of the algorithm are also now underway at hospitals in Cambridge, Cardiff, Nottingham and Southampton. \"We want to build the evidence to use it across the NHS,\" says Prof Javaid.",
      "Yet while the technology can benefit individuals, there are wider ramifications that need to be considered says Sebastien Ourselin, a professor of healthcare engineering at Kings College London, who heads the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare.",
      "A big problem that needs to be balanced, he notes, is the extra patient numbers that the use of the technology can create. \"This is increasing the demand on the healthcare system not reducing it,\" he says.",
      "First, people who are flagged by the opportunistic screening as potentially having a disease will likely need further confirmatory testing, which takes resources. And, if the AI is inaccurate or too sensitive, that could result in a lot of unnecessary testing.",
      "Then services need to be in place for those extra people that do end up being diagnosed.",
      "The extra load is a challenge that comes with the technology admits Prof Javaid \u2013 but there are solutions.",
      "Patients confirmed to have the fractures in Oxford are routed for follow up to a largely nurse delivered fracture prevention service so as not to overload doctors. \"The AI does force you to change your pathway,\" he says.",
      "And in the long run, believes Prof Javaid, to have a greater number of people with early-stage osteoporosis identified and receiving the preventative treatment they need will save the NHS money. \"Fracture is one of the top reasons people end up in hospital,\" he says.",
      "Mr Studholme has seen the devastation of osteoporosis first hand: it led to his mother breaking both her hips. It used to just be considered an old person's condition with nothing that could be done, he says. \"I feel quite privileged I can do something before my bones turn into chalk,\" he says."

    "summary": "China's economy has hit the government's 5% growth target for 2024 in the face of multiple challenges.",
    "story": [
      "China's economy rebounded in the last three months of last year, allowing the government to meet its growth target of 5% in 2024, Beijing announced on Friday.",
      "But it is one of the slowest rates of growth in decades as the world's second largest economy struggles to shake off a protracted property crisis, high local government debt and youth unemployment.",
      "The head of the country's statistics bureau said China's economic achievements in 2024 were \"hard won,\" after the government launched a slew of stimulus measures late last year.",
      "Beijing has rarely missed its growth targets in the past.",
      "Experts had broadly predicted this rate of growth. The World Bank said lower borrowing costs and rising exports would mean China could achieve annual growth of 4.9%.",
      "Investors, however, are bracing themselves: the threat of President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs on $500bn (\u00a3409bn) worth of Chinese goods looms large.",
      "Yet that is not all that stands in the way of China achieving its growth targets next year.",
      "Business and consumer confidence is low, and the Chinese yuan will continue to weaken as Beijing cuts interest rates in a bid to boost growth.",
      "Here are three reasons why Xi has bigger challenges than Trump's tariffs:",
      "1. Tariffs are already hurting Chinese exports",
      "There is a growing chorus of warnings that China's economy will slow in 2025. One major driving factor of last year's growth is now at risk: exports.",
      "China has relied on manufacturing to help exit the slowdown - so, it has been exporting a record number of electric vehicles, 3D printers and industrial robots.",
      "The US, Canada and the European Union have accused China of making too many goods and imposed tariffs on Chinese imports to protect domestic jobs and businesses.",
      "Experts say Chinese exporters may now focus on other parts of the world. But those countries are likely to be in emerging markets, which don't have the same levels of demand as North America and Europe.",
      "That could impact Chinese businesses that are hoping to expand, in turn hitting suppliers of energy and raw materials.",
      "Xi wants to transform China from the world's factory for cheap goods into a high-tech powerhouse by 2035 but it's unclear how manufacturing can continue to be such a big growth driver in the face of rising tariffs.",
      "Who is China sending to Trump's inauguration?",
      "2. People are just not spending enough",
      "In China, household wealth is largely invested in the property market. Before the real estate crisis, it accounted for almost a third of China's economy - employing millions of people, from builders and developers to cement producers and interior designers.",
      "Beijing has implemented a slew of policies to stabilise the property market and the the financial markets watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), has said it will vigorously support reforms.",
      "But there are still too many empty homes and commercial properties, and that oversupply continues to force down prices.",
      "The property market slump is expected to bottom out this year, but Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs says the downturn will be a \"multi-year drag\" on China's economic growth.",
      "It's already hit spending hard - in the last three months of 2024, household consumption contributed just 29% to China's economic activity, down from 59% before the pandemic.",
      "That is one of the reasons Beijing has stepped up exports. It wants to help offset sluggish domestic spending on new cars, luxury items and almost everything else.",
      "The government has even introduced programmes like consumer goods trade-ins, where people can exchange their washing machines, microwaves and rice cookers.",
      "But experts wonder whether these kinds of measures alone are sufficient without addressing deeper issues in the economy.",
      "They say people will need more money in their pockets before pre-Covid levels for spending return.",
      "\"China needs to bring back the animal spirit of the population and we are still far from that,\" said Shuang Ding, Chief Economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Bank.",
      "\"If the private sector starts to invest and innovate that could increase income and the job outlook, and people will have more confidence to consume.\"",
      "Steep public debt and unemployment have also affected savings and spending.",
      "Official figures suggest the youth jobless rate remains high compared to before the pandemic, and that wage rises have stalled.",
      "3. Businesses are not flocking to China like they used to",
      "President Xi has promised to invest in the cutting-edge industries that the government calls \"new productive forces\".",
      "Until now, that has helped China become a leader in goods like renewable energy products such as solar panels and electric vehicle batteries.",
      "Last year, China also overtook Japan as the world's biggest car exporter.",
      "But the lacklustre economic picture, uncertainty over tariffs and other geopolitical uncertainties mean the appetite of foreign businesses for investment in China is subdued.",
      "It's not about foreign or domestic investment - it's that businesses don't see a bright future, said Stephanie Leung from wealth management platform StashAway.",
      "\"They would like to see a more diversified set of investors coming in.\"",
      "For all of these reasons, experts believe the measures to support the economy will only partially alleviate the impact of potential new US tariffs.",
      "Beijing must either undertake big, bold measures or accept that the economy is not going to grow so fast, Goldman Sachs' Chief China Economist Hui Shan wrote in a recent report, adding: \"We expect them to choose the former.\"",
      "\"China needs to stabilise property markets and create sufficient jobs to ensure social stability,\" Mr Ding from Standard Chartered Bank said.",
      "According to researcher China Dissent Monitor, there were more than 900 protests in China between June and September 2024 led by workers and property owners - 27% more than the same period a year earlier.",
      "These sort of social strains as a result of economic grievances and an erosion of wealth will be a concern for the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "After all, explosive growth turned China into a global power, and the promise of increased prosperity has largely helped its leaders keep a tight lid on dissent."

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The Nordic nation doesn't require staff to work long hours and has a generous welfare system.",
    "story": [
      "Gabriel Hoces repeats a word seven times when he discusses what it's like to work in Denmark - \"trust\".",
      "\"No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,\" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. \"Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects.",
      "\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"",
      "It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.",
      "Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.",
      "By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.",
      "Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.",
      "\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"",
      "Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.",
      "These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid annual leave per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.",
      "Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.",
      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",
      "By contrast, she says the US \"has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance\".",
      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",
      "\"More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 00:09:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Should more AI be used to help GPs with consultations and administrative work?",
    "story": [
      "This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Could AI help prevent diabetes-related sight loss?",
      "Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI.",
      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",
      "She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation.",
      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

    "summary": "Labour paused implementation of the act after taking power, due to concerns over student welfare.",
    "story": [
      "The government has confirmed plans to reintroduce a piece of legislation aimed at protecting free speech on university campuses.",
      "The Higher Education Freedom of Speech Act, which proposed fines for universities failing to uphold freedom of speech, was passed under the previous, Conservative government in 2023.",
      "But its implementation was stopped shortly after Labour's election win last summer over concerns the law was potentially damaging to student welfare.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told Parliament the government would be progressing with the legislation but with significant changes.",
      "The act said universities had a duty to \"secure\" and \"promote the importance\" of freedom of speech and academic expression.",
      "It included controversial new powers in which the regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), would have been able to fine or sanction higher education providers and student unions in England.",
      "A new complaints scheme for students, staff and visiting speakers was also included. They could seek compensation if they suffered from a breach of a university's free-speech obligations.",
      "However, last July the education secretary paused the law days before it was due to come into force, over fears it could protect people using hate speech on campuses and expose universities to expensive legal action.",
      "At the time, a government source told the BBC the legislation would have opened the way for Holocaust deniers to be allowed on campus, and was an \"antisemite charter\".",
      "Phillipson told Parliament in July that the delay would allow time to consider whether the law would be repealed.",
      "Having spent the last six months considering what to do, the act is now being brought back.",
      "Issuing fines",
      "In a statement, Phillipson said academic freedom was \"much more important than the wishes of some students not to be offended\".",
      "However, the government says it will seek to remove the part of the act that allows people to sue universities that fail to uphold their duty to protect freedom of speech.",
      "It could result in long and costly legal battles, at a time when many universities were already struggling financially, the government said.",
      "There will also no longer be direct responsibility on student unions under the law, though Phillipson said they would still be expected to support free speech and held to account by their university.",
      "The National Union of Students welcomed the announcement, saying the threat of complex legal responsibilities was no longer hanging over them.",
      "The OfS would retain powers to investigate alleged breaches of free speech under the law, the government said, as well as issuing fines.",
      "Shadow education secretary Laura Trott described the changes as a \"wrecking ball\" to the policy, and questioned what the consequences would be for universities alleged to have breached their free speech duties with the threat of legal action removed.",
      "'Inciting violence'",
      "But the government said it would provide a workable version of the act that would protect minority groups while defending freedom of speech on campuses.",
      "The Union of Jewish Students (UJS) welcomed the revised act, saying it \"takes into account the concerns raised by UJS and other parties\".",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 140 higher education providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day that academic freedom and freedom of speech were \"essential\" to universities and she was glad the legislation was coming back.",
      "But some of the original provisions in the act would \"gum up the works like you wouldn't believe\" for universities, she said.",
      "When the legislation was originally introduced, then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it would allow speakers to \"articulate views which others may disagree with as long as they don't meet the threshold of hate speech or inciting violence\".",
      "'Toothless tiger'",
      "Protests have taken place on university campuses in recent years, including before a talk by gender-critical academic Kathleen Stock at Oxford.",
      "There have also been cases of individuals being \"no-platformed\", where a controversial speaker is banned from an event.",
      "The education secretary said there had been too many such examples of freedom of speech not being upheld at universities and \"unacceptable\" cases like that of Prof Jo Phoenix, who was found by an employment tribunal to have been discriminated against and harassed at work because of her gender-critical beliefs.",
      "But Prof Phoenix told BBC News the revised version of the act was like a \"toothless tiger\" and the suppression of free speech still posed a \"real and visceral threat to the robustness of our universities\".",

      "But Mark's is an unusual workplace, to put it mildly.",
      "Employees at biotech conglomerate Lumon Industries are offered the company's pioneering severance programme, a concept inspired by series creator Dan Erickson's desire to escape the mind-numbing drudgery of his office jobs.",
      "Sold as the ultimate work-life balance, the firm's brain microchip procedure splits a person's consciousness and memory into dual existences.",
      "This means when \"severed\" grieving widower Mark Scout and his colleagues take the office lift each morning, their work-self - or \"innie\" - awakens for duty. Once they clock off, their \"outie\" re-emerges, returning to home life blissfully unaware.",
      "But series one's cliffhanger finale - the work of executive producer and director Ben Stiller - saw Mark discover his late wife Gemma may actually still be alive amid a rebellion by his team against their shadowy employers.",
      "The group managed to outsmart floor managers Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) and Milchick (Tramell Tillman) and override the severance system, briefly awakening their real-world bodies. Rebellious sceptic Helly (Britt Lowery) also learned a shattering truth about her outie's company ties.",
      "Fans have been waiting almost three years to find out what happens next, and on Friday, Severance returned to Apple TV for its anticipated second season.",
      "The show got critical acclaim in 2022 to become one of Apple's breakout hits - earning 14 Emmy nominations and a Writers Guild award. It helped, too, that the show arrived at a time when the pandemic had fundamentally shifted the audience's own relationship with office life.",
      "But the Hollywood writers' strike and behind-the scenes issues (resolved for Stiller to return to produce and direct), forced the wait that left audiences hungry for answers.",
      "I ask Scott, who, fittingly, has never worked a real office job but played many office on-screen roles, how that cliffhanger has affected his latest character's psyche on the show's return.",
      "\"Mark is far more self-possessed and septical, possibly, of this company,\" says the 51-year-old, who played manager Ben Wyatt in comedy Parks and Recreation.",
      "Last season, trapped inside Lumon's brutalist architecture and sanitised walls, crunching mysterious numbers for the \"Macrodata Refinement team\", the team was fed cultish Soviet-esque propaganda about company founder Kier Eagan and his family.",
      "Where previously, \"Lumon and Kier and all of its rules and and regulations made up [the innies'] identities\", Scott says their brief escape into the outside world and the chance to taste their alternate existences has \"filled them up\".",
      "Rebel, rebel",
      "If season one darkly satirised corporate greed and rebellion, season two lays bare disingenuous corporation damage control and co-option, in ways once again sure to spark Reddit theories. Nothing is quite as it seems.",
      "Apple need the series to be popular, too, with each episode costing $20m (\u00a316m) to make according to Bloomberg - a big investment given plans to rein in spending after years of streaming services disrupting the market.",
      "In yesterday's season opener, we saw Mark's innie (newly sentient after his team's brief escape into the outside world) return to work to find his team replaced.",
      "Floor manager Milchick explains that in the five months since the uprising, fellow manager Harmony (known to workers as Ms. Cobel) has been fired, with himself promoted in her place. The team is also being promised workplace reform - including improved staff perks.",
      "After all, nothing better conveyed Lumon's unnerving forced fun than its heavily rationed waffle, melon and single-track dance parties. An HR video even reframes the team's rebellion positively, encouraging staff to \"praise Kier\" for the uprising.",
      "Mark's attempts to reunite his team are thwarted by Milchick. But newly empowered by his trip to the outside world, he decides to challenge the shadowy forces that run the company directly.",
      "This push and pull between Mark and a faceless employer may strike a chord with those being forced to go back into the office as companies clamp down on remote working post-pandemic. This month, the bank JPMorgan Chase reportedly closed comments on an intranet page announcing its return-to-work edict, following a tide of negative responses.",
      "This new series comes at a time when the balance of power is arguably shifting in favour of employers again, after a total of 100 million Americans quit their jobs in 2021 and 2022 in what Stanford economics professor Nicholas Bloom called the Great Resignation.",
      "Disillusionment has sparked cultural shifts amongst office workers. The term 'quiet quitting' has emerged, referring to doing the bare minimum in a job. Similarly \"late-stage capitalism\" has gained traction on social media, not for its Marxist roots, but to describe perceived inequalities, societal burnout and a faltering system.",
      "The board will (not) see you now",
      "In series two, we see how Lumon's disorientating, unforgiving corporate culture and its deceptive pleasantries affects those with power too. Floor managers Milchick and newly-demoted Harmony become victims as well as enforcers.",
      "Arquette, who won an Oscar for Richard Linklater's 2014 film Boyhood, says her character is \"furious\" that the corporation, in demoting her, has failed to recognise her loyalty.",
      "Tillman similarly adds that whilst it is unclear whether Milchick betrayed Harmony, he bears a \"heavy responsibility\" on his shoulders. As her replacement, he must now both placate the innies and please a board who \"do not understand what it takes to do the job\".",
      "Unlike Scott, Tillman worked in corporate office roles prior to becoming an actor and landing his breakthrough role as company man Milchick. He says he was never as \"arrogant or ambitious\" as his character, but admits to occasionally being \"adventurous\" in navigating office politics. This either worked well or, sometimes, landed him \"flat on my face\".",

      "\"Rest in peace, Joan...\"",
      "She had been retired for a decade, having lost her eyesight and been registered blind.",
      "Born in Scunthorpe, Plowright became a leading lady in London's West End in the 1950s, and first appeared opposite Olivier in John Osborne's The Entertainer at the Royal Court in 1957.",
      "He was still married to Gone With The Wind star Vivien Leigh at the time, and Plowright was married to her first husband Roger Gage.",
      "Plowright and Olivier fell in love, and their acting partnership earned them both Bafta nominations for the film version of The Entertainer, which came out in 1960.",
      "That year, Plowright also made her breakthrough in the US in A Taste of Honey on Broadway, winning a Tony Award for her performance.",

      "In a clip from the show, which went viral online, a slightly disguntled Dame Maggie is seen telling Dame Judi she was \"always asked first\" when acting roles were offered.",
      "The exchange was initially missed by Dame Joan because one of her hearing aids had fallen out, but she then joined in the joke, also recounting a similar story. She was then offered a spare hearing aid by the late Dame Maggie, who died in September 2024.",
      "'Incredibly wise and witty'",
      "Dame Joan was part of an \"extraordinary\" acting company that her husband assembled when the National Theatre began life at the Old Vic theatre in the early 1960s, according to playwright David Hare.",
      "Others included Maggie Smith, Michael Redgrave, Derek Jacobi and Michael Gambon.",
      "\"She represented, at that point, a new realism in the theatre - a working class background, obviously, like many of her contemporaries,\" Hare told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.",
      "\"And she had the not very easy task of being Laurence Olivier's wife while Laurence Olivier was running the theatre, and she handled that situation extremely well.\"",
      "Hare added: \"I'll also remember her as an incredibly wise and witty woman. She was very good fun, and she liked to laugh, and she used humour all the time to defuse some of the tensions that grew up around her husband.\"",
      "When he first worked with her at the age of 23, Hare said he was \"totally out of my depth, and she never treated me with anything but friendliness, courtesy and wit\".",
      "The National Theatre's current director, Rufus Norris, said Dame Joan's \"contribution as one of the central pillars of the National Theatre cannot be overstated\".",

      "She made her stage debut as a professional actress, in Croydon, in 1948 and by 1956, she had joined the Royal Court theatre in London.",
      "At the time, the Royal Court was a hotbed of new talent, specialising in controversial works. It was also the spiritual birthplace of the kitchen-sink drama.",
      "Plowright gained recognition in a series of productions penned by this group of Angry Young Men, in roles that relied on acting ability rather than mere glamour.",

      "In 1957, she co-starred with Sir Laurence Olivier in a production of John Osborne's play The Entertainer.",
      "Olivier, who was playing Archie Rice, was at the peak of his acting career and considered something of a matinee idol.",
      "Plowright played his daughter and the actors' mutual respect led to romance. \"Nothing is so sexy in a man as talent,\" she observed.",
      "She was initially cautious about a relationship with him - Olivier was 22 years older and already one half of Britain's most celebrated theatrical couple, married to Vivien Leigh.",
      "Plowright herself was married to fellow actor Roger Gage.",
      "But Leigh, Sir Lawrence's second wife, who was troubled by mental illness,  divorced Olivier in 1960.",

      "The Guardian's Michael Billington called it \"one of the great Chekhov experiences of the 20th Century...that brought tears to my eyes\".",
      "They went on to have three children, but their marriage was not without its difficulties.",
      "\"He has extremes of behaviour, which you understand,\" she later said. \"You just find a way not to be swept overboard by his demons.\"",
      "Their relationship also led her to refuse for five years to appear at the National Theatre, where her husband was director from 1962\u20131973.",
      "The actress felt  she would have been vulnerable to accusations of favouritism.",
      "Eventually though, she took a contract with the theatre for a decade, in far grander roles than those at the Royal Court.",
      "By now, her husband had been elevated to the peerage - which made her Lady Olivier - but she didn't use the title.",
      "Plowright won a Golden Globe and was Oscar-nominated for her appearance in the 1992 film Enchanted April.",
      "In fact, she won two Golden Globes in one year - the other coming for HBO TV movie Stalin.",
      "Her other films included Three Sisters in 1970 and The Merchant of Venice in 1973 - both opposite her husband and both based on National Theatre productions.",
      "She also played Mrs Fairfax in 1996's Jane Eyre, and her range went far beyond the classics in films like Dennis the Menace, Last Action Hero and 101 Dalmatians.",
      "As Lord Olivier's health declined, his wife accepted her first big-screen role in the 1990 black comedy I Love You to Death, with Kevin Kline and Tracey Ullman.",

    "story": [
      "The Traitors is one of the few things getting us through a miserable January. For three nights a week, it feels as if the whole country is living and breathing the cloaks-and-daggers drama.",
      "For the other four painstaking days when the show isn't on air, we're sharing our opinions and theories with everyone from colleagues to strangers online.",
      "But it's not just tactics and contestants viewers are talking about - my group chats are incessantly pinging with questions about what happens behind the scenes, where the cast go once they leave the castle, and whether Charlotte will ever reveal her real accent.",
      "Luckily, we no longer need to ponder most of these questions, as former contestants have been speaking to BBC News about the secret workings of the Traitors castle.",
      "What does a typical day in the castle look like, and what happens before breakfast?",
      "The order in which the contestants arrive at breakfast is a source of tension and speculation on the show.",
      "Series one faithful Maddy Smedley explains that contestants are kept in separate holding rooms when they come to the castle in the morning and are called to go into breakfast individually or as a group.",
      "Similarly, in the evenings, contestants wait in a holding room until a runner comes to individually escort them out of the building and into a car.",
      "Traitor and series two champion Harry Clark says there are no clocks in the castle and contestants have no sense of time.",
      "\"You get picked up in the morning and when filming is over, you get dropped back to the lodgings,\" he explains.",
      "\"I don't know what time the mission starts or when lunch is - we rely on the production team to direct us and in between, we all just sit around and chat.\"",
      "Unlike the hour-long episodes we see, Harry says the days aren't filled with wall-to-wall traitor speculation.",
      "\"I spent most the day talking to Paul about Liverpool and Chelsea or finding out if everyone believes in aliens and obviously that stuff doesn't make the final edit because it's not relevant to the game.\"",
      "Series one faithful Dr Amos Ogunkoya describes his days in the castle as \"a really nice holiday camp, until the roundtable\".",
      "\"Most of the day we're just learning about each others lives and so you become really close to everyone there.\"",
      "Matt Harris, another faithful in series one, says that, while the castle is huge, \"you're not allowed out of sight from the cameras so you can't walk around the grounds\".",
      "\"They set up the rooms like the library and bar especially for the show and you're told by producers which rooms you can go into.\"",
      "How long does the roundtable really last?",
      "The lack of clocks make it hard to know exactly how long anything lasts but the roundtable surely far surpasses its 10 minutes of screen time.",
      "\"At the beginning, there are 22 people,\" says Harry. \"Even if everyone only speaks for 10 minutes, that's more than three hours.\"",
      "As viewers, it can be hard to understand why contestants are so emotional during and after the roundtable, but Harry says it's \"really intense\".",
      "\"Everyone has their own story and you're taking someone's chance of winning money away if they are banished.\"",
      "Maddy says she cried so much on the show that \"the security guards would give me ice every morning to help the puffiness of my face go down\".",
      "Where do contestants sleep?",
      "The exact location of contestants' lodgings remains a mystery to us, and apparently to the cast as well.",
      "\"It's about a 30-minute drive from the castle but you're blindfolded as you approach, so you can't see the car in front or figure out exactly where you are,\" Maddy says.",
      "She explains that the whole production team and cast stay in private lodgings but you're kept apart from everyone \"with military precision\".",
      "\"You're allowed to go for a walk but you have to be accompanied by a runner and each floor is manned by two security guards who ensure you don't leave your room unaccompanied.",
      "\"At first, I was really scared of them because I had watched the Dutch version of the show and in that, the faithful are murdered in their hotel room so every time the guard knocked on my door I thought I was going to leave the game,\" she says.",
      "Harry explains he felt lonely at times in the accommodation, especially as contestants have their phones taken away. \"But I can't complain because I slept easy every night knowing I'd be turning up for breakfast!\"",
      "What do contestants eat?",
      "Every now and then viewers get a quick glimpse of a bowl of fruit at breakfast or someone piling carrots onto their plate at dinner time.",
      "The contestants we spoke to gave the food provided on the show mixed reviews.",
      "Dr Amos says \"the breakfast was horrible, you definitely would not want to eat much of it\" but Matt was more generous and described it as \"decent\".",
      "Harry says \"there was a lot of Scottish food like haggis\" adding that as a fussy eater, he \"wouldn't touch it\".",
      "But luckily for Harry, there was the option to request food.",
      "During the day, he says he ate \"a lot of chicken nuggets and chips\" and, in the evening, he would ask for the \"perfect traitor fuel\" to be delivered to his lodgings - a crisp sandwich.",
      "What happens when contestants are banished or murdered?",
      "If a contestant is banished at the roundtable, they \"really do leave immediately\", according to Maddy.",
      "\"You're taken to do an exit interview straight away and then driven to your hotel to pack your stuff. The next day, I was escorted by security in the morning to the airport and was given my phone back.\"",
      "Maddy says the more stressful way of leaving the show is through murder.",
      "\"You turn up in the morning like you're going to breakfast and you are all waiting in these holding rooms. Eventually, you get called as if you're going to breakfast but instead, they take you to another room where the murder letter is sitting on a chair.",
      "\"It was so stressful.\"",
      "Do producers tell contestants what to say and do?",
      "\"The biggest shock was how unscripted everything is,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "Maddy says the only time producers intervened was to tell her to announce that she was an actor over breakfast.",
      "She explains she'd already shared this with her fellow contestants when they were waiting to be taken back to the hotel and had taken their mics off.",
      "Matt says there were some moments that were guided by producers.",
      "\"Occasionally, people were pulled out and told to go and speak to some other people - it's natural that they guide you into a position to make good TV.\"",
      "\"It's weird at first because there are cameras in your face but after a while, you forget they're there and producers don't ever step in,\" Harry adds.",
      "\"Most rooms also just have cameras in the corner and you have a mic attached to you so sometimes, you don't see any of the producers until the end of the day when they check in on you.\"",
      "Mike Cotton, creative director of the studio that makes The Traitors, explains that there are cameras \"dotted around every single room\".",
      "\"I'd say there's probably about 50 or 60 of those throughout the the living space within the castle.\"",
      "He says a team of camera operators works in pairs to follow the cast around into different rooms - but at a distance.",
      "At the roundtable, he says the cameras are hidden and some are built into the table itself.",
      "\"The contestants can't see any cameras and that's to keep them immersed as they can only see each other,\" he explains.",
      "What is Claudia Winkleman like?",
      "\"When I met Claudia, I was so nervous because she's so powerful,\" says Harry.",
      "\"I wanted to be a traitor so badly and I thought she'd take no notice of us but actually, she knew everything about everyone.",
      "\"She gets really involved and makes you feel really comfortable.\"",
      "How much does Claudia Winkleman know about the challenges?",
      "\"Very little,\" according to Harry.",
      "\"There's a team that create the missions and everyone else is in the dark about them. I would try off-camera to get them to tell me about it or I'd give them ideas but they wouldn't listen.\"",
      "Claudia recently said her biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables.",
      "\"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head,\" she explained.",
      "How are traitors selected?",
      "Speaking to BBC News and other press last month, Claudia explained there's a team of people who make the decision.",
      "\"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "The team take the players' wishes into consideration and if someone asks not to be a traitor, they wouldn't be picked.",
      "Dr Amos says he made it very clear that he wouldn't appear on the show if he wasn't a faithful.",
      "\"I wanted to take part in the show but as a doctor I think being a traitor and lying to people has real-life consequences as my patients might not trust me.\"",
      "How do you get on The Traitors?",
      "One thing that's clear from speaking to the contestants is applying for the show is hard work.",
      "After firing off your initial written and video applications, you have a number of audiences with producers.",
      "\"They ask you to mainly tell them stories about yourself and your life,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "\"Eventually, if they like you, then you get a phone call a few weeks before [filming starts] to say you're off to Scotland,\" adds Harry.",
      "Where is The Traitors castle?",
      "The Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century building about 30 miles north of Inverness.",
      "It is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland and has been owned by the McTaggart family since 1983.",
      "Fun fact: its previous owner was Charles William Dyson Perrins whose grandfather, William Perrins (in partnership with John Wheeley Lea) created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce.",
      "How many people are involved in the production?",
      "Mike Cotton says the crew on location is made up of more than 200 people.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely huge but we film one episode a day,\" he says.",
      "He explains that this team includes everyone from producers and camera operators to the art department who work their magic on interior designing the rooms.",
      "He likens the production to one you might find on set for a Hollywood film.",
      "Dr Amos says that every member of the crew knew who the traitors were.",
      "\"It looks like the faithful are in the majority on the show but in reality, you massively feel in the minority -  everyone down to the psychologist who is there to support you knows who the traitors are.\"",

    "summary": "The visionary director's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin was perfected in the iconic 1990 TV series.",
    "story": [
      "David Lynch once said he was inspired to become a filmmaker when, while painting, he inexplicably heard a gust of wind and saw the artwork move on canvas.",
      "The moment defined his obsession with \"seeing paintings move\", but also his flair for the bizarre - twisting realities on the small and big screen for almost 40 years.",
      "The 78-year-old US director, who has died months after announcing an emphysema diagnosis, became the contemporary face of weird, unsettling worlds often hidden within everyday society  - from TV series Twin Peaks to films like Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire.",
      "A self-professed daydreamer, Lynch burst onto the scene via the midnight movie circuit with 1977's Eraserhead. The disorientating horror, a comment on male paranoia, set the layered template that ran through his work.",
      "Four decades later, he lived to see his style immortalised as an adjective in the Oxford dictionary. Lynchian, it reads, blurs \"surreal or sinister elements with the mundane\" - an accolade fitting of the four-time Oscar nominee turned lifetime achievement recipient, whose character was as big as his films.",
      "David Keith Lynch was born in Missoula, Montana on January 20, 1946. The son of a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, he spent much of his early life moving around from state to state with his brother and sister.",
      "However, Lynch's parents encouraged his artistic ambitions from an early age. Speaking to Rolling Stone in 1990, he said his mother \"saved\" him by encouraging him to draw on scrap paper rather than using colouring books, where \"the whole idea is to stay between the lines\".",
      "This ethos inspired his films, tinged by a rebellious streak which he teased lasted from the age of 14 to 30. \"People rebel that long these days\", he reasoned, \"because we're built to live longer\".",
      "Youthful frustration at the calm of suburban life left him craving for \"something out of the ordinary to happen\" to challenge the superficiality of 1950s family ideals - a dark dream his films and shows brought to life.",
      "Lynch's black-and-white debut feature Eraserhead achieved this vision far more successfully than his years at art school, with its central character descending into madness after fathering a terrifying baby.",
      "Critics were left confused, but its late-night cinema success sparked a breakthrough when one audience member recommended him to Mel Brooks, who asked him to helm Elephant Man.",
      "Co-written by Lynch, the film's cast of eventual screen icons, including John Hurt as Merrick and Anthony Hopkins, transformed the story of stigma into an emotional, critical hit, outpacing the original stage play.",
      "It saw Lynch receive Oscar nominations for best director and adapted screenplay, as part of the film's eight nominations that included best picture.",
      "But if Hollywood thought it had found a new blockbuster master, Tinseltown quickly discovered Lynch had no interest in playing mainstream with his 1984 adaptation of sci-fi epic Dune.",
      "Featuring questionable special effects, costumes and rock star Sting lathered in baby oil, the Guardian's Charles Bramesco wrote that Lynch's experiments left the franchise \"radioactive for decades\". \"I'm proud of everything except Dune,\" Lynch would later tell a YouTube Q&A, while admitting elsewhere it almost \"killed\" his career.",
      "Coffee, cherry pie... and Twin Peaks",
      "The wounds began to heal, however, when he returned to double down on his signature style - placing his fascination with America's dirty underbelly in his sights.",
      "Blue Velvet, starring Kyle MacLachlan from Dune, followed a small-town boy caught up in the underworld after he discovered a severed ear. Brutal and violent in part, it divided critics but won Lynch his second Oscar nod for best director.",
      "\"This is the way America is to me,\" Lynch would later describe the movie in his book Lynch on Lynch. \"There's a very innocent, naive quality to life, and there's a horror and a sickness as well\".",
      "He won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival for romance Wild at Heart in 1990, starring Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe.",
      "But it was Lynch's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin, perfected in his TV project Twin Peaks released the same year, that came to define him.",
      "On paper, the unsettling drama explored the murky goings-on in the US logging town following the murder of teenage beauty queen Laura Palmer, hauntingly brought to life by Sheryl Lee.",
      "But viewers were truly captivated by what it offered onscreen: a dreamlike nightmare of wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, including FBI agent Dale Cooper, again played by Kyle MacLachlan, in the apparent comfort of picket-fenced America - cherry pie and coffee included - before unflinchingly reaching into living rooms with its chilling undercurrent of sexual abuse and murder. It was one that had no prior place on US TV.",
      "The ABC show won three Golden Globe awards in 1991, including best TV drama series and best actor in a TV drama for MacLachlan.",
      "\"Without Twin Peaks, and its big-bang expansion of the possibilities of television, half your favourite shows wouldn't exist,\" wrote James Parker for The Atlantic.",
      "The show, he continued, \"effectively renegotiated TV's contract with its audience\".",
      "It mattered little that the second season faltered after the killer was revealed. TV was no longer safe, it was viscerally alive - big screen ideas and production values somehow beamed into living rooms in an age when the silver screen still ruled.",
      "In 1992, viewers were taken back to Twin Peaks with a prequel feature film, Fire Walk With Me, but nothing quite matched the original run.",
      "When the nation asked \"Who killed Laura Palmer?\", it wasn't just about solving the mystery, but finding sanctuary from rotten realities society would rather ignore.  Lynch had found his darkness.",
      "He would eventually shift focus back to the big screen to attack Hollywood's devilish tricks of fame, glamour, deceit and identity loss, in films unofficially known as his Los Angeles trilogy.",
      "This began with 1997's Lost Highway, before 2001's Mulholland Drive - perhaps the closest in aesthetic to Twin Peaks.",
      "The psychological drama received critical acclaim, scoring Lynch his third best director Oscar nomination and scooping the best director gong at Cannes. In recent years it has also been recognised for its queer themes, particularly between Naomi Watts' and Laura Harring's characters, that challenged traditional Hollywood storytelling of the time.",
      "Last came 2006's Inland Empire, Lynch's final feature film, which proved as mind-melting as ever - showing Hollywood star culture no mercy.",
      "As Mike Muncer told BBC Arts' Inside Cinema: \"Lynch lures us in with the promise of familiar, traditional genre thrills and mysteries as a safety net, before that weirdness starts to creep in.",
      "\"Eventually, the mystery box is opened, revealing the darker, more sinister story that Lynch has actually been telling us all along.\"",
      "Cult icon",
      "In his latter years Lynch enjoyed revered cult status. In 2017, he directed Twin Peaks: The Return, a new series set 25 years after the events of the original show, with much of the same cast.",
      "At the same time, the show's legacy continues to endure, inspiring dramas like True Detective and 2023's critically acclaimed Playstation survival horror game Alan Wake II.",
      "Away from the camera, Lynch admitted he had sometimes struggled to balance the \"tricky business\" of fatherhood with his career.",
      "He welcomed four children - Jennifer, Austin, Riley and Lula - with ex-wives Peggy Reavey, Mary Fisk and Mary Sweeney, and estranged wife Emily Stofle.",
      "\"I love all my children and we get along great, but in the early years, before you can have a relationship of talking to them, it's tough,\" he told Vulture. \"The work is the main thing, and I know I've caused suffering because of that. But at the same time I have huge love for the kids.\"",
      "Although Lynch never did return to feature film directing to give himself another shot at an elusive Oscar win, he was granted an honorary lifetime achievement statuette by the Academy in 2019. He also made a cameo in Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical 2022 film, The Fablemans, playing filmmaker John Ford.",
      "His artistic pursuits increasingly diversified toward the end of his life, from his original passion for painting to music. Just last year, he released Cellophane Memories, an album with Chrystabell. This added to his previous work producing music videos for artists like Moby and Nine Inch Nails.",

      "However his ideas live on, as unique as the way he described thinking of them.",
      "Speaking in conversation with musician Patti Smith for BBC Newsnight in 2014, he said: \"I get ideas in fragments. It's as if in the other room there's a puzzle - all the pieces are together.",

      "\"It came as a huge shock. We knew Linda was very ill, of course, but she had always soldiered on.",
      "\"She was such a trouper, she had such a strength of character,\" said Mr Knight, who recalled his time performing alongside her in Willy Russell's Blood Brothers in London's West End, in which she played Mrs Johnstone.",
      "\"Linda was so warm. There was a huge family that worked Blood Brothers \u2013 she was so encouraging to younger cast members particularly. She really became friends with everyone. She was a star on stage and off and so generous.\"",

    "story": [
      "After 60 years, Match of the Day is abandoning its sole presenter format and taking on three people who will, in turn, host the show. It is a departure, but it is far from a new strategy in TV.",
      "Match of the Day has, extraordinarily, had just five main presenters in its history - with Gary Lineker being in the hot seat for the past 26 years.",
      "His replacements, who will take over the BBC One football highlights show next season, are all broadcasters rather than sports stars who have taken up broadcasting as a second career.",
      "Lineker and, before him in the 70s and 80s, Jimmy Hill, were examples of former players who were comfortable taking the lead in the studio, but they were more an exception than a rule when it comes to hosting sports programmes.",

      "There was speculation that footballer-turned-broadcaster Alex Scott would take over the show - but in the end, the names in the press release are all stalwarts of decades of live broadcasting.",

      "Likewise, Gabby Logan has been presenting for 30 years. And Mark Chapman has 29 years under his belt and is already the face of Match of the Day 2 on Sundays.",
      "By choosing three new hosts, the BBC is following a pattern in TV where a brand or format becomes less associated with a single name.",

      "Match of the Day has now been handed over to some very safe hands.",
      "And based on their track records, none of them look likely to attract the sorts of headlines that Lineker has had in recent years.",
      "There is good reason to be careful. At a time when TV ratings have been falling year after year, Match of the Day has been holding steady.",
      "In an era when every Premier League match is televised somewhere and social media is awash with clips of goals as soon as they happen, there was always a question about whether anyone would still want to watch a highlights show.",
      "However, over the past five years, Match of the Day's audience of just under 3.5 million has remained almost unchanged. Over a season, the BBC says 33 million people will tune in at some time to one of the Match of the Day programmes.",
      "The resilience of Match of the Day has not gone unnoticed, and with the current rights deal due to continue until the 2028/29 season, this is a brand the BBC hopes to grow.",
      "There have been reports that the corporation will use the shake-up as an opportunity to use the MOTD name more widely on its online platforms.",

    "summary": "The policy was brought in two years ago in England to try to encourage healthier food choices.",
    "story": [
      "Putting calories on food labels and menus \"is no silver bullet\", say researchers who analysed the best evidence to date on how effective the policy can be.",
      "A review of 25 studies on calorie labelling in a number of countries found a small reduction in the calories people chose to eat - equivalent to two almonds - but even  this modest effect could help prevent adults putting on weight as they get older.",
      "The new rules on calorie labelling came into force in England in 2022 as part of government plans to encourage people to make healthier choices.",
      "The government said it would continue to evaluate the impact, including on people with eating disorders.",
      "Restaurants, cafes and take-aways with more than 250 staff must now show how many calories are in meals on their menus.",
      "For Imara, a 27-year-old HR assistant from Birmingham, the change has been a positive part of her weight-loss journey.",
      "\"It has meant that I have been able to stay on track, stay within my calorie deficit and still enjoy a nice meal out with friends, or with my husband, and still have a good time and not worry about falling off track.",
      "\"Sometimes I will just have a meal and not think about the calories,\" she says.",
      "\"But if it is a day or a week where I do want to stay on track then I will look at the calories and see whether it is something that will fit within my goals.\"",
      "The research looked at studies of the impact of calorie labels in supermarkets, restaurants and other food outlets in countries including the United States, UK, Canada and France.",
      "In a 600-calorie meal, it found an average reduction of 11 calories (or 1.8%) in the food people chose and bought.",
      "Senior author Dr Gareth Hollands from University College London, said there was \"a small but potentially meaningful effect on people's food choices\" but \"we should not expect miracles\".",
      "He said calorie labelling \"may have a useful role\" alongside other measures, such as taxes on food and drinks, marketing restrictions and reformulation - making manufacturers adjust recipes for food products to make them healthier.",
      "Dr Natasha Clarke of Bath Spa University, who began the project at the University of Cambridge, says the evidence is \"robust\".",
      "And as calorie labelling becomes more widespread, the effect could have a \"meaningful contribution\" to public health.",

      "She says calorie counting is what \"fed\" her eating disorder.",

      "The review acknowledged a \"lack of data\" of the possible harms including mental health impacts, and the authors have recommended future research to assess this.",

      "Bereaved parents say they are concerned that the trust's chief executive during the period most of the deaths occurred is now leading the regulator, saying this could affect its independence in investigating LTH Trust.",
      "In a statement, the trust told the BBC the vast majority of births at Leeds were safe, and deaths of mothers and babies were fortunately very rare.",
      "It added that Leeds cares for a higher volume of babies with complex conditions as it is one of a \"handful of specialist centres\" in the UK.",
      "The trust's maternity units are at Leeds General Infirmary and St James's University Hospital.",
      "The families describe a \"tick box\" and \"wait and see\" culture at the trust, plus a lack of compassionate care.",
      "This has been echoed by whistleblower Lisa Elliott, who worked at the two sites in 2023. Describing the care as \"appalling\", she highlighted a failure to listen to patients. \"That's when disasters happen, and a lot of them can be avoided,\" she said.",
      "The families are calling for an independent review into LTH Trust to ensure issues are identified and lessons learned. They also want an independent, judge-led public inquiry to help improve maternity safety across England because of wider concerns about the standard of care.",
      "The BBC obtained data from the trust showing potentially preventable baby deaths through a Freedom of Information request.",
      "This revealed at least 56 cases from January 2019 to July 2024, made up of 27 stillbirths and 29 neonatal deaths - which is a death within 28 days after birth.",
      "In each case, a trust review group had identified care issues it considered may have made a difference to the outcome for babies.",
      "The trust-led reviews were conducted by multidisciplinary teams which regularly included people who did not work for the trust.",
      "The trust also recorded two possibly preventable maternal deaths in the same period.",
      "It did not give any personal details about the 58 deaths, so we do not know whether they include the families we have spoken to.",
      "The deaths reviewed by the trust included babies with congenital abnormalities, and newborns and mothers transferred after birth from other units because they required specialist care.",
      "The trust said the number of neonatal deaths it had recorded as potentially avoidable was \"very small\".",
      "Warning: This article contains images that some may find distressing",
      "LTH had the highest neonatal mortality rate in the UK of 4.46 per 1,000 live births in 2022, according to the latest report by MBRRACE-UK - which reviews stillbirths and neonatal deaths but does not analyse if any of these are potentially preventable.",
      "BBC analysis of this data, which was made public last July, shows this increased from 3.30 per 1,000 live births in 2017.",
      "The LTH 2022 figure is 70% higher than the average rate for comparable NHS trusts.",
      "MBRRACE-UK grouped Leeds with 25 other trusts which it says provide a similar level of care. Specifically, they all have a level three (the highest level) neonatal intensive care unit and perform neonatal surgery. The group is complex, with different specialisms.",
      "LTH told the BBC there are an increasing number of complex pregnancies and births in the region - including an increase in babies born with severe cardiac conditions - leading to an increase in the neonatal mortality rate.",
      "Fiona Winser-Ramm and Dan Ramm's first baby, Aliona Grace, died at Leeds General Infirmary in January 2020, 27 minutes after she was born.",
      "There had been delays admitting Fiona after her waters broke and a delay by midwives to escalate concerns with Aliona's heart rate during labour.",

      "\"Leeds say they've learned lessons, it won't happen again. But it does, and babies keep dying, or being seriously injured, for similar reasons,\" says Dan.",

      "Details of advice and support with child bereavement are available at BBC Action Line",
      "Fiona and Dan also believe the regulator - the Care Quality Commission (CQC) has failed to hold the trust accountable, despite other preventable baby deaths.",
      "The CQC inspects the quality of services across health and adult social care in England and can prosecute providers who fail to provide safe care.",
      "The couple first raised their safety concerns with the body in November 2020. They say the regulator is not fit for purpose.",
      "They are taking legal action against LTH Trust, but also want the CQC to prosecute it for its care failures.",
      "Fiona and Dan don't think any future CQC investigation into Leeds could be independent with the trust's former chief executive in charge of the regulator.",
      "Sir Julian Hartley led the trust for 10 years, until January 2023, and was in post when Aliona died. He took over the CQC in December 2024.",
      "\"There's a huge conflict of interest,\" says Dan.",
      "We approached the CQC and Sir Julian for comment and the regulator replied on behalf of both saying it was independent, with \"robust policies in place to manage any conflict of interest\".",
      "It says there are currently no criminal investigations into Leeds maternity services, but it has been in contact with families and is looking into four incidents for evidence for any future legal action.",
      "Among the bereaved parents are Amarjit Kaur and Mandip Singh Matharoo, who were expecting their first child to arrive last February.",
      "When Amarjit was 32 weeks pregnant, she went to Leeds General Infirmary's maternity unit twice within 24 hours with severe abdominal pain. She says she was told she was experiencing ligament pain in her torso and was sent home each time with paracetamol.",
      "A few days later, Amarjit underwent emergency surgery and she says a massive blood clot was found, exactly where she had described being in pain.",
      "Her daughter, Asees, was stillborn on 6 January 2024. The couple believe she would have survived if her mother had not been sent home earlier.",
      "\"It's been the hardest year of my life,\" Amarjit says.",
      "A review led by the trust of Amarjit's care identified issues it considered may have made a difference to the baby's outcome.",
      "Black mothers are nearly three times more likely to die than their white counterparts (35.1 per 100,000 maternities), with Asian women nearly twice as likely (20.16 per 100,000 maternities), latest UK figures from MBRRACE-UK show.",
      "Last year, 15.7% of registrable births at LTH were recorded as Asian and 11.8% were black.",
      "Amarjit believes she was treated differently because of her Indian ethnicity.",
      "During her first visit, she says she overheard a white woman being told by midwives that she could \"stay as long as you want\" because of her pain - but Amarjit was sent home.",
      "\"The only difference between me and her was the colour of my skin,\" she says. \"But I was in so much pain I couldn't move.\"",
      "The trust's review of Amarjit's care said \"the concerns about institutional racism have been taken seriously\" and escalated to senior management.",
      "The two whistleblowers have described unsafe care while working at both of the units.",
      "One experienced clinical staff member, currently at Leeds and who has asked to remain anonymous, told us the service is \"completely broken\" with chronic understaffing, with the impact being that \"women and babies are not getting the care we want them to get\".",
      "These concerns are echoed by a former temporary staff member, Lisa Elliott, who says she saw \"chaotic\" care when she worked approximately 40 shifts as a maternity support worker during 2023. While in this role, supporting midwives in their care of women, she says she witnessed \"rude\" treatment of patients by staff who showed a lack of empathy.",
      "Lisa, who says she began working shifts in the hospitals in 2020, says she was present for a CQC inspection in 2024, but does not think maternity services should be rated \"good\". She says she flagged concerns about staff attitudes at the time, but they were not \"taken into account properly\".",
      "Prof Phil Wood, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals told the BBC the trust wished to apologise to the women and families who had shared their negative experiences.",
      "He highlighted its status as a specialist centre caring for \"the most poorly babies\", adding that comparing the MBBRACE-UK neonatal mortality data from LTH with other hospitals, \"even in the same specialist category, is fraught with difficulty and is misleading\".",
      "Chris Dzikiti, CQC's interim chief inspector of healthcare, said LTH's maternity services have, and continue to be, subject to close oversight.",
      "He added that the maternity services at the two hospitals were inspected last month \"in response to concerns raised by families and risks identified through our ongoing monitoring\".",
      "The findings from that inspection will be published shortly.",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the government was determined to learn lessons from recent investigations to ensure women and babies \"receive safe, personalised and compassionate care\".",
      "They added: \"We will support trusts failing on maternity care to make rapid improvements and work closely with NHS England to train thousands more midwives to support women throughout their pregnancy and beyond.\"",

    "story": [
      "Country music singer Lisa McHugh has told how her baby daughter spent 10 \"horrendous\" days in hospital after contracting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).",
      "RSV is a common, but highly infectious, respiratory virus that affects the breathing system, particularly in young children and older adults.",
      "\"You feel so helpless, and it's the most horrible feeling for a parent to go through, to not be able to fix what's going on or help,\" said Ms McHugh.",
      "According to the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland, there have been more than 1,000 cases of RSV in infants under the age of one since 30 September 2024.",
      "About two thirds of the infants have been hospitalised.",
      "An RSV vaccine has been available to pregnant women in Northern Ireland since last September and is offered from 28 weeks into pregnancy.",
      "'My baby was tube fed'",
      "In November 2024, Lisa McHugh's then four-month-old daughter Hallie caught a cold.",
      "Her GP told her to monitor Hallie's symptoms and if the baby was feeding well, was having wet nappies and her temperature was okay, she could manage her at home.",
      "But Hallie's condition deteriorated and she ended up in South West Acute Hospital (SWAH).",
      "She was diagnosed with RSV.",
      "\"From that moment on, it was all a blur and it's still something I don't think I've fully processed,\" said Ms McHugh.",
      "The County Fermanagh-based singer said her daughter had to be tube fed.",
      "\"She had to then go on oxygen, because her oxygen levels were declining below the threshold that they needed to be for her to be doing it on her own.",
      "\"Within days, she just had really declined. It was absolutely horrendous to see your baby lying there, being so helpless.",
      "\"It's horrible because you can't do anything for them, even though you're trying to.",
      "\"I just knew that I wanted to be in the best place for her, and being at home wasn't the safest place,\" she said.",

      "\"Hallie was very, very sick with it, but it could have been also a lot worse,\" she said.",
      "What is RSV?",
      "Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is one of the common viruses which cause coughs and colds.",
      "Dr Nicholas Lipscomb, a consultant paediatrician in SWAH, said RSV is a seasonal infection and they see a lot of patients between November and February every year, but this winter has been particularly bad.",
      "He said while most babies and children do not need hospital treatment, the younger the child, the more likely it is for them to need hospitalisation, particularly if they are struggling to breathe and feed.",
      "\"For a very young baby, particularly an ex-premature baby, or baby who maybe has an underlying heart issue, it can be very dangerous,\" he said.",
      "\"For the majority of babies, it's just an unpleasant illness. But for those particularly at risk it can be potentially fatal,\" he said.",
      "Ms McHugh, who is originally from Glasgow, said a vaccine was not available to her before she gave birth.",
      "\"Had it been something that was offered to me at the time, knowing what I know now and what we've been through, I would 100% take it myself,\" she said.",
      "Adults aged from 75-79 years of age are also be offered the vaccine, as they can be vulnerable to the virus.",
      "How to stop RSV spreading",
      "Hallie caught RSV again just four weeks after being discharged from hospital.",
      "\"Thankfully, we were more prepared this time. We knew what to watch out for. We knew how to treat her. And thankfully, her symptoms weren't as bad ,\" she said.",
      "The baby was kept in hospital for a day, but got home for Christmas. Now six months old, she is doing well.",
      "\"Her immune system is just very, very low, and it probably will be for quite some time, until we build it back up again.",

      "She is urging parents to be more aware of RSV and not to be afraid of speaking up to protect your baby.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:01:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a hit. The question is why, and what can be done about it?",
    "story": [
      "Covid vaccines saved lives. Lots of them. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) now puts the number at 475,000 in the UK with many more kept out of hospital or off a ventilator.",
      "The jabs were a \"scientific miracle\" we were told at the time, our best hope of life returning to normal after months of lockdown restrictions. But something has happened in the years since. Research suggests confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a significant hit.",
      "\"It's the great paradox of the pandemic,\" says Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher at Swansea University.",
      "\"One of the most successful innovations in public health history, the rapid development of Covid vaccines, has actually had the effect of reducing public confidence in vaccination.\"",
      "In 2023 around 70% of UK adults said that vaccinations were safe and effective, down sharply from 90% in 2018, according to research from the Vaccine Confidence Project, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).",
      "This is very much part of a worldwide trend with 52 of the 55 countries polled seeing a drop in confidence since 2019.",
      "And regular polling carried out by YouGov suggests adults are increasingly likely to say that vaccines have harmful side effects that are not being disclosed to the public. The proportion saying that statement is \"probably\" or \"definitely\" true rose to 30% in 2024 from 19% in 2019.",
      "At the same time, childhood vaccination rates have fallen further below recommended levels over the last five years, continuing a longer-term trend.",
      "\"Vaccines are always our best defence against infectious, communicable diseases,\" adds Dr Williams. \"A few percentage drops in the proportion of children covered can make a real difference.\"",
      "So why is there increased distrust in vaccination - and can anything be done to change that?",
      "The sudden 'sea change' in attitudes",
      "The long-running Covid inquiry has already looked at pandemic planning and the impact on the NHS. This week, though, it opened hearings into the vaccine rollout across the UK, from take-up of the jabs, to their safety, to the way they were marketed to the public.",
      "Dr Helen Wall, a GP from Bolton, saw the shift in vaccines attitudes over the pandemic first-hand.",
      "In May 2021 the town became the centre of national attention; Covid infections  more than quadrupled in three weeks driven by the new Delta variant. A huge vaccine drive was ordered with army medics staffing mobile units. Dr Wall led the rollout, as clinical director of the local NHS commissioning board.",
      "\"People were coming out and making tea and coffee for people in the line,\" she says. \"There was this real feeling of camaraderie.\"",
      "But around the middle of 2021, she noticed a sudden \"sea change\" in attitudes.",
      "\"Patients would start to say to me, 'why should I trust you, you work for them, you're being paid by them, you're part of the government'.",
      "\"We very quickly went from being lifesavers to just another part of the system that no-one trusted in some spheres.\"",
      "Before long, protestors appeared outside local clinics with placards trying to convince people not get jabbed, and Dr Wall says that she received death threats.",
      "Nearly four years on, she reflects: \"I think what Covid has done is amplified a confidence issue that was already there and ramped up some of the doubts and question-marks for people.\"",
      "From smallpox to MMR",
      "But vaccine hesitancy certainly did not start with the pandemic. The current wave of scepticism is the latest rekindling of an angry debate going back to the dawn of vaccination in 1796 when Edward Jenner created the smallpox vaccine.",
      "In the 1890s huge crowds protested in Leicester against mandatory smallpox vaccinations. Then in the 1970s the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough jab was linked to brain injury in children, before later being found safe.",
      "In 1998 British doctor Andrew Wakefield published his now infamous research paper falsely claiming the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was responsible for rising rates of autism in children.",
      "Wakefield's research, described as the most damaging scientific fraud of all time, has since been thoroughly discredited and he was struck off the doctors' register.",
      "But the damage was done. The number of measles cases in England and Wales jumped to 2,032 in 2012 from just 56 in 1998. It took more than a decade for MMR uptake to return to anything like normal and that debunked link with autism still gets repeated today.",
      "It was the first serious medical scandal of the internet era and also a sign of things to come.",
      "Internet age and misinformation",
      "Since the birth of social media in the early 2000s, with sites like Friendster and MySpace, there have been growing concerns about the spread of health rumours and misinformation.",
      "Research from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found 20% of parents surveyed in 2023 said they had come across information online that made them worried about vaccines, a sharp jump from just 6% the year before.",
      "As social media sites have gone from niche start-ups to established parts of the media landscape, so the risk of misinformation has changed.",
      "\"Now somebody in one corner of the world can post something and suddenly millions of people in another part of the world can see it within seconds,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"It's not just the speed but the reach of misinformation which puts us in completely uncharted territory.\"",
      "Where young people stand",
      "Research has consistently shown that younger adults are the group most likely to use social media to make decisions about their personal health, and the most vulnerable to misinformation.",
      "Lockdowns and other restrictions also meant many of those in their late teens and twenties lost out on education, on early job opportunities and on full social lives in the pandemic. At the same time they were far less likely than older groups to fall seriously ill after catching the virus.",
      "\"They were the ones who felt like they paid the price for what was primarily an older person's problem,\" says Prof Heidi Larson, a former head of global immunisation communication at UNICEF and the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at LSHTM.",
      "The data suggests younger groups have also seen the biggest falls in vaccine confidence over the last four years, something she says is the \"most concerning\" part of her research.",
      "The proportion of 18-24-year-olds, for example, who say that vaccines are safe and effective has fallen to under 60% in 2023 from 80% in 2019.",
      "\"They should really be the priority, because these are potential young parents and if they are questioning the importance of vaccines, then we are in trouble,\" says Prof Larson, who is giving expert evidence to the Covid inquiry this week.",
      "\"We have to recognise that this is about the whole experience of Covid, and all the controls and pressures. It's like, 'Enough of being told what to do, I just don't want your vaccines anymore'.\"",
      "Speed and safety concerns",
      "The speed at which new Covid vaccines had to be developed has also been at the centre of some of the rumour, concern and distrust there is online.",
      "The data now shows the jabs did their main job \u2013 helping our bodies clear the virus and cutting the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death.",
      "In early clinical trials though the vaccines were also said to be effective \u2013 90% so in the case of the Pfizer jab \u2013 at preventing Covid in the first place. In real world use, that protection against infection and transmission faded within months, as immunity \"waned \" and the virus mutated into different variants.",
      "Crucially though protection against severe disease has proved far more long-lasting.",
      "Then there were safety concerns.",
      "The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were linked to a rare, but serious, blood clot in the brain and their use was restricted to certain groups.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna jabs, meanwhile, have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, which usually clear up without long-term damage.",
      "The reality is every vaccine, like any medical treatment, always carries a small level of risk, some more than others.",
      "\"The science and public health perspective is quite clear: not only were Covid vaccines safe and effective, but we would have been in a very different world if they hadn't been rolled out so quickly,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"[But] we're in this complicated, murky world with public attitudes where some people thought they weren't what was promised.\"",
      "Vaccine fatigue and 'complacency'",
      "Many people in the UK no longer have direct experience of how dangerous viruses such as measles can be.",
      "The UKHSA says it's been seriously concerned for some time about falling childhood vaccination rates.",
      "The organisation's director of public health programmes, Dr Mary Ramsay, believes that trend, which started in the decade before Covid, is more likely to be driven by complacency than a drop in confidence in the childhood vaccination programme.",
      "Modern lives are also busy and finding time to take a child to a GP for a series of jabs is not always straightforward, she suggests.",
      "In 2024 the number of children receiving a first dose of the MMR vaccine fell to 88.9% in England, the lowest level for 14 years and over the last year we've seen significant measles outbreaks in London, Birmingham and Bristol.",
      "A high level of measles vaccination is vital as it prevents transmission of the virus and protects not just those who receive the jab, but those who can't \u2013 young babies and children with weakened immune systems, for example.",
      "Dr Wall, now clinical director of population health in Greater Manchester, also thinks there might be an element of \"vaccine fatigue\" creeping in since the pandemic, with even some NHS staff left \"tired, jaded and fed-up\" after years of vaccines, boosters, rules and restrictions.",
      "Figures from NHS England, for example, show the number of frontline healthcare workers getting their flu vaccine fell to 35% in November 2024 from 62% in the same month in 2019.",
      "In late 2021, the government brought in a policy of mandatory Covid vaccines for care home staff in England, and later tried to extend that to NHS workers. At times the public were also told they needed Covid jabs (or a recent negative test) to travel abroad, to enter nightclubs and to visit cinemas in parts of the UK.",
      "Those kinds of strict health policies might force up vaccination rates in the short-term, argues Prof Larson at LSHTM, but there's a danger we are now starting to pay a \"long term price\".",
      "The worry is if people feel forced or coerced into taking a vaccine at certain times, wider vaccine confidence and uptake may experience a backlash.",
      "Personal liberty versus state control",
      "For 200 years vaccination has been entangled with personal liberty, state control and other political issues. That's increasingly playing out online where the wider debate also takes in global warming, gun control and immigration, for example.",
      "\"It's 'the people' versus the political and financial elites, with medical and scientific experts seen as among those deemed elitist, speaking a different language and entwined with big business and pharma,\" says Prof Larson.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump's controversial pick for US health secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr, has once again put vaccines firmly on the political agenda.",
      "In the past he has repeated the false claim that vaccines cause autism, urged parents not to jab their children, and had to apologise after claiming the number injured by vaccines was \"a holocaust\".",
      "He has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination, instead saying he is \"pro-safety\".",
      "'We need to be more assertive'",
      "Dr Simon Williams at Swansea University now thinks health authorities have to be clearer about the dangers of some infectious diseases, in the face of online misinformation which often exaggerates the small risk of vaccines.",
      "\"Part of the reason tobacco control campaigns have been so effective since the 1980s was because they were so clear about how dangerous smoking is, and I think we can learn from that,\" he says.",
      "\"We need to be far more assertive about the potential risks of not getting vaccinated.\"",
      "Inside story of Biden's undoing: 'Infighting, frustration and an insular inner circle'",
      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "Another idea is \"pre-bunking\" - that is teaching people to expect and recognise misinformation online before they encounter it in real life, instead of relying on fact-checking and dull public health videos after the event.",
      "Prof Heidi Larson also thinks now is the time to target and better engage with those most at-risk of rejecting vaccines - in particular the younger groups that her data shows are most affected.",
      "\"I would start in schools, I would start in science classes, I think we are losing the plot if we only focus on disinformation, and don't start to build an appreciation of how vaccines work and their benefits,\" she says.",

      "Calling people obese is medically \"flawed\" - and the definition should be split into two, a report from global experts says.",
      "The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease.",
      "This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity.",
      "More than a billion people are estimated to be living with obesity worldwide and prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand.",
      "The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.",
      "\"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said.",
      "\"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added.",
      "The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says.",
      "'I feel blessed to get weight-loss jab' - but can the NHS afford it for all?",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight.",
      "\"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell.",
      "\"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me.",
      "\"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said.",
      "Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI.",

      "In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet.",
      "\"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\"",
      "Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as having a BMI over 30 - a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight.",
      "How is BMI calculated?",
      "It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.",
      "For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in):",
      "square their height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89divide their weight in kilograms by this amount: 70 \u00f7 2.89 = 24.22display the result to one decimal place: 24.2",

      "But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs.",
      "Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says.",
      "\"Obesity is a health risk - the difference is it's also an illness for some,\" Prof Rubino said.",
      "What are the two groups?",
      "Clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a disease, there will be signs of it affecting organs in the body - through heart disease, breathlessness, type 2 diabetes or joint pain - and a person's day-to-day activities. Treatment with drugs or surgery is likely.",
      "Pre-clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a risk to health - but not yet causing any illnesses, people should be offered weight-loss advice, counselling and monitoring, to reduce the chances of health problems developing.",
      "Doctors should also pay close attention to a patient's family history to see if they are at risk of particular diseases.",
      "At a time when drugs that reduce body weight by up to 20% are being prescribed on a large scale, the report says redefining obesity \"is all the more relevant\" because it \"improves the accuracy of diagnosis\".",
      "Access to weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro is often restricted to patients with a BMI over 30 and a weight-related health condition.",
      "Children's obesity expert Prof Louise Baur, from the University of Sydney, who contributed to the report, said the new approach would allow adults and children with obesity \"to receive more appropriate care\", while reducing the numbers being over-diagnosed and given unnecessary treatment.",
      "The Royal College of Physicians said the report laid a strong foundation \"for treating obesity with the same medical rigour and compassion as other chronic illnesses\".",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:57:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump's policies could benefit the US, but not the rest of the world, the IMF says",
    "story": [
      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its growth forecast for the UK economy this year, but has also warned about the possible impact of Donald Trump's economic plans.",
      "The global institution upgraded its prediction for UK growth to 1.6% for this year from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "But it said a threatened wave of tariffs by incoming US president Trump could make trade tensions worse, lower investment, and disrupt supply chains across the world.",
      "The IMF also said although tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation could boost the US economy in the short term, they could ultimately backfire.",
      "The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because they will make it more expensive for companies to sell their goods in the world's biggest economy.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue - and has threatened to issue tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico on day one of his presidency next week.",
      "He has also said he would impose 100% tariffs on the BRICS bloc of nine nations if they were to create a rival currency to the US dollar.",
      "The IMF said such policies could set the scene for an inflationary boom followed by a bust and could weaken US Treasury bonds as a safe bet.",
      "As well as upgrading its outlook for the UK, the IMF suggested the UK economy would perform better than European economies such as Germany, France and Italy over the next two years.",
      "The improved forecast could be a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has faced pressure over her policy decisions this week, after figures showed the economy had flatlined.",
      "Labour has made growth its key objective, but Reeves has admitted the government has to \"do more to grow our economy\", in order to boost living standards.",
      "The latest IMF figures suggested the UK economy had weaker growth last year than the organisation had expected.",
      "Responding to the IMF's report, Reeves highlighted that the UK was the only G7 economy, apart from the US, to have its growth forecast upgraded for 2025.",
      "Forecasts are never perfect given the many factors that affect economic growth - from geopolitics to the weather. But such reports can point in the right direction, especially where they align with other predictions.",
      "Global growth forecast to flatline as tariffs add to strains",
      "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
      "The IMF predicted \"stable, albeit lacklustre\" global growth of 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026, below a historical average of 3.7%.",
      "Its 2025 forecast was largely unchanged from a previous one, mainly because it expects higher US growth than previously predicted to offset lower growth in other major economies.",
      "The imminent arrival of Trump in the White House dominates the section on risks in the IMF's twice-yearly forecast for the world economy.",
      "When he was last in power, Trump launched into a trade war with China, and US policy led to tit-for-tat tariffs with the EU.",
      "This time round, Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on global imports, a 25% duty on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "It warns that an inflationary US boom could be followed by a possible bust that would potentially \"weaken the role of US Treasuries as the global safe asset\".",
      "Investors see US Treasury securities as one of the safest possible bets, because the bonds - which are kind of like an IOU -  are backed by the US government.",
      "In addition, if red tape on business is cut too much, this could lead to a runaway dollar that could suck money out of emerging economies, depressing global growth.",
      "Trump going ahead with deportations of illegal immigrants could \"permanently reduce potential output\" and also raise inflation, The IMF said.",
      "Its chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said \"tremendous uncertainty\" about Trump's future policies was already affecting stock markets around the world.",
      "On Thursday, the World Bank also warned that US tariffs could hit trade and depress global growth this year.",
      "The bank predicts global growth of 2.7% in 2025, which would be the weakest performance since 2019, aside from the sharp contraction seen at the height of the Covid pandemic."

      "Speaking on LBC Radio, she said the UK had a poor record in prioritising assistance to those who need it the most.",
      "Her comments, in response to a question about the state pension, led other parties to accuse her of wanting to water down the \"triple lock\" uprating policy.",
      "A Tory spokesman denied this was on the cards, accusing Labour and the Liberal Democrats of misrepresenting her.",
      "He added that the party would \"look at means testing\" - but did not specify which benefits would be in scope.",
      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "Why do politicians keep talking about locks?",
      "During a phone-in on LBC, Badenoch said the UK, like other Western nations, faced a \"structural problem\" because people were living longer while having fewer children.",
      "She added that \"serious thinking\" was required to address the financial impact of more government spending \"on later life\".",
      "Asked whether this included the \"triple lock\" policy - under which state pension payments go up every year by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5% - she replied: \"That's exactly the sort of thing that the policy work we are going to be doing will look at\".",
      "But pressed on whether her party would really look at the \"triple lock\", she then added: \"No, we are going to look at means-testing\".",

      "A Tory spokesman denied this, adding the party had \"always protected the triple lock\" and accusing Labour of \"skewing her words for political gain\".",
      "However, the party has yet to clarify which benefits it would consider subjecting to means-testing, when the level of support is linked in some way to a claimant's income or wealth.",
      "Current benefits paid in this way include housing benefit, Universal Credit and pension credit, a top-up paid to poorer pensioners.",
      "Speaking later on Sky News, Tory co-chair Nigel Huddleston did not clarify the party's position either, but said it wanted to look at a \"whole bunch of policy areas\".",
      "It is not the first time Badenoch has been embroiled in a row over comments made during media appearances.",
      "As a Tory leadership candidate last September, she appeared to suggest maternity pay was \"excessive\" before later arguing she was making a more general point about the burden of regulations on business.",
      "'Unsustainable'",
      "Originally a Lib Dem manifesto commitment in the 2010 general election, the state pension triple lock was embraced by the Conservatives when the two parties entered office as a coalition government.",
      "It has since has been in place ever since, save for a temporary suspension during the Covid pandemic, and has also been adopted by Labour.",
      "At the last election, Rishi Sunak pledged to strengthen the uprating policy further by applying it to pensioners' income tax thresholds too.",
      "However some economists have questioned whether the policy is financially sustainable given increasing life expectancy. Others have questioned whether it is fair, given working-age benefits do not increase in the same way.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride has argued the policy is \"unsustainable\" in the \"very, very long term\".",
      "Since taking office Labour has decided to means-test the winter fuel payment, a \u00a3200-\u00a3300 pension supplement that was previously paid to all pensioners, by linking eligibility to pension credit.",
      "Badenoch said she opposed that decision, arguing it would mean pensioners \"on the breadline\" would miss out. She added, however, that she supported the idea it should not go to \"millionaires\".",
      "Writing later on X, Badenoch said the government needed \"better mechanisms\" to target support, instead of using \"proxies\" such as eligibility for pension credit or free school meals."

      "In her first major speech of 2025, Badenoch attacked the Labour's government but also her own party for repeatedly pledging to lower immigration as numbers \"kept going up\" and for promising net zero carbon emissions by 2050 without a clear plan.",
      "Badenoch pledged to tell hard truths \"even when it's difficult to hear\" to restore trust with the public.",

      "\"We made it the law that we would deliver net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And only then did we start thinking about how we would do that.",
      "\"We announced that we would lower immigration, but immigration kept going up.",

      "But she admitted she left office with unfinished work.",

      "\"Those options were presented to us, time and time again by officials, and we rejected them time and time again because they would hurt so many people for so little benefit.\"",
      "Badenoch, who was elected Tory leader in November, has previously said she will focus on rebuilding voters' trust before announcing her own policies.",
      "In her November victory speech, Badenoch promised to \"renew\" the party by returning the Conservatives to \"first principles\".",
      "Responding to her latest comments, Ellie Reeves said: \"The public rightly lost trust in the Conservatives after 14 long years of failure in government.\"",

      "Amesbury, who represents Runcorn and Helsby, pleaded guilty to assaulting the 45-year-old Paul Fellows at Chester Magistrates' Court.",
      "He had been suspended from the Labour Party after the footage appeared of the fracas, which occurred in Frodsham, Cheshire, at 02:45 GMT on 26 October last year.",
      "The video, which did not show the lead up to the altercation, recorded Amesbury shouting: \"You won't threaten the MP ever again, will you?\"",
      "Alison Storey, prosecuting, told the court how, at about 02:00, Mr Fellows was in Frodsham town centre and went to a taxi rank.",
      "He was alone and had been drinking, she said.",
      "Ms Storey said: \"Mr Amesbury arrived at the same taxi rank. He too was alone and he too had been drinking.\"",
      "The court heard Mr Fellows recognised Amesbury and approached him to remonstrate about a bridge closure in the town.",
      "She said CCTV showed an engagement between them over a period of several minutes, but with no aggression or raised voices.",
      "She said: \"At one point Mr Fellows started to walk away but was re-engaged by Mr Amesbury.\"",
      "Amesbury, 55, was then heard to say \"what\" a few times before shouting it, the court heard.",
      "Ms Storey said Mr Fellows put his hands in his pockets and turned towards the taxi queue but, when he turned back, Amesbury punched him to the head, knocking him to the ground.",
      "He followed him on to the road after he fell and started to punch him again at least five times, she said.",

      "It was passed in 2023, but was opposed by victims' groups and all the main political parties in Northern Ireland.",
      "The act created a new legacy body known as the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to take over all Troubles-era cases from 1 May 2024, including those on the desk of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).",

      "Labour pledged to repeal the Legacy Act if they won the general election in July and formally began that process in December.",
      "Why could Gerry Adams seek compensation?",
      "A Supreme Court judgement in 2020 paved the way for Mr Adams to receive damages after it quashed his convictions over two attempted prison break-outs.",
      "It ruled his detention was unlawful because the interim custody order (ICO) had not been \"considered personally\" by the then Northern Ireland Secretary Willie Whitelaw.",
      "At the time, the Conservative government argued the ICOs were lawful due to a convention known as the Carltona principle, where officials and junior ministers routinely act in the name of a secretary of state.",

    "story": [
      "If you were to produce a political heat map of the government right now, there is one big bit that would be bright red, and probably flashing: the Treasury.",
      "Firstly, there have been all of the headlines about the now former Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Tulip Siddiq.",
      "For all of the complexities and subtleties of this story, and there are plenty, the inescapable crux of it was something even the most polished public relations executive would struggle to add much gloss to.",
      "The minister responsible for the government's anti-corruption drive was named in a corruption investigation.",
      "Awkward.",
      "It is vital to stress Tulip Siddiq has always insisted she has done nothing wrong and the prime minister's independent adviser on ministerial standards concluded she had not broken the ministerial code.",

      "And what are the responsibilities of the economic secretary to the Treasury?",
      "Well, tackling economic crime, money laundering and illicit finance among other things.",
      "And remember, politics isn't a court of law, but a court of perceptions \u2013 where unanswered questions are dangerous because they amount to more headlines, however fair or otherwise that might be.",
      "The independent adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, concluded that \"given the nature of Ms Siddiq's ministerial responsibilities... it is regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks.\"",
      "And, he added: \"I would not advise that this shortcoming should be taken as a breach of the ministerial code, but you will want to consider her ongoing responsibilities in the light of this.\"",
      "Oh dear.",

      "Let's turn next to the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has also struggled to get herself out of the headlines.",

      "The dip in inflation in the latest figures just published are better than the alternative for Rachel Reeves - albeit the rate at which prices are rising is still higher than the target the Bank of England aims for.",

    "story": [
      "Government borrowing costs have been steadily rising in recent months, and have now hit their highest levels for several years.",
      "Why is this happening and how does it affect you?",
      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the past few days. On 7 January it was worth $1.25 but it has now fallen to just above $1.21.",
      "Why are bond yields rising?",
      "Yields are rising not just in the UK. Borrowing costs have also been going up in the US, Japan, Germany and France, for instance.",
      "There is a great deal of uncertainty around what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. He has pledged to bring in tariffs on goods entering the US and to cut taxes.",
      "Investors worry that this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as they had expected.",
      "But in the UK there are also concerns about the economy underperforming.",
      "Inflation is at its highest for eight months - hitting 2.6% in November - above the Bank of England's 2% target - while the economy has shrunk for two months in a row.",
      "Analysts say it is these wider concerns about the strength of the economy that is driving down the pound, which typically rises when borrowing costs increase.",
      "However, the dollar is also rising against all currencies - not just the pound.",
      "The US economy created more jobs than forecast last month which has added to expectations that US rates will remain higher than previously forecast, and this has helped to push up the value of the dollar.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",
      "Although yields are higher now than they were then, they have been creeping up slowly over a period of months, whereas in 2022 they shot up over a couple of days.",
      "That speedy rise led to lenders quickly pulling deals while they tried to work out what interest rate to charge.",
      "Analysts and brokers say the current unease in the markets is having some effect on the pricing of mortgages. Many were expecting to see some falls in rates at the start of the year but instead lenders are holding off from cuts to see what happens.",
      "However, the market is favourable to anyone currently buying an annuity - a product from an insurance company that gives a retirement income for the rest of their life, bought only once.",
      "One annuity expert told the BBC many people would get a better deal now than at any time since 2008, because annuity rates usually move in line with gilt yields.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "What happens next?",
      "The Treasury has said there is no need for an emergency intervention in the financial markets.",
      "It has said it will not make any spending or tax announcements ahead of the official borrowing forecast from its independent watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), due on 26 March.",
      "If the OBR says the chancellor is still on track to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules then that might settle the markets.",
      "However, if the OBR were to say because of slower growth and higher-than-expected interest rates, the chancellor were likely to break her fiscal rules then that would potentially be a problem for Reeves.",

      "A third of the ancient city still lies hidden beneath volcanic debris from the disaster, but the new excavation - the most extensive in a generation - provides new insights into ancient Roman life.",
      "The archaeologists have been followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig.",
      "An entire block of Pompeii has now been uncovered, revealing a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house. It's thought these were all owned by one wealthy individual, possibly Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.",
      "The discovery of the bathhouse is further confirmation of his elite status, says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"",
      "Those lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.",
      "They would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.",
      "Next they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.",
      "Finally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.",
      "\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "The bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.",
      "A huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.",
      "The residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.",
      "Next door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.",
      "The skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.",
      "\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",
      "Analysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.",
      "The woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.",
      "\"She was probably someone higher up in society,\" says Dr Hay. \"She could have been the wife of the owner of the house - or maybe an assistant looking after the wife, we just don't know.\"",
      "An assortment of items were found on a marble table top in the room - glassware, bronze jugs and pottery - perhaps brought into the room where the pair had tucked themselves away hoping to wait out the eruption.",
      "But it's the items clutched by the victims that are of particular interest. The younger man held some keys, while the older woman was found with gold and silver coins and jewellery.",
      "These are kept in Pompeii's vault, along with the city's other priceless finds, and we were given a chance to see them with archaeologist, Dr Alessandro Russo.",
      "The gold coins still gleam as if they were new, and he shows us delicate gold and natural pearl earrings, necklace pendants and intricately etched semi-precious stones.",
      "\"When we find this kind of object, the distance from ancient times and modern times disappears,\" Dr Russo says, \"and we can touch a small piece of the life of these people who died in the eruption.\"",
      "Dr Sophie Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also sheds more light on a darker side of Roman life.",
      "Just behind the hot room is a boiler room. A pipe brought water in from the street - with some syphoned off into the cold plunge pool - and the rest was heated in a lead boiler destined for the hot room. The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.",
      "With a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.",
      "\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.",
      "\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.",
      "\"A wall is all that could divide you between two different worlds.\"",
      "The excavation is in its final weeks - but new discoveries continue to emerge from the ash. Limited numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the dig while it's ongoing, but eventually it will be fully opened to the public.",
      "\"Every day here is a surprise,\" says Dr Anna Onesti, director of the excavation.",
      "\"Sometimes in the morning I come to work thinking that it's a normal working day - and then I discover we found something exceptional.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 23:05:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Wild tigers killed nearly 40 people in Nepal between 2019 and 2023. Solutions are hard to come by.",
    "story": [
      "Nepal has been celebrated globally for tripling its tiger population in a decade - but Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli thinks the country may have been too successful.",
      "\"In such a small country, we have more than 350 tigers\u2026 We can't have so many tigers and let them eat up humans,\" he said last month at an event organised to review the country's COP29 outcomes.",
      "Attacks by tigers claimed nearly 40 lives and injured 15 people between 2019 and 2023, according to government data. But local communities say the figure is much higher.",
      "\"For us, 150 tigers are enough,\" Oli declared in December, even suggesting that Nepal could send its prized big cats to other countries as gifts.",
      "How many tigers are too many?",
      "There is no one answer, experts say. It depends on the availability of prey in a given area -  ideally, each tiger should be in the vicinity of about 500 prey animals, such as deer, antelopes or wild buffalo, tiger biologist Ullas Karanth says.",
      "Experts argue that Oli's concern with capping tiger numbers is misplaced. Rather, Nepal's government should focus on \"expanding protected areas that have reasonable natural densities of prey and tigers,\" Dr Karanth adds.",
      "If wildlife is spilling out of protected areas in search of prey, that might explain why so many attacks have happened in places that border forests, where tigers have always encountered humans.",
      "An example is the \"buffer zones\" that lie between national parks and human settlements. Wildlife sightings are common here, but locals also use the area for cattle-grazing and collecting fodder and firewood.",
      "Forest corridors - strips of land that connect different parks and bio-reserves allowing wildlife to roam between them - have emerged as yet another flashpoint. Roads sometimes run through these areas, and locals also use them for foraging, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.",
      "The rise in human fatalities is a sign that Nepal's once-successful conservation model is cracking, zoologist Karan Shah says.",
      "\"So far, [Nepal's] focus seems to be on winning international attention, while ignoring the impact on communities living around national parks and protected areas,\" Mr Shah adds.",
      "He argues that conservation is not just \"an ecological or scientific issue\" but also a social one - and that the loss of human lives must be prevented so local communities remain a part of the conservation effort and don't turn against it. Anger among locals has also been growing as tigers have been preying on livestock.",
      "\"A significant portion of our population still live in rural areas and are dependent on forest resources that they help conserve - but they are now increasingly being killed and injured by tigers,\" Thakur Bhandari, president of Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal, told the BBC.",
      "\"As forest conservationists we cannot be against wildlife, but that does not mean we should ignore its impact on humans and our society.\"",
      "A success story turned deadly",
      "A century ago, some 100,000 tigers roamed Asia - but deforestation and rampant poaching pushed them to the brink of extinction. There are now only about 5,600 wild tigers remaining across 13 countries, including Nepal, China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia.",
      "All of these nations had committed to doubling their tiger numbers by 2022, but Nepal was the first to surpass the target - due in part to a zero-poaching initiative and a doubling of the country's forest cover between 1992 and 2016.",
      "Connecting 16 protected zones in southern Nepal with areas across the border in northern India created forest corridors which helped too.",
      "The growing number of tiger attacks has now tarnished that achievement.",
      "Oli believes Nepal's tiger population is growing at the cost of human lives. Viable solutions, however, are not easy to come by.",
      "The parks and wildlife department has acknowledged the challenge of managing tigers in Nepal, where those that kill humans are tracked down and taken into captivity.",
      "\"Zoos and rescue centres are already overwhelmed with problematic tigers,\" the department said in a conservation report published in 2023. \"A comprehensive protocol is urgently needed to cope with the rescue, handling, and rehabilitation of problem animals.\"",
      "Oli has proposed sending Nepal's tigers abroad.",
      "\"People love to keep birds like falcons and peacocks as pets, so why not tigers?\" he suggested. \"That would boost their status too.\"",
      "Others have different ideas.",
      "Dr Karanth says tigers that have repeatedly taken human lives should be \"killed immediately\". Some argue that humans exacerbated the problem by encroaching into the tigers' natural habitats, using the land for cultivation or infrastructure and reducing the big cats' prey-base.",
      "The BBC spoke to a wildlife management expert, meanwhile, who claims Oli wants to bring down tiger numbers so that more land can be cleared to build infrastructure.",
      "\"It is not about people's safety,\" he said.",
      "For now the situation is at an impasse. It's unclear whether Oli's \"tiger diplomacy\" suggestion will gain traction, or whether over-encroaching humans or tigers are to blame for Nepal's tiger attack crisis.",
      "What is clear is that humans and tigers are struggling to achieve peaceful co-existence in Nepal - and the country's conservation success story has brought many of its own thorny problems to reckon with.",

    "story": [
      "Women in Britain 2,000 years ago appear to have passed on land and wealth to daughters not sons as communities were built around women's blood lines, according to new research.",
      "Skeletons unearthed in Dorset contained DNA evidence that Celtic men moved to live with their wives' families and communities.",
      "Scientists found evidence of a whole community built around the female line of a family over generations, probably originating with one woman.",
      "\"This points to an Iron Age society in Britain where women wielded quite a lot of influence and could shape its trajectory in many ways,\" says Dr Lara Cassidy at Trinity College, Dublin, lead author of the research.",
      "It is the first time this evidence of communities being built around women has been documented in ancient European history.",
      "The scientists believe that the communities also invested a lot in their daughters as they would probably inherit their mother's status.",
      "\"It's relatively rare in modern societies, but this might not always have been the case,\" says Dr Cassidy.",
      "The team found evidence that it happened in numerous places in Britain, suggesting it was widespread.",
      "The communities analysed lived around the same time as Boudica, the warrior Queen who led a rebellion against Roman invaders in East Anglia around AD 61.",
      "Dr Cassidy sequenced DNA taken from the bones of 57 individuals from a tribe called the Durotriges. The people lived in Winterborne Kingston, Dorset around 100 BC to AD 100.",
      "The skeletons were dug up from a cemetery by a team of archaeologists at Bournemouth University.",
      "By tracing mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed on by women, Dr Cassidy found that most women in the community were related by blood dating back generations.",
      "By contrast, there was a lot of diversity in the Y chromosomes, which is passed from father to son, indicating that men from lots of different families married into the community.",
      "The DNA analysis also indicates that most of the ancestral line could be traced back to a single woman.",
      "The work indicates that this society was what is known as matrilocal - meaning that a married man moved to live in his wife's community.",

      "The researchers found the same matrilocality evidence in bones from other cemeteries including in Cornwall and Yorkshire.",
      "She says that evidence of powerful women in ancient communities has often been dismissed an a one-off, not the norm, but these findings challenge that thinking.",
      "Archaeologists Prof Miles Russell and Prof Martin Smith found other evidence that women had high status.",

      "The findings also back up Roman writings at the time which suggested that women in Britain were quite powerful, more so than in Rome.",
      "But Romans like Julius Caeser viewed that as a sign of backwardness.",
      "\"Women in Britain had power and it was a more egalitarian place. That was the biggest problem that Romans had with the Britons because Rome was a deeply patriarchal society. To them, it marked Britons as the ultimate Barbarians,\" says Professor Miles Russell at Bournemouth University.",

      "On Thursday morning, scientists began by gradually reducing the speed of the two spacecraft - bringing them ever closer until they were just 3 metres apart. Then their connectors were latched together.",
      "In the next step, the two spacecraft were screwed on perfectly, creating an airtight passage for safe transfer of material or crew, completing space docking.",
      "An Isro official told the BBC that over the next two-three days, the mission will carry out what is being billed as one of its most important experiments - it will transfer electrical power from the Chaser to Target.",
      "This, Ms Mitra, says is to demonstrate that a spacecraft can be sent to service another in space.",
      "The experiment will then demonstrate \"undocking and separation of the two satellites\".",
      "Ms Mitra says the mission will also test India's capabilities for inter-satellite communication as during the docking and undocking, the spacecraft will have to communicate with the Earth station and also with each other so that they know each other's position and velocity.",
      "The spacecraft are also carrying scientific instruments and cameras which will then be deployed. Over the next two years, they will measure radiation in space and monitor natural resources on Earth.",

      "And if it can, at what cost? Because some experts are concerned that certain potential risks are being overlooked amid the enthusiasm to reap the benefits - and to win back the lead.",
      "A crazy idea 'that works'",
      "Prof Stephen Wallace from the University of Edinburgh is among those turning the fatbergs into perfumes. \"It's a crazy idea,\" he admits to me, \"but it works.\"",
      "Fatbergs are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste that people put down their drains. Prof Wallace gets his from a company that specialises in fishing them out of sewers and turning them into biofuels. They arrive at the lab in a tube.",
      "The first step is to sterilise the material in a steamer. Prof Wallace then adds the specially modified bacteria to the remnants of the fatberg. The bacteria have a short section of DNA inserted, to give the bacteria their particular properties.",
      "The fatberg gradually disappears, as the bacteria eat it, producing the chemical with the pine-like smell - this can be used as an ingredient in perfumes.",
      "Prof Wallace says that while the UK has taken a lead role in establishing the technology, it now needs to show it can go to the next step. \"We are at this nervous point where the core technology that enables a huge range of sustainable industrial technologies is established and we are now progressing to the stage of scaling up to manufacturing.",
      "\"But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Tech advances at break-neck speed",
      "If the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels.",
      "But while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure.",
      "One of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals.",
      "\"Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,\" she tells me. \"It's an extremely fast-moving field.\"",
      "One member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements.",
      "The possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things.",
      "However all those possibilities require funding.",
      "A national priority?",
      "The technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of \u00a32bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment.",
      "On the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain.",
      "The chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this.",
      "\"We are looking for products like this handbag,\" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research.",
      "Modern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe.",
      "\"They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,\" she continues.",
      "\"Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.\"",
      "Losing out to Korea and the US",
      "In the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses.",
      "In all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas.",
      "The fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a new House of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons.",
      "It states that \"other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector\".",
      "How Biden tarnished his own legacy",
      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "The report also says that there is a \"small but closing window\" to make some small policy tweaks that could make a huge difference, such as recommitting to the target set out in the National Vision for at least \u00a32 billion of funding over the next decade.",
      "Professor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, \"we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea\".",
      "She said: \"We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria.",
      "\"If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brain drain",
      "Dr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government.",
      "\"The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.\"",
      "According to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK.",
      "\"All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,\" she says. \"This requires urgent action\".",
      "Another issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (\u00a382m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (\u00a3614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism.",
      "\"Our biofoundry in London had \u00a37m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash\".",
      "Not all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money.",
      "'Living pollution' that could spread",
      "A further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat.",
      "\"Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.\"",
      "In response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office.",
      "But \"streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances\", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits.",
      "Many applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for.",
      "But Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. \"There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants.",
      "\"This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences\".",
      "Inadvertent creation of superbugs",
      "Scientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks.",
      "Most worrisome is the inadvertent creation of superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.",
      "A group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of \"mirror life\", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts.",
      "Writing in the journal Science, they said that these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks.",
      "But the problem is that the technology has become so cheap and widely available that such a moratorium would be hard to police. And while the creation of mirror life is a highly specialised skill, bad actors could make simpler changes, increasing the risk of bioterrorism.",
      "Government and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way.",
      "Prof Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. \"We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public.",
      "\"The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology\".",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 04:34:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Pigs, donkeys and even a mini cow named Cuddles found a temporary home after the LA fires.",
    "story": [
      "The trailers arrived all at once, carrying hundreds of horses fleeing the Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles.",
      "Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed.",
      "Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters.",
      "The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.",
      "Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies.",
      "Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened.",
      "A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from the Eaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped.",
      "His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air.",
      "One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured.",
      "\"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\"",
      "Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables.",
      "Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities.",
      "Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides.",
      "\"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\"",
      "But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.",
      "So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy.",
      "Watching owners reunite with their horses was one of the most valuable experiences for volunteers, said London Scott, founder of the local Cali Cowboy Club.",
      "\"It's a really beautiful process to go through,\" Ms Scott said, \"To be able to see that at first hand, and know that you had a small part in someone having a little peace of mind in a tragic moment in time.\"",
      "Those here describe a deep bond to their animals and say the farms that burned down are a place of peace in this bustling metropolitan area.",
      "\"They are my safe place,\" Catherine Armenta, 42, said. \"It's like a bond, a connection that I don't really have with anything else on this planet.\"",
      "Many of those here don't know what happens next, where they might take their animals after the chaos of the ongoing fires burning around the Los Angeles region ends.",
      "\"I haven't been able to even process any of this. There's 40 horses to take care of,\" Ms Bacon said. \"When everything is said and done, I think we're all gonna go get margaritas and just have a good cry.\""

    "summary": "Nine in 10 new cars in the country are now battery-powered, and it aims to hit 100% later this year.",
    "story": [
      "Norway is the world leader when it comes to the take up of electric cars, which last year accounted for nine out of 10 new vehicles sold in the country. Can other nations learn from it?",
      "For more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars.",
      "Now all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV).",
      "\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"",
      "On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.",
      "The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.",
      "Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.",
      "And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.",
      "In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.",
      "By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.",
      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",
      "Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.",
      "\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.",
      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",
      "Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.",
      "For many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.",
      "\"With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,\" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital.",
      "\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"",
      "Another driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"",
      "At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.",
      "This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.",
      "That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.",
      "Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.",
      "Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports.",
      "Ms Bu says there's \"not really any reason why other countries can not copy Norway\". However, she adds that it is \"all about doing it in a way that can work in each country or market\".",
      "Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. \"I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible.\"",
      "Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel.",
      "The country also has an abundance of renewable hydro electricity, which accounts for 88% of its production capacity.",
      "\"A third of cars are now electric, and it will pass 50% in a few years,\" says Kjell Werner Johansen from the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research. \"I think the government accepts that a few new petrol or hybrid cars will still be on the market, but I don't know anybody who wants to buy a diesel car these days.\"",

      "TikTok has said it will be forced to \"go dark\" in the US on Sunday unless the government intervenes before a ban takes effect.",
      "In a statement late on Friday, it said the White House and the Department of Justice had \"failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability\".",
      "It said that unless the government immediately stepped in to assure the video app it would not be punished for violating the looming ban, it would be \"forced to go dark on January 19\".",
      "The statement follows a Supreme Court ruling earlier on Friday which upheld a law banning the app in the US unless its China-based parent company, ByteDance, sells the platform by Sunday.",

      "It had been thought the ban would not impact TikTok users who already have the app downloaded on their phones.",
      "But given updates would become unavailable once the ban comes into force, the app would eventually degrade and become unusable over time.",
      "TikTok's fresh statement on Friday, however, suggests it may immediately become unavailable to all existing users as well as those seeking to download it.",

    "story": [
      "TikTok is set to be banned in the US on 19 January after the Supreme Court denied a last ditch legal bid from its Chinese owner, ByteDance.",
      "It found the law banning the social media platform did not violate the first amendment rights of TikTok and its 170 million users, as the companies argued.",
      "But will the decision of the country's highest judicial authority actually stop Americans using it?",

      "So what happens next?",
      "Can Trump overturn the ban?",
      "Trump may once have sought to ban TikTok - but he has repeatedly indicated during 2024 that he is now firmly against the law, and tried unsuccessfully to get it delayed.",
      "Despite the court's ruling, in an interview with CNN, he has insisted TikTok's future rests with him - even if he gave no indication of what his decision on the future of the social media platform would be.",
      "On social media he indicated his next steps might take some time to work out.",
      "\"The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it,\" he wrote.",
      "\"My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation.\"",
      "Before that interview he has made it clear however he would be seeking what he previously called a \"political solution.\"",
      "On Friday, just before the court released its ruling, he said he spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok, as well as issues around trade.",
      "\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately,\" he posted on social media.",
      "And on Thursday Trump's incoming national security advised Mike Waltz told Fox News the president-elect was looking for ways to \"preserve\" TikTok, saying Americans' access to the platform and their data would be preserved.",
      "\"I don't want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we're going to create the space to put that deal in place,\" Mr Waltz said.",
      "The Biden administration has made clear they will not enforce the law - so another option would be for Trump to follow suit and allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to ignore it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow people to download TikTok onto their devices, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment.",
      "Can people still use TikTok even if it's banned?",
      "If Trump can't unban TikTok, then what happens?",

      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?",
      "Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "But because the app most likely won't be publicly available anymore, new updates will no longer be delivered to users in the US - which will make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable.",
      "Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target.",
      "Of course, there are ways around such a ban.",
      "There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region.",
      "The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements.",
      "It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks.",
      "However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app.",
      "So if the ban ends up taking this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will still be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "However there are other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",
      "TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US.",
      "Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said the complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next.",
      "But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself.",
      "\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\" he said.",
      "Who could buy TikTok?",
      "Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table.",
      "But could that change now that it has actually been banned - and what will happen when a president who prides himself on \"the art of the deal\" returns to the White House?",
      "Potential buyers continue to line up - with Bloomberg News reporting on Tuesday that the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, though TikTok has since described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.",
      "There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December."

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 00:09:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Should more AI be used to help GPs with consultations and administrative work?",
    "story": [
      "This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Could AI help prevent diabetes-related sight loss?",
      "Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI.",
      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",
      "She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation.",
      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

      "The security cabinet earlier recommended ratifying the agreement, saying it \"supports the achievement of the objectives of the war\", according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.",
      "The terms of the agreement will officially come into force at 08:30 local time (06:30 GMT) on Sunday, Qatari mediators announced.",

      "Gazans anxiously await ceasefire, fearing last-minute catastrophes",
      "Bowen: Israel has changed since Donald Trump's last term \u2013 has he?",
      "Under the deal, 33 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza after 15 months of conflict will be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails during the first phase lasting six weeks.",
      "Israeli forces will also withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, displaced Palestinians will be allowed to begin returning to their homes and hundreds of aid lorries will be allowed into the territory each day.",
      "Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and \"the restoration of sustainable calm\" - will start on the 16th day.",
      "The third and final stage will involve the reconstruction of Gaza - something which could take years - and the return of any remaining hostages' bodies.",
      "Qatar has said the hostages to be released during the first phase will include \"civilian women, female soldiers, children, the elderly, and sick and wounded civilians\".",
      "Israel says three hostages are expected to be released on the first day of the ceasefire, with more small groups freed at regular intervals over the next six weeks.",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and others - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.",
      "More than 46,870 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to a struggle to get aid to those in need.",
      "Israel says 94 of the hostages are still being held by Hamas, of whom 34 are presumed dead. In addition, there are four Israelis who were abducted before the war, two of whom are dead.",
      "Ahead of the Israeli government's vote on the deal, Culture Minister Miki Zohar of Netanyahu's Likud party said: \"It's a very hard decision, but we decided to support it because it's very important to us to see all of our children, men and women back home.\"",
      "\"We hope that in the future we will be able to finish the job in Gaza,\" he added.",
      "But far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he was \"horrified\" by the details of the agreement, including that \"life-sentenced terrorists\" would be released in exchange for the hostages, and urged other ministers to join him in voting against it.",
      "On Thursday, Ben-Gvir announced that his Jewish Power party would leave the governing coalition if the deal was approved. But he said he would not bring down the government in parliament and would return \"if the war against Hamas resumes with full force\".",
      "Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, another far-right politician who opposed the deal, has said his Religious Zionism party will quit if the war does not resume after the first phase ends.",
      "The three-phase structure has also caused division and anxiety among some of the hostages' families. They fear their relatives will be abandoned in Gaza after the first phase is done and are urging the government to ensure the second and third phases are also implemented.",
      "\"For 469 days our loved ones have been abandoned in captivity, and now, finally, there's hope,\" said Einav Zangauker, whose 25-year-old son Matan was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz.",
      "\"This agreement must be followed through to the end, to bring everyone home and end the war. Ending the war, returning everyone and returning to normalcy is in Israel's interest.\"",
      "The government vote had been expected on Thursday, but the meeting was delayed after Netanyahu accused Hamas of reneging on parts of the deal - an allegation Hamas denied.",
      "In the early hours of Friday, the prime minister's office announced that the Israeli negotiating team in Doha had finalised the agreement.",
      "Hamas also put out a statement which said the \"obstacles\" that emerged in relation to the terms of the deal had been resolved at dawn.",
      "A source close to Hamas told AFP news agency that the first three hostages to be released would be women.",
      "On Friday, the Israeli justice ministry published a list of 95 Palestinian prisoners which it said would be part of the first group to be freed in exchange for hostages. They comprised 69 women, 16 men and 10 minors, according to AFP.",
      "Friday also saw a meeting held in Cairo to discuss mechanisms for implementing the deal, a senior Egyptian official told the BBC.",
      "All necessary arrangements were agreed, including the formation of a joint operations room to ensure compliance, that would include Egyptian, Qatari, US, Palestinian and Israeli representatives, the official said.",
      "Egyptian state-run Al-Qahera News TV also cited a source as saying that they had agreed on facilitating the entry of 600 aid lorries per day during the ceasefire.",
      "That would require a more than 14-fold increase from January's UN-reported daily average of 43 lorries. But Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization's Gaza representative, said \"the possibility is very much there\" if the Rafah crossing with Egypt and other crossings opened.",
      "The WHO also plans to deliver a number of prefabricated hospitals to support the devastated healthcare sector. Half of Gaza's 36 hospitals are not functional, while the others are only partially functional.",
      "There has been no respite for Palestinians on the ground in Gaza since the ceasefire deal was announced on Wednesday night.",

    "story": [
      "The Israeli and Hamas negotiators never came face to face - but by the end, just one floor separated them.",
      "Ceasefire talks via middlemen from Qatar, Egypt and the US had been dragging on for several months, at times without hope. Now the key players were all inside one building in Doha and the pace was frantic.",
      "A deal was close but things had gone wrong before: one source described a last-minute push to stop the agreement breaking down while a podium was being set up so the Qatari prime minister could announce it.",
      "\"Literally, negotiations were up until 10 minutes before the press conference. So that's how things were stitched up at the last minute,\" the source familiar with the talks said.",
      "The BBC has spoken to a number of officials on all sides of the negotiations to piece together how the final fraught days of the secretive process unfolded.",
      "Shifting ground",
      "The deal did not come out of the blue.",
      "The overall framework of the agreement reached on 15 January was broadly the same as the proposal set out by President Joe Biden during a White House address last May. It uses the same three-phase approach and will see a ceasefire, Israeli hostages released in return for Palestinian prisoners, and the Israeli military's gradual withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "But sources familiar with the discussions agreed the dynamics of the talks shifted decisively in mid-December and the pace changed.",
      "Hamas, already reeling from Israel's killing of its leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza two months earlier, had become increasingly isolated. Its Lebanon-based ally Hezbollah had been decimated and had agreed to a truce with Israel. Bashar al-Assad's Iran-backed government in Syria had also been swept away.",
      "The view in Washington is that Hamas was forced to abandon the idea that \"the cavalry was coming to save it\", as one US official put it.",
      "\"It is hard to overstate how fundamentally the equation changed and what that [did] for Hamas's calculus,\" says a senior Biden administration official familiar with the talks.",
      "An Israeli official who wished to remain anonymous said Hamas was \"not in a rush\" to strike a deal and had been \"dictating\" rather than negotiating. They said that changed after the death of Sinwar and Israeli operations against Hamas's allies in the region.",
      "On top of that, the official said, there was \"momentum created by both US administrations\" - the Biden White House and the incoming Trump team.",
      "\"We could not achieve a deal like this until conditions had changed,\" the official added.",
      "On 12 December, Biden's negotiating team visited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Middle East envoy Brett McGurk and CIA director Bill Burns were all in attendance.",
      "A US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the meeting lasted \"multiple hours\" and focused on the \"new regional equation\" and \"how we catapult from the Lebanon ceasefire into another round of intensive discussions\" on Gaza.",

      "Gazans anxiously await ceasefire, fearing last-minute catastrophes",
      "Bowen: Israel has changed since Donald Trump's last term \u2013 has he?",
      "There was also another piece on the chessboard by this stage: Donald Trump.",
      "On 16 December, weeks after Trump's victory, the BBC spoke to a Hamas official who was unusually optimistic about the ceasefire efforts, suggesting they seemed to be more serious.",
      "The official - who had taken part in every set of talks since November 2023 - appeared reassured by the fact that an adviser to the incoming US president had sent a message to mediators indicating Trump wanted an agreement before his inauguration.",
      "Trump had also warned of \"all hell to pay\" if Hamas did not agree to release the hostages - but the Palestinian official was bullish.",
      "\"This time, the pressure will not be limited to Hamas, as was customary under the Biden administration,\" the official said. \"There will also be pressure on Netanyahu. He is the one obstructing the deal, and Trump seems to understand that very well.\"",
      "False dawns",
      "However, that same official's prediction that a deal could be done by Christmas proved to be optimistic.",
      "During December, the process remained beset by problems. Israel publicly ruled out releasing certain high-profile prisoners, while the White House accused Hamas of throwing up roadblocks over the hostage releases.",
      "A Biden administration official said: \"Hamas [was] refusing to agree - and this was a breakdown at that point - to the list of hostages that would be released in phase one of the deal.",
      "\"That's just so fundamental. This is a hostage release deal. Unless you agree to the list of hostages who will come out, there's not going to be a deal.\"",
      "The same official said Hamas made \"completely untrue\" claims about not knowing the location of the hostages, and added: \"We held the line and basically left the table until Hamas agreed to the hostage list.\"",
      "An anonymous Israeli official said Hamas had sought to conceal the number of living hostages and \"tried to dictate that they would send us only dead bodies\".",
      "For its part, Hamas claimed Israel unexpectedly added 11 names to the list of hostages it wanted to be released in the first phase. Hamas considered them reserve soldiers, and therefore not eligible to be released alongside the women, injured and elderly hostages due to be released in phase one.",
      "The door was left open to Qatari and Egyptian mediators to continue their efforts and on 3 January, there was an apparent breakthrough when Hamas proposed the release of 110 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in return.",
      "There were by now well-established terms of reference for such trades. For each hostage Hamas was to release, Israel would have to provide what had become known in the nomenclature of the draft deal as a \"key\" - meaning an agreed number or even specific identities of Palestinian prisoners.",
      "A US official said: \"There's an equation for how many Palestinian prisoners come out. So for female soldiers, for example, there's a key. And for elderly males, there's a key. And for women civilians, there's a key. And this has all been worked out and the prisoners have been named, hundreds and hundreds of prisoners on the list.\"",
      "The exchange file in the negotiations - Palestinian prisoners for hostages held by Hamas - became known as \"the keys\".",
      "During this phase of the talks, Hamas also relented on two long-standing demands: the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza in the first phase and a formal Israeli commitment to a total ceasefire.",
      "Sensing a breakthrough, the Egyptian mediator urgently dispatched Major General Ahmed Abdel Khaleq - who oversees the Palestinian portfolio in Egyptian intelligence - to Doha. After meeting with Hamas representatives, he secured confirmation the group would make what a senior Hamas official described as \"painful concessions.\"",
      "But on 6 January, according to a Palestinian official, Israel rejected the offer put forward by Hamas on the 11 hostages. Hamas responded by sending the BBC and other media outlets a list featuring the names and ages of 34 Israeli hostages. Two days later, the body of one of those on that list - Yosef\u00a0AlZayadni - was found inside Gaza.",
      "The list included reserve soldiers, which indicated Hamas was willing to release them in the first phase.",
      "This appeared to be an attempt to embarrass Netanyahu and rally hostage families in Israel and around the world to pressure him into accepting the deal.",
      "It was also an indication Hamas had not walked away.",
      "Metres apart",
      "Meetings stretching into the small hours of Doha's hot evenings became common during the final stretch of the negotiations.",
      "In the last month, they had developed into so-called \"proximity talks\", with both sides in the same two-storey building, according to multiple accounts from officials familiar with the details.",
      "A senior US official said Hamas's delegation was on the first floor and Israel's on the floor above. Mediators ran pieces of paper between them. Maps of Israeli troop withdrawal proposals and details about hostages or prisoners drafted for release were shuttled back and forth.",
      "\"That takes an enormous amount of work and, I have to say, all of that was not fully nailed down, really, until just the [final] hours,\" said the official.",
      "Inside the building, the delegations met separately with senior figures from Qatar and Egypt. Among those closely involved in the details was Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.",
      "Two crucial areas were worked on in the final phases of the talks: the lists for release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and the positions for Israeli troop withdrawals from populated areas in Gaza during phase one.",
      "By 9 January, the pressure had escalated. Trump's envoy, Biden's envoy, and the Egyptian intelligence chief convened in Doha for a serious eight-hour negotiation session.",
      "A senior Egyptian official told the BBC: \"We are at the closest point to reaching an agreement.\"",
      "Agreement had been reached on 90% of the outstanding issues, but further talks were required.",
      "Steve Witkoff, Trump's recently appointed Middle East envoy, was dispatched to Tel Aviv to meet Netanyahu. Though not yet officially in post, the New York property tycoon had become more and more involved in the talks, which Trump was taking a keen interest in.",
      "He was about to be sent on an assignment that proved to be pivotal.",
      "End game",
      "When Trump's man in the Middle East arrived in Israel on 11 January, it was the sabbath.",
      "Witkoff was asked to wait until the sabbath had ended before he met Netanyahu but, in a breach of custom, the envoy refused and demanded to meet the prime minister immediately.",
      "Netanyahu appears to have come under serious strong-arming during the meeting and the intervention from the Trump camp to get the Israeli government to set aside its final reservations seems to have been critical.",
      "The meeting was reportedly fractious and the message to Netanyahu from the incoming president was clear: Trump wants a deal - now get it done.",
      "Commenting on those talks, an Israeli official who asked to remain anonymous said it was a \"very important meeting\".",
      "When Witkoff returned to Doha, he remained in the room with the talks, spending time with Biden's envoy Mr McGurk, in what two US officials called a \"near unprecedented\" transition effort in American diplomacy.",
      "This week, Hamas official Bassem Naim told Al Arabiya he \"couldn't imagine that [the deal] could be possible without the pressure of the incoming administration led by President Trump\" - and specifically cited Witkoff's presence at the talks.",
      "By now, the fact a deal could be imminent was out in the open and public expectation was building - not least among the families of those being held hostage and Palestinians displaced inside Gaza.",
      "The final 72 hours of talks involved a constant back and forth over the finer points of how the deal would be implemented, according to one account.",
      "One source close to the negotiations described the hammering out of \"arrangements and logistics\" for how the hostages would be released in Gaza and for the withdrawal movements of Israeli troops.",
      "On 12 January, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations said \"all the officials are here in the same building\", adding: \"Tonight is decisive. We are only a few steps away from an agreement.\"",
      "That meeting lasted six hours - but, like so many times before, an impasse was reached.",
      "This time the disagreement that arose was over the mechanism for the return of displaced individuals from southern Gaza to the north.",
      "Israel wanted to search returnees and their vehicles to ensure no militants or military equipment were being transported - which Hamas refused to accept.",
      "Mediators proposed that Qatari and Egyptian technical teams conduct the searches instead. Both sides agreed and one of the final remaining stalemates was resolved.",
      "On 15 January shortly after 18:00, a Hamas negotiator wrote in a message to the BBC: \"Everything is finished.\"",

      "In an interview with Fox News this week, Homan promised a \"big raid\" across the country. He has previously said Chicago will be \"ground zero\" for the mass deportations.",
      "The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency deports illegal migrants all the time. However, the operation it is expected to launch after Trump's inauguration on Monday is expected to target so-called \"sanctuary\" cities that limit co-operation with federal immigration officials.",
      "Along with Chicago, New York City and Los Angeles are among the scores of US cities that have adopted \"sanctuary\" policies.",
      "\"January 21st, you're going to look for a lot of ICE agents in your city looking for criminals and gang members,\" Homan told a Republican gathering in Chicago last month. \"Count on it. It will happen.\"",
      "New York, Los Angeles, Denver and Miami are also due to be targeted with raids, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing unnamed sources familiar with the plans.",
      "Under Democratic President Joe Biden, ICE generally prioritised the arrest of illegal migrants who were serious criminals, had crossed the border recently or posed a national security threat.",
      "While Trump's team has signalled that it will begin with migrants who had committed crimes, all illegal migrants - including those who have lived and worked in the US for many years and have no criminal history - are more likely to be arrested and deported.",
      "Immigration raids at construction sites where undocumented migrants are often employed are also expected to resume, after being discontinued by the Biden administration, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.",
      "Ahead of the expected hardening of US policy, more migrant farm workers have been  seeking advice on dealing with immigration officials and assigning temporary guardians for their children.",
      "\"The administration is not yet sworn in, but people are already afraid,\" Sarait Martinez, executive director of the Centro Binacional para el Desarrollo Ind\u00edgena Oaxaque\u00f1o, which supports Mexican farm workers in California, told Reuters news agency.",
      "As well as pledging to deport millions of illegal migrants and threatening workplace raids, some reports suggest that Trump could also do away with a longstanding policy that has made churches off-limits for ICE arrests.",
      "However, the upcoming raids are likely to pose significant difficulties for officials - with limited custody space to hold those detained.",
      "At the same time, the Laken Riley Act - named after a college student who was murdered last year in Georgia by a Venezuelan man previously arrested for shoplifting - is expected to be passed by US lawmakers next week.",
      "The proposed legislation will require the federal government to detain migrants living in the US illegally who are suspected of criminal activity - even if they are not charged with any crime.",

      "Residents in the city first heard two loud explosions and only then the wail of the air raid siren, around 06:00 local time (04:00 GMT). The missiles had already hit by the time the ballistic threat warning was issued, urging residents to head for shelter.",
      "The attack struck the central Shevchenkivskyi district, where there is now a deep crater in the road outside a business centre.",

      "Beside the main crater, a Ukrainian forensics expert examined fragments of missile collected into a heap of twisted grey metal on the pavement.",
      "Andriy Kulchytskyy, the head of the Military Research Laboratory of the Kyiv Institute of Scientific Expertise, told the BBC the crater was from a direct hit with an Iskander-M ballistic missile, based on markings on the missile fragments.",
      "\"This specific site shows one impact,\" he explained. \"There are additional strikes, and we have collected debris. Here, the missile directly hit the road.\"",
      "Mr Kulchytskyy said the projectile landed before the warning sirens sounded because ballistic missiles travel so quickly that the sirens cannot react in time.",

      "\"I woke up immediately - I even felt the wall shaking. When the third strike came, it was pretty scary.\"",
      "On Saturday morning, the main road has been cordoned off - but a few hours after the strike the neighbouring streets nearby are already busy with traffic. Old ladies are selling chickens and gherkins outside the market, and there are joggers and people walking their dogs.",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 02:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Cholas were a powerful south Indian dynasty known for military conquests, grand temples and shaping global trade and culture.",
    "story": [
      "It's 1000 CE - the heart of the Middle Ages.",
      "Europe is in flux. The powerful nations we know today - like Norman-ruled England and the fragmented territories that will go on to become France - do not yet exist. Towering Gothic cathedrals have yet to rise. Aside from the distant and prosperous city of Constantinople, few great urban centres dominate the landscape.",
      "Yet that year, on the other side of the globe, an emperor from southern India was preparing to build the world's most colossal temple.",
      "Completed just 10 years later, it was 216ft (66m) tall, assembled from 130,000 tonnes of granite: second only to Egypt's pyramids in height. At its heart was a 12ft tall emblem of the Hindu god Shiva, sheathed in gold encrusted with rubies and pearls.",
      "In its lamplit hall were 60 bronze sculptures, adorned with thousands of pearls gathered from the conquered island of Lanka. In its treasuries were several tonnes of gold and silver coins, as well as necklaces, jewels, trumpets and drums torn from defeated kings across India's southern peninsula, making the emperor the richest man of the era.",
      "He was called Raja-Raja, King of Kings, and he belonged to one of the most astonishing dynasties of the medieval world: the Cholas.",
      "His family transformed how the medieval world worked - yet they are largely unknown outside India.",
      "Prior to the 11th Century, the Cholas had been one of the many squabbling powers that dotted the Kaveri floodplain, the great body of silt that flows through India's present-day state of Tamil Nadu.",
      "But what set the Cholas apart was their endless capacity for innovation. By the standards of the medieval world, Chola queens were also remarkably prominent, serving as the dynasty's public face.",
      "Travelling to Tamil villages and rebuilding small, old mud-brick shrines in gleaming stone, the Chola dowager Sembiyan Mahadevi \u2013 Rajaraja's great-aunt \u2013 effectively \"rebranded\" the family as the foremost devotees of Shiva, winning them a popular following.",
      "Sembiyan prayed to Nataraja, a hitherto little-known form of Hindu god Shiva as the King of Dance, and all her temples featured him prominently.",
      "The trend caught on. Today, Nataraja is one of the most recognisable symbols of Hinduism. But to the medieval Indian mind, Nataraja was really a symbol of the Cholas.",
      "The emperor, Rajaraja Chola, shared his great-aunt's taste for public relations and devotion - with one significant difference.",
      "Rajaraja was also a conqueror. In the 990s, he led his armies over the Western Ghats, the range of hills that shelter India's west coast, and burned the ships of his enemies while they were at port.",
      "Next, exploiting internal turmoil on the island of Lanka, he established a Chola outpost there, becoming the first mainland Indian king to set up a lasting presence on the island. At last, he broke into the rugged Deccan Plateau - the Germany to the Tamil coast's Italy - and seized a portion of it for himself.",
      "The loot of conquest was lavished on his great imperial temple, known today as the Brihadishvara.",
      "In addition to its precious treasures, the great temple received 5,000 tonnes of rice annually, from conquered territory across southern India (you'd need a fleet of twelve Airbus A380s to carry that much rice today).",
      "This allowed the Brihadishvara to function as a mega-ministry of public works and welfare, an instrument of the Chola state, intended to channel Rajaraja's vast fortunes into new irrigation systems, expanding cultivation, and vast new herds of sheep and buffalo. Few states in the world could have conceived of economic control at such scale and depth.",
      "The Cholas were as important to the Indian Ocean as the Mongols were to inner Eurasia.",
      "Rajaraja Chola's successor, Rajendra, built alliances with Tamil merchant corporations: a partnership between traders and government power that foreshadowed the East India Company - a powerful British trading corporation that later ruled large parts of India - that was to come more than 700 years later.",
      "In 1026, Rajendra put his troops on merchants' ships and sacked Kedah, a Malay city that dominated the global trade in precious woods and spices.",
      "While some Indian nationalists have proclaimed this to be a Chola \"conquest\" or \"colonisation\" in Southeast Asia, archaeology suggests a stranger picture: the Cholas didn't seem to have a navy of their own, but under them, a wave of Tamil diaspora merchants spread across the Bay of Bengal.",
      "By the late 11th Century, these merchants ran independent ports in northern Sumatra. A century later, they were deep in present-day Myanmar and Thailand, and worked as tax collectors in Java.",
      "In the 13th Century, in Mongol-ruled China under the descendants of Kublai Khan, Tamil merchants ran successful businesses in the port of Quanzhou, and even erected a temple to Shiva on the coast of the East China Sea. It was no coincidence that, under the British Raj in the 19th Century, Tamils made up the largest chunk of Indian administrators and workers in Southeast Asia.",
      "Conquests and global connections made Chola-ruled south India a cultural and economic behemoth, the nexus of planetary trade networks.",
      "Chola aristocrats invested war-loot into a wave of new temples, which sourced fine goods from a truly global economy linking the farthest shores of Europe and Asia. Copper and tin for their bronzes came from Egypt, perhaps even Spain. Camphor and sandalwood for the gods were sourced from Sumatra and Borneo.",
      "Tamil temples grew into vast complexes and public spaces, surrounded by markets and endowed with rice estates. In the Chola capital region on the Kaveri, corresponding to the present-day city of Kumbakonam, a constellation of a dozen temple-towns supported populations of tens of thousands, possibly outclassing most cities in Europe at the time.",
      "These Chola cities were astonishingly multicultural and multireligious: Chinese Buddhists rubbed shoulders with Tunisian Jews, Bengali tantric masters traded with Lankan Muslims.",
      "Today, the state of Tamil Nadu is one of India's most urbanised.  Many of the state's towns grew around Chola-period shrines and markets.",
      "These developments in urbanism and architecture were paralleled in art and literature.",
      "Medieval Tamil metalwork, produced for Chola-period temples, is perhaps the finest ever made by human hand, the artists rivalling Michelangelo or Donatello for their appreciation of the human figure. To praise Chola kings and adore the gods, Tamil poets developed notions of sainthood, history and even magical realism. The Chola period was what you'd get if the Renaissance had happened in south India 300 years before its time.",
      "It is not a coincidence that Chola bronzes - especially Nataraja bronzes - can be found in most major Western museum collections. Scattered across the world, they are the remnants of a period of brilliant political innovations, of maritime expeditions that connected the globe; of titanic shrines and fabulous wealth; of merchants, rulers and artists who shaped the planet we live in today.",

    "story": [
      "After lying hidden beneath metres of volcanic rock and ash for 2,000 years, a \"once-in-a-century\" find has been unearthed in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in Italy.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered a sumptuous private bathhouse - potentially the largest ever found there - complete with hot, warm and cold rooms, exquisite artwork, and a huge plunge pool.",
      "The spa-like complex sits at the heart of a grand residence uncovered over the last two years during a major excavation.",
      "\"It's these spaces that really are part of the 'Pompeii effect' - it's almost as if the people had only left a minute ago,\" says Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, who has revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "Analysis of two skeletons discovered in the house also shows the horror faced by Pompeii's inhabitants when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79.",
      "The bodies belonged to a woman, aged between 35 and 50, who was clutching jewellery and coins, and a younger man in his teens or early 20s.",
      "They had barricaded themselves into a small room, but were killed as a tsunami of superheated volcanic gas and ash - known as a pyroclastic flow - ripped through the town.",
      "\"This is a dramatic place, and everything you find here tells you about the drama,\" says Pompeii conservator, Dr Ludovica Alesse.",
      "A third of the ancient city still lies hidden beneath volcanic debris from the disaster, but the new excavation - the most extensive in a generation - provides new insights into ancient Roman life.",
      "The archaeologists have been followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig.",
      "An entire block of Pompeii has now been uncovered, revealing a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house. It's thought these were all owned by one wealthy individual, possibly Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.",
      "The discovery of the bathhouse is further confirmation of his elite status, says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"",
      "Those lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.",
      "They would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.",
      "Next they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.",
      "Finally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.",
      "\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "The bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.",
      "A huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.",
      "The residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.",
      "Next door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.",
      "The skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.",
      "\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",
      "Analysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.",
      "The woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.",
      "\"She was probably someone higher up in society,\" says Dr Hay. \"She could have been the wife of the owner of the house - or maybe an assistant looking after the wife, we just don't know.\"",
      "An assortment of items were found on a marble table top in the room - glassware, bronze jugs and pottery - perhaps brought into the room where the pair had tucked themselves away hoping to wait out the eruption.",
      "But it's the items clutched by the victims that are of particular interest. The younger man held some keys, while the older woman was found with gold and silver coins and jewellery.",
      "These are kept in Pompeii's vault, along with the city's other priceless finds, and we were given a chance to see them with archaeologist, Dr Alessandro Russo.",
      "The gold coins still gleam as if they were new, and he shows us delicate gold and natural pearl earrings, necklace pendants and intricately etched semi-precious stones.",
      "\"When we find this kind of object, the distance from ancient times and modern times disappears,\" Dr Russo says, \"and we can touch a small piece of the life of these people who died in the eruption.\"",
      "Dr Sophie Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also sheds more light on a darker side of Roman life.",
      "Just behind the hot room is a boiler room. A pipe brought water in from the street - with some syphoned off into the cold plunge pool - and the rest was heated in a lead boiler destined for the hot room. The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.",
      "With a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.",
      "\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.",
      "\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.",
      "\"A wall is all that could divide you between two different worlds.\"",
      "The excavation is in its final weeks - but new discoveries continue to emerge from the ash. Limited numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the dig while it's ongoing, but eventually it will be fully opened to the public.",
      "\"Every day here is a surprise,\" says Dr Anna Onesti, director of the excavation.",
      "\"Sometimes in the morning I come to work thinking that it's a normal working day - and then I discover we found something exceptional.",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 01:05:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Gas from the seafloor has scientists wondering if oxygen could be found in the oceans of other planets.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists who recently discovered that metal lumps on the dark seabed make oxygen, have announced plans to study the deepest parts of Earth's oceans in order to understand the strange phenomenon.",
      "Their mission could \"change the way we look at the possibility of life on other planets too,\" the researchers say.",
      "The initial discovery confounded marine scientists. It was previously accepted that oxygen could only be produced in sunlight by plants - in a process called photosynthesis.",
      "If oxygen - a vital component of life - is made in the dark by metal lumps, the researchers believe that process could be happening on other planets, creating oxygen-rich environments where life could thrive.",
      "Lead researcher Prof Andrew Sweetman explained: \"We are already in conversation with experts at Nasa who believe dark oxygen could reshape our understanding of how life might be sustained on other planets without direct sunlight.",
      "\"We want to go out there and figure out what exactly is going on.\"",
      "A dark, controversial discovery",
      "The initial discovery triggered a global scientific row - there was criticism of the findings from some scientists and from deep sea mining companies that plan to harvest the precious metals in the seabed nodules.",
      "If oxygen is produced at these extreme depths, in total darkness, that calls into question what life could survive and thrive on the seafloor, and what impact mining activities could have on that marine life.",
      "That means that seabed mining companies and environmental organisations - some of which claimed that the findings provided evidence that seafloor mining plans should be halted - will be watching this new investigation closely.",
      "The plan is to work at sites where the seabed is more than 10km (6.2 miles) deep, using remotely-operated submersible equipment.",
      "\"We have instruments that can go to the deepest parts of the ocean,\" explained Prof Sweetman. \"We're pretty confident we'll find it happening elsewhere, so we'll start probing what's causing it.\"",
      "Some of those experiments, in collaboration with scientists at Nasa, will aim to understand whether the same process could allow microscopic life to thrive beneath oceans that are on other planets and moons.",
      "\"If there's oxygen,\" said Prof Sweetman, \"there could be microbial life taking advantage of that.\"",
      "To mine or not to mine",
      "The initial, biologically baffling findings were published last year in the journal Nature Geoscience. They came from several expeditions to an area of the deep sea between Hawaii and Mexico, where Prof Sweetman and his colleagues sent sensors to the seabed - at about 5km (3.1 miles) depth.",
      "That area is part of a vast swathe of seafloor that is covered with the naturally occurring metal nodules, which form when dissolved metals in seawater collect on fragments of shell - or other debris. It's a process that takes millions of years.",
      "Sensors that the team deployed repeatedly showed oxygen levels going up.",
      "\"I just ignored it, Prof Sweetman told BBC News at the time, \"because I'd been taught that you only get oxygen through photosynthesis\".",
      "Eventually, he and his colleagues stopped ignoring their readings and set out instead to understand what was going on. Experiments in their lab - with nodules that the team collected submerged in beakers of seawater - led the scientists to conclude that the metallic lumps were making oxygen out of seawater. The nodules, they found, generated electric currents that could split (or electrolyse) molecules of seawater into hydrogen and oxygen.",
      "Then came the backlash, in the form of rebuttals - posted online - from scientists and from seabed mining companies.",
      "One of the critics, Michael Clarke from the Metals Company, a Canadian deep sea mining company, told BBC News that the criticism was focused on a \"lack of scientific rigour in the experimental design and data collection\". Basically, he and other critics claimed there was no oxygen production - just bubbles that the equipment produced during sample collection.",
      "\"We've ruled out that possibility,\" Prof Sweetman responded. \"But these [new] experiments will provide the proof.\"",
      "This might seem a niche, technical argument, but several multi-billion pound mining companies are already exploring the possibility of harvesting tonnes of these metals from the seafloor.",
      "The natural deposits they are targeting contain metals vital for making batteries, and demand for those metals is increasing rapidly as many economies move from fossil fuels to, for example, electric vehicles.",
      "The race to extract those resources has caused concern among environmental groups and researchers. More than 900 marine scientists from 44 countries have signed a petition\u00a0highlighting the environmental risks and calling for a pause on mining activity.",
      "Talking about his team's latest research mission at a press conference on Friday, Prof Sweetman said: \"Before we do anything, we need to - as best as possible - understand the [deep sea] ecosystem.",
      "\"I think the right decision is to hold off before we decide if this is the right thing to do as a a global society.\""

      "Shortly after the top court's ruling, President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social saying he would review the situation, but everyone must respect the Supreme Court decision.",
      "\"My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!,\" he said.",

      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform,\" the brief read.",
      "They didn't get their wish, but several of Trump's aides have since floated the possibility of a presidential executive order on Monday afternoon delaying implementation of the ban. Trump also spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the topic of TikTok came up.",

      "If the incoming president can ultimately find a way to satisfy national security concerns while keeping TikTok up and running in the US, it would provide him with an opportunity to post an early political win in his second term and be celebrated by TikTok's loyal users.",
      "There is a certain amount of irony to this, as it was conservatives \u2013 including Trump - who first championed a ban.",
      "The Biden administration, for its part, seemed happy to drop the TikTok situation into the incoming president's lap.",
      "It was quick to issue a statement responding to the court's decision, emphasising that the goal of the law is not to ban TikTok, but to force its sale to American ownership. As had been predicted, however, the outgoing Democratic president punted enforcement of the ban to Donald Trump, who will become president at noon on Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court, in its unsigned opinion with no dissents, avoided weighing in on these kind of political calculations. The justices sided with a lower court that upheld the constitutionality of the law that could ban the popular social media service if it is not sold by midnight on Sunday.",
      "While the court's opinion is narrow \u2013 the justices acknowledge the time pressure they were under to issue this decision \u2013 it firmly establishes that the constitutional protections of free speech contained in the First Amendment to the US Constitution do not save TikTok.",
      "In fact, the justices found that the TikTok ban, which Congress justified on the basis of protecting national security by preventing an adversary from collecting troves of data on tens of millions of American users, had a lower bar to clear than laws that directly regulate speech content.",
      "The court sidestepped other tricky issues \u2013 such as whether concerns about Chinese influence on TikTok's algorithm justified a ban. But expect that to come up in future policy debates in Congress.",
      "With the court's decision, TikTok has exhausted its last legal recourse to avoid the ban from going into effect. For Trump, however, the TikTok ban is his first presidential challenge \u2013 but also his first political opportunity."

    "story": [
      "This story contains details, including a video, that some people may find distressing.",
      "As Mzwandile Mkwayi was lowered into the South African mine in a red metal cage attached to a hoist above ground, the first thing that struck him was the smell.",
      "\"Let me tell you something,\" he tells the BBC, \"those bodies really smelled bad\".",
      "When he got home later that day, he told his wife he could not eat the meat she had cooked.",
      "\"It's because when I spoke to the miners, they told me some of them had to eat other [people] inside the mine because there was no way they could find food. And they were also eating cockroaches,\" he said on a phone call from his home.",
      "Allegations that the miners resorted to eating human flesh in order to survive were also made by other miners who were rescued in December, in statements submitted to the high court.",
      "Mkwayi, a former convict, known locally as Shasha, lives in the township of Khuma that was close to the disused mine in Stilfontein. The 36-year-old, who had served seven years in prison for robbery, volunteered to go down to help with the rescue effort.",
      "\"I'm being rehabilitated by the correctional services and I volunteered because people in our community were seeking help for their children and brothers.",
      "\"The rescue company said they didn't have anyone who wanted to go down. So my friend Mandla and I agreed to volunteer so we could help our brothers to resurface and bring up the dead bodies.\"",
      "But even though he wanted to help, the 25-minute journey down the 2km (1.2 mile)-deep shaft filled him with terror.",
      "The crane would occasionally stop and start, leaving him dangling in the darkness. Once he got down into the mine, he was shocked by what he saw.",
      "\"There were lots of bodies, over 70 bodies, and around 200 or so people that were dehydrated.",
      "\"I felt very weak when I saw them, it was a painful thing to see. But Mandla and I decided we needed to be strong and not show them how we felt so we could motivate them.\"",
      "The miners who had been waiting for help for months, gave them a hero's welcome.",
      "\"They were very, very happy,\" he says.",
      "The miners had been stuck there following a nationwide police operation to end illicit mining at disused sites that had closed, as the industry \u2013 once the backbone of the country's economy \u2013 was shrinking.",
      "It was no longer profitable for mining multinationals to operate in many places, but the promise of still finding gold deposits was a magnet for many desperate people \u2013 particularly undocumented migrants.",
      "Thousands of shafts were abandoned.",
      "In November, police stepped up efforts at the Buffelsfontein mine in Stilfontein, surrounding the entrance to the shaft and refusing to let food and water go down.",
      "Before the rescue operation began on Monday, the local community had tried to take matters into their own hands by lowering a rope down the shaft to try and pull out some of the men.",
      "They also sent down messages and told the miners that help was coming.",
      "\"So when we got there, they were already waiting for the crane. Now when they see us, they see us as their presidents, as their messiahs: the people that came from outside into the hole to help them to resurface.\"",
      "The police say the illegal miners were always able to come out on their own but were refusing to do so because they feared arrest. But Mkwayi disagrees: \"It's a lie that people didn't want to come out. Those people were desperate for help, they were dying.\"",
      "While at the mine site on Tuesday, the BBC saw dozens of the rescued men.",
      "They appeared emaciated, their bones visible through their clothes. Some could barely walk and had to be helped by medical staff.",
      "In statements submitted to the high court, the illegal miners describe in graphic details the slow and painful death of their peers. They say many died of starvation.",
      "\"From September through October 2024, the absence of even basic sustenance was absolute, and survival became a daily battle against starvation,\" one miner was recorded as saying.",
      "Mkwayi says the men he rescued were so frail that the rescue cage that is only meant to carry seven healthy adults could take 13 of them.",
      "\"They were very dehydrated and had lost weight so we managed to fit more into the cage, because they wouldn't have survived another two days down in the hole. They would be dead if we didn't get them out as soon as possible.\"",
      "The volunteers were also in charge of bringing up dead bodies.",
      "\"The rescue services gave us bags and told us to put the bodies in them and bring them up in the cage which we did with the help of some of the miners.\"",
      "The rescue operation was initially meant to last at least a week, but after just three days, the volunteers said no-one was left underground.",
      "The authorities sent a camera down the shaft to do a final sweep. They say the mine will now be permanently sealed.",
      "But the experience has deeply impacted Mkwayi.",
      "At one point during the call he asks for a question to be repeated, explaining that his hearing has been affected since going down into the mine, presumably by the pressure.",
      "But the hardest impact has been from what he witnessed.",
      "\"I have to tell you, I am traumatised. I will never forget the sight of these people for the rest of my life.\"",
      "For activists and trade unions helping the community, the death of the 87 people in the mine amounts to a \"massacre\" perpetrated by the authorities.",
      "The use of the emotive word has drawn comparisons with the shooting dead by police of 34 striking miners in Marikana, some 150km (93 miles) away from Stilfontein, in 2012.",
      "But this time no triggers were pulled. Instead it seems many of the men starved to death.",
      "The authorities reject the idea they were responsible.",
      "The government initiated the crackdown on illicit mining in December 2023 through Operation Vala Umgodi (meaning \"close the hole\" in isiZulu).",
      "The abandoned mines had been taken over by gangs, often led by former employees, which sold what was found on the black market.",
      "People were co-opted into this illicit trade, either by force or voluntarily, and made to spend months underground digging for minerals. The government says illegal mining cost South Africa's economy $3.2bn (\u00a32.6bn) in 2024 alone.",
      "As part of the police operation, entry points at various disused mines were blocked, along with food and water supplies, in a bid to flush out the illegal miners, known locally as zama zamas (which translates as \"take a chance\").",
      "While Vala Umgodi was largely successful in other provinces, the old Buffelsfontein gold mine presented a unique challenge.",
      "Prior to the police operation, most of the miners were only able to get underground through a makeshift pulley system operated by people at the surface.",
      "But they then abandoned the top of the mineshaft when security officials arrived in large numbers in August, leaving those in the mine stranded.",
      "Community members then stepped in to help, pulling a few people up using ropes, but this was a long, arduous process.",
      "Other difficult and dangerous exits were available and in all nearly 2,000 resurfaced - most were arrested and remain in police custody.",
      "Why others did not come out is not clear \u2013 they may have been too weak or were being threatened by gang members in the mine - but they were left in desperate circumstances.",
      "Out of the 87 who died, only two have been identified, police said on Thursday, explaining that the fact that many were undocumented migrants made the process harder.",
      "\"We hold the view that government has blood on its hands,\" Magnificent Mndebele from the Mining Affected Communities United in Action group (Macua), told the BBC.",
      "He argued that the miners were given no warning about what was about to happen before the police operation began.",
      "Over the past two months, Macua has been at the forefront of the various court battles initiated to compel the government to first allow supplies and then undertake a rescue operation.",
      "Its blaming of the government echoes earlier statements from families who had said that the authorities had killed their loved ones.",
      "They had taken a hard line since the operation intensified. In November, one minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, made the now infamous statement during a press briefing that they were going to \"smoke them out\".",
      "The state refused to allow food to be sent down or anyone to help retrieve the miners, only caving in after several successful court applications.",
      "In November, small portions of instant maize and water made it down the shaft, but in a court statement, one of the miners said it was not enough for the hundreds of men down below, many of whom were too weak to even chew and swallow them.",
      "More food was delivered in December, but again it could not sustain the men.",
      "Given that the operation to bring up the men and bodies lasted just three days, what is hard for Mr Mndebele to understand is why this could not have been done sooner, when it was clear there was an issue.",
      "\"We're disappointed by our government, frankly put, because this help has come too late.\"",
      "While the government is yet to formally respond to these accusations, police have vowed to continue with the wider operations to clear the country's disused mines until May this year.",
      "Speaking to journalists in Stilfontein on Tuesday, Mining Minister Gwede Mantashe was unapologetic. He said the government would intensify the fight against illegal mining, which he labelled a crime and an \"attack on the economy\".",
      "On Thursday, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu was a little more conciliatory.",
      "\"I do understand and accept that this is an emotional issue. Everyone wants to judge\u2026 but it would help all of us as South Africans to wait until pathologists have done and completed their job,\" he said.",
      "The police have defended their actions, saying providing the miners with food would have \"allowed criminality to thrive\".",
      "Illegal miners have been accused of fostering criminality in the communities where they operate.",
      "A number of stories have been published in local media linking the zama zamas to various rapes and murders.",
      "But for Mkwayi, who put his own safety on the line to help the miners, the men in the Stilfontein mine were just trying to make a living.",
      "\"People went down 2km with a rope and risked their lives to put food on the table for their families.\"",
      "He said he wants the government to give licences to artisanal miners who are forced to go into disused mines due to South Africa's high unemployment rate.",
      "\"If your children are hungry, you won't think twice about going down there because you have to feed them. You'll risk your life to put food on the table.\"",

      "This latest mission involves 120 trucks - the biggest since the war began in October 2023. The Jordanian aid operation is a sign to Gazans that - by their neighbours at least - they are not forgotten. Jordan's leader, King Abdullah II, has personally pushed the Kingdom's efforts to get food, medicine and fuel into Gaza.",
      "The international community has promised an aid surge once the ceasefire is established.  \"It is imperative that this ceasefire removes the significant security and political obstacles to delivering aid across Gaza,\" said the UN Secretary General, Antonio Gutteres. \"The humanitarian situation is at catastrophic levels.\" Ninety percent of Gaza's 2.2 million people are displaced. Up to two million depend on aid.",
      "This comes after 15 months of conflict in which the UN and aid agencies have accused Israel of repeatedly blocking or delaying distribution of vital food, medicine and fuel. Israel denies it impedes aid. But at one point the United States threatened to cut military aid to Israel because of the low level of aid reaching Gaza.",

A slight, smiling child, she was waiting at a centre run by World Food Kitchens, seven of whose aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike last April. Farah's family is separated from their father who is in the north of the Gaza strip. She told our reporter she dreamed constantly about a ceasefire.",

      "Inflation, which measures not price levels but the rate of price increases, has already come down significantly, while proving tough to stamp out completely.",

      "Trump pinned his claim to promises to expand already-record US oil and gas production, reducing energy costs. But the forces that affect inflation, and energy prices, are mostly outside presidential control.",
      "To the extent that White House policies make a difference, analysts have warned that many of Trump's ideas - including tax cuts, tariffs and migrant deportations - risk making the problem worse.",
      "Economist John Cochrane of the right-leaning Hoover Institution said the big question facing the economy is how Trump will juggle \"tension\" between the more traditional pro-business parts of his coalition and the \"nationalists\" who are focused on issues such as border control and rivalry with China.",

      "Seven years after their baby daughter was killed during a brutal midnight operation by police in Kenya at a time of post-election tension, Joseph Oloo Abanja and Lensa Achieng are still raw with emotion as the case against the alleged officers involved has once again been delayed.",
      "\"It is a scar that will never fade away,\" Ms Achieng, a hotel worker, tells the BBC about the death of six-month-old Samantha Pendo who died with a broken skull and of internal bleeding.",
      "After each postponement or small development, the couple are swamped with calls. Each moment of expectation leads to disappointment in their search for justice.",
      "The family live in the western city of Kisumu - an opposition stronghold where riots broke out in August 2017 amid anger about the results of an election that was eventually re-run because of irregularities.",
      "Their small home was along a road in the Nyalenda informal settlement that witnessed protests on 11 August where anti-riot police were deployed.",
      "That night the couple locked their wooden door and barricaded it with furniture. At around midnight, they heard their neighbours' doors being broken down and some of the occupants being beaten.",
      "It was not long before police officers arrived at their door.",
      "\"They knocked and kicked it several times [but] I refused to open,\" Mr Abanja tells the BBC, adding that he pleaded with them to spare his family of four.",
      "But the battering continued until the officers found a small space through which they threw a tear-gas canister into the one-roomed house, forcing the family out.",
      "Mr Abanja says he was ordered to lie down outside the door and then the beating started.",
      "\"They were going for my head so I held my hands up, and they beat my hands until they could not hold any more.\"",
      "His wife came out of the house holding Samantha, who was having difficulty breathing because of the tear gas, and was not spared either.",
      "\"They went ahead beating me [with clubs] while I was holding my daughter,\" Ms Achieng says.",
      "The next thing she felt was her daughter holding her tight \"as if she was in pain\".",
      "\"I turned her and what was coming outside her mouth? It was foam.\"",
      "She shouted that they had killed her daughter and it was at that moment the beatings stopped and Mr Abanja was ordered to administer first aid.",
      "The baby came to but was badly injured.",
      "The couple say officers then swiftly left and neighbours helped them rush Samantha to hospital. She died after three days in intensive care.",
      "Their quest for justice has been long and frustrating, like that of dozens of others caught up in the post-poll violence.",
      "Twelve police officers have been expected to be charged with murder, rape and torture - but the hearing at which this will happen, when they will be asked to enter a plea, has yet to happen.",
      "One of the victims' lawyers, Willys Otieno, reckons that the delay is due to a lack of political will to deliver justice to victims of election violence.",
      "Uhuru Kenyatta went on to win the election re-run later in 2017 - the opposition candidate withdrew from the contest. His deputy William Ruto, with whom he later fell out, was victorious in the next vote - taking office in September 2022.",
      "\"The state is no longer interested in prosecuting the perpetrators, [and] it is now left to victims' counsels - those of us who work with non-governmental organisations and human rights groups to put pressure for the charges to be registered and the accused persons to go to trial,\" Mr Otieno tells the BBC.",
      "He accuses the current director of public prosecutions (DPP) of \"acting like an attorney of the accused\".",
      "\"It is not even the accused persons who've applied to court for adjournment - it is the DPP who has applied to court to adjourn the plea taking,\" the lawyer said about two failed attempts at taking a plea last October and November.",
      "The third attempt was meant to happen two days ago but was postponed due to the transfer of the presiding judge  - and has been rescheduled for the end of the month.",
      "The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) told the BBC it could not handle a request for comment, but posted on X that \"the case remains one of the most high-profile in recent history, with Baby Pendo's death symbolising the tragic outcomes of police brutality during the 2017 post-election unrest\".",
      "But those involved in the case find the delays troubling.",
      "\"It was the Office of the DPP that initiated this case, and they were the ones that reached out to us several years ago. They asked us to join a victim support group that was essentially established to make sure that they would have witnesses for their case,\" Irungu Houghton, head of the rights group Amnesty International Kenya, tells the BBC.",
      "After initial investigations, the DPP at the time, Nurdin' Hajji, initiated a public inquest into the death of baby Samantha. The judge found the police culpable.",
      "Subsequently, the public prosecutor ordered further investigations into other cases resulting from the police operation of August 2017, and brought in independent constitutional investigative bodies, civil society and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.",
      "The probe uncovered evidence which the DPP said pointed to \"the systematic use of violence, including killing, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, against civilians, all of which constitute serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity\".",
      "In October 2022, the prosecutor then sought to have the suspects charged, for the first time in Kenya's history under its International Crimes Act.",
      "Those to be charged include commanders deemed liable because of their responsibility as superior officers - another first for Kenya.",
      "In September 2023 a new DPP took office, Renson M Ingonga, but there has been little movement in the case since.",
      "There appears to be \"an unwillingness to try to prosecute this case,\" says Mr Houghton.",
      "Mr Otieno says the victims' lawyers may consider seeking justice via a private prosecution or going to the East African Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (ICC) if the delays continue.",
      "Kisumu governor and opposition leader Peter Anyango' Nyong'o has now appealed to the chief justice to take up the matter and \"find out immediately whether someone or groups of people are sabotaging this case to protect some people\".",
      "If not, he agrees the ICC could be the way to go: \"We may be forced to write to the ICC to move in should the local courts continue to delay the cases, because justice delayed is justice denied.\"",
      "Samantha's parents support this idea as without justice they say they cannot heal - each postponement reopens their wounds.",
      "\"It doesn't matter how I'll do it, but I'll make sure that I have justice,\" says Mr Abanja,  who is now 40 and makes a living as a tuk-tuk taxi driver.",
      "\"Because they took away something that is so much precious of me - she was everything to me, that little girl I named after my mum.\"",

    "title": "Is TikTok banned in the US? What to know after Supreme Court decision",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 16:41:03 GMT",
    "summary": "Could there be ways to bypass the ban - and could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop the law?",
    "story": [
      "TikTok is set to be banned in the US on 19 January after the Supreme Court denied a last ditch legal bid from its Chinese owner, ByteDance.",
      "It found the law banning the social media platform did not violate the first amendment rights of TikTok and its 170 million users, as the companies argued.",
      "But will the decision of the country's highest judicial authority actually stop Americans using it?",
      "President-elect Donald Trump says, simply, the future of TikTok is up to him.",
      "And the White House says \"given the sheer fact of timing\", the process of implementing the law will indeed fall to Trump, who will be sworn in on Monday - the day after the ban comes into effect.",
      "So what happens next?",
      "Can Trump overturn the ban?",
      "Trump may once have sought to ban TikTok - but he has repeatedly indicated during 2024 that he is now firmly against the law, and tried unsuccessfully to get it delayed.",
      "Despite the court's ruling, in an interview with CNN, he has insisted TikTok's future rests with him - even if he gave no indication of what his decision on the future of the social media platform would be.",
      "On social media he indicated his next steps might take some time to work out.",
      "\"The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it,\" he wrote.",
      "\"My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation.\"",
      "Before that interview he has made it clear however he would be seeking what he previously called a \"political solution.\"",
      "On Friday, just before the court released its ruling, he said he spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok, as well as issues around trade.",
      "\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately,\" he posted on social media.",
      "And on Thursday Trump's incoming national security advised Mike Waltz told Fox News the president-elect was looking for ways to \"preserve\" TikTok, saying Americans' access to the platform and their data would be preserved.",
      "\"I don't want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we're going to create the space to put that deal in place,\" Mr Waltz said.",
      "The Biden administration has made clear they will not enforce the law - so another option would be for Trump to follow suit and allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to ignore it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow people to download TikTok onto their devices, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment.",
      "Can people still use TikTok even if it's banned?",
      "If Trump can't unban TikTok, then what happens?",
      "The most likely way the US would enforce the ban is to order app stores to make it unavailable for download in that region.",
      "But the DoJ has said the actual process of implementing the law - and making sure firms are compliant - will be \"a process that plays out over time\".",
      "If people can no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok through digital storefronts it won't impact those who've already got it on their phones.",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?",
      "Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "But because the app most likely won't be publicly available anymore, new updates will no longer be delivered to users in the US - which will make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable.",
      "Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target.",
      "Of course, there are ways around such a ban.",
      "There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region.",
      "The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements.",
      "It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks.",
      "However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app.",
      "So if the ban ends up taking this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will still be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "However there are other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",
      "TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US.",
      "Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said the complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next.",
      "But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself.",
      "\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\" he said.",
      "Who could buy TikTok?",
      "Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table.",
      "But could that change now that it has actually been banned - and what will happen when a president who prides himself on \"the art of the deal\" returns to the White House?",
      "Potential buyers continue to line up - with Bloomberg News reporting on Tuesday that the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, though TikTok has since described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.",
      "There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December."

    "title": "If TikTok goes, so will livelihoods: \"We'd have to completely rebuild\"",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:09:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say no other app offers the same financial opportunities as TikTok, while creators fear loss of income if it disappears.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

      "And I was ready. Because I'd been collecting. I had enough fireworks to last the whole summer. I took every penny I made from my Newsday delivery route and poured them into \"belts,\" these macho configurations of 144 firecrackers. These particular belts came straight from China, with Chinese calligraphy on the wrapper, and to my young perspective, they were the ultimate asset. Better than gold.",
      "I bought belt after belt from Andy Mahoney, who was notorious in my neighborhood for lighting my neighbor's garage on fire with a chlorine bomb. He was an anti-hero, a rebel with a cause, five years older than I was. The only reason he talked with me was because I was buying from him.",
      "Initially I kept all that gunpowder in the ingenious hideaway I'd devised: the side drawer of my desk. By some miracle, my mother never found them. But they couldn't just sit in that drawer forever; I had to see if they would work.",
      "So I decided to get a pack of matches, lock myself in the family bathroom, and throw lit firecrackers out the only window. My father was down in the den, my mother in the kitchen. How could I possibly get caught? I proceeded to create my own personal preview of the Fourth of July.",

      "\"Nothing,\" I said, my voice extremely calm.",
      "I dropped another lit belt out the window.",

      "I looked around the family bathroom: Where could I hide these suckers? Where could I hide myself? Nowhere seemed promising. So, after a moment, I opened the door.",
      "A plume of smoke billowed out into the rest of the house. I was covered in soot. My father looked me over, and as he stood there for what felt like a very long time, I was sure he was going to hand me my head. And not on a platter.",
      "\"I'll tell you what I'm going to do,\" he said. I started to sweat. \"How many firecrackers do you have?\"",
      "I went to my trusty desk drawer and slid it open. He was the only human to ever see that cache\u2014other than Andy Mahoney.",
      "\"That's a lot of gunpowder. How did you get all these firecrackers?\"",
      "\"They're called belts, Dad,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows\u2014not the right answer. \"I got them using my newspaper route money.\"",

      "I was going to light firecrackers with my father? These were contraband, but he\u2014an ex-cop\u2014was willing to put himself in harm's way for me? That's a dad. That's a father.",
      "We stood on the patio, and as the sun started to set, we handed each other single cylinders of gunpowder. My father had his Zippo lighter\u2014he lit each one carefully and then threw it onto the lawn. Pow! Bang! My dad was lighting firecrackers, and it made me delirious. I carefully twisted a cracker off the belt, handed it to my dad, barrel first, and within seconds it had exploded into a green cloud of smithereens.",
      "Then my father started to get creative\u2014he'd light the firecrackers and then throw them high so they'd explode in mid-air, nipping the edge of the mimosa tree. After a time, he turned to me.",

      "I started slow, lighting the wick and then running as I dropped them on the ground. But I saw my father's confidence and started to throw them onto the lawn too. Dad threw one. I threw one. Our explosions echoing one another: call and response, question and answer.",

    "summary": "Justin Baldoni's lawsuit comes after \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively accused him of sexual harassment.",
    "story": [
      "Justin Baldoni filed a counter lawsuit against \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, on Thursday, alleging the couple hijacked his film and sought to destroy his livelihood and career.",
      "In the lawsuit's 179-page complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, Baldoni accuses Lively and Reynolds of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "The lawsuit, which also named Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, and her firm Vision PR Inc., comes shortly after Baldoni filed a separate defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which first reported Lively's allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni during the film's production.",
      "Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath and two others are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds. They're seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "A spokesperson from Lively's legal team said Baldoni's counterclaim is a typical tactic abusers use to discredit victims by turning the tables on them. The spokesperson said the DARVO claim \u2014 deny, attack, reverse victim offender \u2014 is a well-documented method often discussed during the Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard trials.",
      "\"They are trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony's cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\"",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney representing Baldoni, told CBS News in a statement the lawsuit details alleged evidence that Lively disseminated \"grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.\"",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret,\" Freedman said.",
      "Lively in December came forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni, who also directed and co-financed the film adaption of the 2016\u00a0Colleen Hoover\u00a0novel that explores domestic violence and emotional abuse.",
      "Lively's complaint against Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer Studios, originally reported by The New York Times, included accusations that, after a meeting in which she and Reynolds addressed alleged \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "\"The allegations against The New York Times in this new lawsuit are meritless and recycled from the equally baseless claims in the suit that was filed against The Times in California,\" a spokesperson for The New York Times said in a statement.",
      "According to The New York Times, Lively's lawsuit also included texts allegedly sent by Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, to crisis PR specialist Melissa Nathan, both of whom are named as plaintiffs in Baldoni's lawsuit, which say the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and, \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "In Baldoni's countersuit, he claimed that his former publicist, Stephanie Jones, was \"filled with impotent rage\" at him and Abel, who left Jones' company Jonesworks to form her own firm and work for Baldoni.",
      "In turn, Baldoni's lawsuit alleges, Jones colluded with Lively, Reynolds and Sloane to seize Abel's phone and \"mine it for messages that, stripped of context, could be used to concoct a false narrative\" to make it appear that Baldoni was behind negative press coverage and public reactions to Lively.",
      "The new lawsuit says the plaintiffs did not want to file the suit, but that Lively \"has unequivocally left them with no choice, not only to set the record straight in response to Lively's accusations, but also to put the spotlight on the parts of Hollywood that they have dedicated their careers to being the antithesis of.\"",
      "An email seeking comment from Sloane, whose PR company represents both Lively and Reynolds, was not immediately answered.",
      "The two actors are also represented by the WME agency, which dropped Baldoni as a client after Lively filed a legal complaint that was a precursor to her lawsuit, and the Times published its story on the fight surrounding the film.",
      "The surprise hit film has made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 08:35:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench,\u200b Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith\u200b, Joan Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy.",
    "story": [
      "Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.'s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\"She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\" the family said. \"We are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",
      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" to William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice.\" She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's \"The Chairs,\" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles \"Major Barbara\" and \"Saint Joan.\"",
      "\"I've been very privileged to have such a life,\" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with\u00a0The Actor's Work. \"I mean it's magic and I still feel, when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain, the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me.\"",
      "The esteem in which Plowright was held in London was evident with the news that theaters across the West End will dim their lights for two minutes at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in her honor.",
      "Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England, her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school, she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.",
      "Following her London stage debut in 1954, Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men, such as John Osborne, who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new, rough-hewn, working-class actors like Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.",
      "Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" in 1956, starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.",
      "A year later, she co-starred with her future husband Olivier in the original London production of Osborne's \"The Entertainer.\" She played Olivier's daughter in the work and the two reunited for the 1960 film adaptation.",
      "By then, Plowright's marriage to British actor Roger Cage had ended, as had Olivier's 20-year union with Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961, while both were starring on Broadway, he in \"Becket\" and she in \"A Taste of Honey,\" for which she won a Tony.",
      "One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: \"I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you, or write to you \u2014 a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence, passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody.\"",
      "Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that, Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60, satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.",
      "She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of \"Surviving Picasso,\" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of \"101 Dalmatians\" in 1996 with Glenn Close.",
      "She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip \"Dennis the Menace,\" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire \"Last Action Hero\" in 1993.",
      "Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year, in 1993, when she won the supporting actress TV award for \"Stalin\" and the supporting actress movie award for \"Enchanted April.\" For the latter, which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy, she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.",
      "Not all her works were career roses, as with the disastrous \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy \"Goose on the Loose\" didn't rouse critics.",
      "A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame \u2014 bestowing awards, defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.",
      "\"That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him,\" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. \"When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes, then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight.\"",
      "Plowright is survived by her three children \u2014 Tamsin, Richard and Julie-Kate, all actors, and several grandchildren.",

      "\"It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch,\" a statement posted to Lynch's social media reads. \"We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.' It's a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.\"",
      "Lynch, who would have turned 79 on Monday, revealed in August 2024 that he was diagnosed with emphysema, a chronic lung disease, after years of smoking.",
      "Lynch, who was born in Montana in 1946, was a writer, director and painter who studied at the American Film Institute. He first broke into the movie scene in 1977 when he turned his thesis project into his first feature film \"Eraserhead,\" a black-and-white surrealist indie film that quickly gained notoriety as a midnight movie.",
      "\"Eraserhead\" attracted the attention of producer Mel Brooks, who brought Lynch aboard to direct \"The Elephant Man,\" an adaptation of the life and times of the severely deformed Joseph Merrick, telling the younger director, \"You're a crazy man. You're hired.\"",
      "\"The Elephant Man\" earned Lynch his first of three Academy Award nominations for best director, followed by \"Blue Velvet\" in 1986 and \"Mulholland Drive\" in 2001, the latter also earning Lynch a best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival, where he previously earned the festival's top prize \u2014 the Palme d'Or \u2014 for 1990's \"Wild at Heart.\"",
      "Lynch also directed the ill-fated 1984 movie adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel \"Dune.\"",
      "But for many, Lynch's most famous contribution to pop culture was his collaboration with Mark Frost on ABC's primetime drama \"Twin Peaks,\"\u00a0 which hooked viewers immediately with its sui generis combination of mystery and quirk, spurring legions to tune in weekly to find out who murdered Laura Palmer, who was played by Sheryl Lee.",
      "The show initially lasted only two seasons in the early '90s and took home three Golden Globe honors in 1991, including Best TV Series and Best Actor for Kyle MacLachlan. In 2017, the show was revisited to widespread critical acclaim in the Showtime limited series \"Twin Peaks: The Return.\"",
      "The style of his films coined the term \"Lynchian,\" referring to the juxtaposition of \"surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments.\"",
      "In 2019, Lynch received an honorary Academy Award at the Motion Picture Academy's Governors Awards, and in 2012, he received honorary degrees from the American Film Institute.",

      "Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died, the baseball commissioner's office confirmed to CBS News. He was 90.",
      "The Brewers announced Uecker died Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most difficult days in Milwaukee Brewers history.\" In a statement released by the club, Uecker's family said he had battled small cell lung cancer since early 2023.",
      "\"Even in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\" the family said.",
      "Uecker was best known as a colorful comedian and broadcaster who earned his nickname during one of his numerous appearances on Johnny Carson's late night show.",
      "Born and raised in Milwaukee, Uecker was a beloved member of the baseball community and a pillar of the sport in Wisconsin.",
      "When the Brewers clinched the NL Central title in 2024, manager Pat Murphy threw an arm around Uecker in the locker room, pulling him in tight as players white-knuckled their corks, ready to shower \"Mr. Baseball\" in Champagne.",

      "Uecker signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1956 and reached the majors in 1962. He'd last six seasons in the big leagues as a backup catcher, finishing with a .200 average and 14 homers.",
      "He won a World Series ring with St. Louis in 1964 and also played for Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
      "\"Career highlights? I had two,\" he often joked. \"I got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.\"",
      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker's initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers' most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker's broadcasts.",
      "\"There's no single person in this franchise's history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\" said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers' broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\"To be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people's families,\" Uecker once said. \"I know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That's part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\"",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\"I still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014   still think I should have gone in as a player,\" he quipped.",
      "\"Ueck\" got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt's nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt's attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson's favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \"Mr. Baseball.\" And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker's comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the '90s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom \"Mr. Belvedere.\"",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\"I'm part of American folklore, I guess,\" Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \"But I'm not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\"",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014   \"Juuuust a bit outside!\" \u2014   in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker's acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren't, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\"I don't think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\" Uecker said. \"I think people see 'Major League' and they think Harry Doyle and figure that's what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we've got a good game going, I don't mess around.\"",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\"You talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\" Selig said. \"Above all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That's what he did. He's everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\"",
      "Uecker's own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\"I signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn't have that kind of dough,\" he said. \"But he eventually scraped it up.\"",
      "Another classic: \"When I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team's dugout and they were already in street clothes.\"",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers' new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \"Uecker Seats\" high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker's honor. There's a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \"I must be in the front row!\" while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

      "Last Sunday, Demi Moore accepted her first major acting award at the Golden Globes. Watching from home was Brooke Shields \"My kids'll be like, 'Oh, it's Golden Globe night. Get the bottle of wine for Mom! Get the tequila!'\" Shields laughed. \"It's so interesting, these award shows, right? They can be torturous if you sit there and you go like, Why am I not valid enough to get that, do that, whatever?\"",
      "I asked, \"You've felt that?\"",
      "\"I've felt it my entire life.\"",
      "It can be surprising to hear that a veteran actress like Shields yearns for acceptance. Turns out she's totally human. \"I was listening to Demi, 'We've weren't the ones that ever got awards.' Like, no. I got People's Choice Awards! The people loved me.\"",
      "\"So, you get the People's Choice Award, but you wanted the Emmy, the Oscar?\"",
      "\"You just wanted, like, to be part of the group, the cool kids,\" said Shields. \"That's where the little insecure girl comes out.\"",
      "At this point in her career of six decades, the comedienne has earned the right to laugh at herself.",
      "Currently 59, Shields said she feels 38. \"I definitely feel a youthfulness that I didn't feel in my younger years,\" she said.",
      "She started modeling while wearing diapers. Later, she turned heads wearing Calvin Klein jeans. Shields was expected to sell products and say her lines, all while looking gorgeous. She delivered.",
      "But as she approaches 60, she's found a cultural script she's powerfully rejecting.",
      "\"By the time you get to 50, they've just completely written you off,\" she said. \"You are out to pasture. Society says, 'Oh, if you're not the hot twenty-something at the bar, you're an old lady.' There's this whole demo in the middle that gets just overlooked.\"",
      "It's those overlooked women for whom Shields has written her fourth book: \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old\" (to be published Tuesday by Flatiron). \"When you are someone that has been noted for looking a certain way, by virtue of just growing older, you become a disappointment, in a way,\" she said. \"I've watched people get sort of personally affronted that I dare to be 60!\"",
      "\"And what do you say to them?\"",
      "\"I just sort of feel bad for them,\" Shields said. \"And I'm a part of the problem, because I was that symbol, you know, maybe unwittingly. But I didn't set out to do that.\"",

      "In the late 2000s, Shields went to a surgeon to help reduce some labia discomfort. But after the operation, she says she found out he performed an extra procedure: an unwanted vaginal rejuvenation. \"He literally looked at me and said, like, 'I tightened you up a bit,'\" Shields said. \"And I was like, 'What?' And he just sort of was, like, boasting that he 'threw in a little bonus' for me. And I was in such shock that I just, I became numb. I didn't even know what to do.\"",

      "\"I didn't say it, I didn't say a thing. because it sounded like he wanted me to thank him,\" Shields replied. \"I didn't say anything then, and this is the first time I've said anything.\"",
      "That so-called bonus surgery has had lasting side effects. The actress and model says sex can be painful.",
      "\"This was, you know, a long time ago. We didn't know what we could fight or complain. I finally had a life and kids, and it was like, 'Dear God, I don't want that kind of attention,'\" she said.",
      "So, why is she speaking out now? \"Because I have daughters. And there's no shame around it. And the more we have those conversations with them, conversations that I never had, the more progress I think we will have as women.\"",
      "Shields is looking to make progress in other ways, too. In May, she was elected president of Actors' Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 actors and stage managers around the country. As a five-time Broadway star, she felt a responsibility to give back to a community that's embraced her.",
      "She's already taken her fight to Washington for more funding and to change tax policy. \u00a0\"It's been a learning curve,\" she said. \"It's trial by fire. I'd never gone on the Hill and met with Congressmen and Senators. But you know, producers need to take care of the people that bleed for them on a daily basis.\"",
      "Besides being a union boss, Shields is now a CEO. She'd founded the beauty brand Commence, after hearing concerns from aging women about their hair. \"They have felt overlooked, and that's just the truth,\" she said. \"They're not being marketed to.\"",
      "Asked what the hardest part of being a CEO is, Shields replied, \"Money raising. Keeping the money flowing, because you have to put it right back into the company. And you know, nobody's getting salaries yet. Least I'm not!\" she laughed.",
      "Don't ask Brooke Shields if she's ready to slow down. Age has brought wisdom, and she's just getting started.",

    "summary": "With standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" and the CBS drama \"Elsbeth,\" the acclaimed actor talks about his childhood in New Orleans, training at New York's Juilliard School, and tackling the character of Willy Loman.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a few years since Wendell Pierce attended a drama class at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. Forty years, to be exact. \"I remember it well. High windows and gray floors!\" he laughed.",
      "He's said that nothing in his career gave him as much anxiety as training at Juilliard: \"Yes, the anxiety of, you know, am I doing the right thing? I'm going into an unknown world. Will I have what it takes to be just a working actor? And so, I was reminded looking in that class, it was very touching to see these young people at a point in the journey that I recall with fondness \u2013 and with a lot of anxiety, too! But I knew I was exactly where I wanted to be.\"",
      "And it's where he belongs. At 61, Pierce is among the most prolific and respected actors of his generation, with standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Treme,\" \"Suits,\" \"Selma,\" and now, the quirky CBS drama, \"Elsbeth.\" Later this year, he'll play editor-in-chief Perry White in the newest Superman movie. He'll also take on Othello at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C.",
      "No matter the part, Pierce brings his own humanity to it. He said, \"In every role, there's a little part of Wendell in it. At the end of the run, I turn the lights down low in the dressing room and I just see the silhouette in the mirror. And I have a good cry and say goodbye. Right? I say, 'Man, you taught me so much about myself. I've learned so much from you. I hope I see you again. And I know there'll be times where I will see you again.'\"",
      "That sense of self-discovery began in his hometown of New Orleans, and the historical Black neighborhood of Pontchatrain Park. \"It was like a Black Mayberry,\" he said. \"The first Black mayor came out of there, the first Black DA. Lawyers, doctors, postal workers, maintenance men. That was the community I grew up in. It was absolutely wonderful. And it was totally destroyed. We were destroyed by Katrina. We were part of the deepest flooding. And we brought it back, and now we're on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",
      "His mother, Althea, was a beloved schoolteacher. \"She taught everybody in the neighborhood. And I just remember how, everywhere I went, I knew that I had to live up to being her son,\" Pierce said.",
      "His father, Amos Pierce, Jr., was a World War II veteran. \"He was Army unit attached to the 3rd Marines in the invasion of Saipan. And after that, his unit received medals of commendation. And because he was there with the Black unit, the officer didn't believe him when he told him. He said, 'Listen, I think we received medals.' And it was a woman who said, 'Yeah, right. You? You didn't receive anything.'\"",
      "It would take 65 years for the injustice to be corrected. \"We gave him his medals on Veteran's Day 2010,\" Pierce said. \"I tell that story to say that he was a man who loved this country even when the country didn't love him back. And even after receiving the medals, there was a great pride. He didn't let the anger destroy him. And that was a great lesson.\"",
      "Pierce sees his own life as a series of lessons \u2013 and acting is part of that journey. He said, \"Every audition for me is an opening and closing night, where you get to perform: This is what I would do with this material. You do whatever you like from this point on. And then you leave the room.\"",
      "And he says his best work \u2013 be it as Detective Bunk Moreland on \"The Wire,\" or in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" comes from the writing. He said, \"The really good material is the thing that will define it, you know, and make it classic. Something that speaks to people across time and place no matter where you are, that's gonna speak to people years from now.\"",
      "A career highlight was in 2022, when Pierce became the first Black actor to play Willy Loman on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\"",
      "Why does he think it took so long? \"The ignorance of biases and bigotry, and when people just don't have the ability to see others' humanity,\" Pierce said. \"And it's something that people are very conscious of at times, and then sometimes they're not very conscious of it.\"",

      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "And it's Pierce's own compassion that draws people towards him, like Carrie Preston, his co-star on \"Elsbeth.\" She said, \"This kind of connection isn't always guaranteed. We've got it here. I'm grateful for it.\"",
      "And it's what his fellow Juilliard classmate Bradley Whitford recalled when he surprised Pierce with a message during our interview: \"Wendell, I miss you. I love you. I am so proud of you, not only for the great actor that you are and the dear friend, but what an amazing citizen you are. I love you!\"",
      "\"That's very special,\" said Pierce. \"Brad and I, we're part of a very special group here at Juilliard, our class. You know, when you go through the fire together, you're connected forever.\"",
      "Pierce has said he wants to make his mark. I asked, \"Do you think that you have? And what is that mark? What do you want to leave for people?\"",
      "\"I was afraid that I may not have the opportunity to leave my mark, that my best days were behind me,\" he replied. \"I had that fear, and I tapped into that fear when I did 'Death of a Salesman.' And while I still have the fear, now I have courage.",
      "\"I hope I can have an impact on someone else that way, the way they have an impact on me.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 17:38:39 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal court had ordered the Biden administration to take action over fluoride's potential health risks at higher levels.",
    "story": [
      "Attorneys for the Biden administration said Friday they would seek to challenge a court loss last year that could pave the way for the Trump administration to ban the use of fluoride in water.",
      "The Biden administration's notice, filed Friday with the federal district court in San Francisco, comes just days ahead of a Jan. 21 deadline for the appeal.",
      "While last year's ruling did not order the Environmental Protection Agency to ban water fluoridation, opponents say it carved out a \"clear legal pathway\" giving the federal government authority to force local governments to stop adding the chemical to the water supply.",
      "Public health experts have long defended fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. The American Dental Association said last year that research shows it is a \"safe, beneficial and cost-effective public health measure\" for preventing cavities.",
      "District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled last year that evidence showed fluoride was \"hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" but stopped short of ordering the EPA to ban the practice.",
      "The judge said he only had the authority under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, to direct the EPA to take action against the risk, but not to prescribe the specifics of its response, which could range from a national warning to an outright ban.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that the new administration will use the authority that it has under TSCA to follow the lead of Europe and to implement a nationwide ban on water fluoridation,\" Michael Connett, an attorney for the groups Fluoride Action Network and Food & Water Watch that had sued the EPA, told CBS News.",
      "Attorneys for the federal government did not say what they plan to argue in its appeal. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment on the filing.",
      "It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide whether to continue the appeal.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, has advocated for removing fluoride from public water supplies and said last year that Trump intends to call for an end to fluoridation.",
      "Trump has said he was open to the idea but has not yet detailed plans. A spokesperson for the president-elect did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"If the new administration did want to take a different course with respect to fluoridation policies, it has unquestionably the authority to stand down on this appeal, and to initiate rulemaking proceeding to address the risk of fluoridation,\" said Connett.",
      "The court ruling in September stemmed in large part from a review published by the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program, which concluded that \"higher levels of fluoride exposure\" are associated with lower IQ in children.",
      "While those concerning levels are higher than what is typically added to the U.S. water supply, some opponents worry that the varied ways children consume drinks and food made with fluoridated water could add up to exposure that is too high for many kids.",
      "Fluoridation opponents argue that modern toothpaste is enough to make up for stopping water fluoridation, citing communities that do not add the chemical to their water supply.",
      "Not all local governments have stuck with their decision to stop fluoridating water. In Canada, Calgary's city council decided to reintroduce fluoride after cavity rates worsened in children.",
      "\"I hope this is sufficiently convincing to the leadership in the city of Calgary, Alberta, that they see the harm that stopping fluoridation has happened to the children of their city,\" said University of California San Francisco Professor Howard Pollick, in a post by the American Dental Association in 2021, after a study on higher cavity rates in the city.",

      "Close to 2.3 million seniors in Medicare are using the semaglutide medications, branded as Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy by Novo Nordisk. Medicare says that the drug added up to more than $14 billion covered by the program over the last year, the most of any medication in this round.",
      "The next costliest was GSK's asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medication Trelegy Ellipta, at around $5.1 billion. Around 1.25 million seniors are using that drug.",

Those reduced prices go into effect next year.",
      "President Biden has touted the program, created by the Inflation Reduction Act he signed into law in 2022, as one of his term's signature accomplishments.",

      "\"That is why we are deeply concerned about the price-setting process, which could negatively impact patients' ability to access their medicines and threatens to stifle future scientific development of life-changing medicines,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The drugmaker also criticized Medicare's grouping of Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus together, arguing that they would not qualify for the drug talks individually. Brooks-LaSure defended Medicare's move to group the three together, saying the \"law is very clear.\"",

      "That law requires Medicare to essentially make a list of eligible drugs for the program, and then select the drugs\u00a0that make up the 15 highest in spending from Part D.",

      "Companies say they are working to update their products to comply with the Food and Drug Administration's decision Wednesday to ban the artificial food dye Red 3, after the agency said it was revoking the additive's authorization over concerns it was causing cancer in rats.",
      "While the agency says that studies show the way Red 3 causes cancer in rats does not occur in humans, the law still requires additives that cause cancer in animals to be pulled from the market even if they are not proven to pose a risk to humans as well.",
      "The FDA says that food companies will have until Jan. 15, 2027 to stop using the dye. Drugmakers will have an extra year, until January 2028, to comply with the change.",

      "Red 3, also known as erythrosine, Acid Red 51 or FD&C Red No. 3, is often used in candy. But other companies also use Red 3 to color a wide variety of products, from drinks to vegetarian meats, and will be forced to rework their recipes.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:14:24 -0500",
    "summary": "It will be up to the returning Trump administration to decide whether to finalize the rule.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is moving to cut out addictive nicotine from cigarettes, according to a long-awaited proposed regulation released Wednesday.",
      "The rule aims to force the nearly 12% of Americans still using combustible tobacco products to switch to less dangerous alternatives, like vaping electronic cigarettes or using nicotine lozenges, or quit altogether while ending rates of youth starting to smoke traditional cigarettes.",
      "\"The proposed product standard would limit the addictiveness of the most toxic and widely used tobacco products, which would have significant public health benefits for all age groups,\" the agency wrote in the\u00a0proposed rule.",
      "Though vaping rates have climbed in recent years, fewer adults vape than smoke traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6% of adults use e-cigarettes.",
      "It will now be up to the returning Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize this measure, which was first floated during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At the time, the head of the FDA called it \"one of the most important actions I could take to advance public health.\"",
      "\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "A related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.",
      "The FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.",
      "Agency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.",
      "\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "Tobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.",
      "Why didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?",
      "Progress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.",
      "\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.",
      "The FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.",
      "Zeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.",
      "\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.",
      "Under President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024. Zeller said he delivered the plan in one of his last acts before retiring, and was not sure why the Biden administration failed to finalize the rule.",
      "\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.",
      "Califf defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"",
      "\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.",
      "How can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?",
      "Zeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.",
      "\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.",
      "The Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.",
      "A major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015\u00a0that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.",
      "\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.",
      "Other companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.",
      "While feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.",
      "If successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:31:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The red food dye is used in products ranging from candies to vegetarian meats.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday it had decided to revoke Red 3's authorization to be added to foods, over concerns about how the food coloring dye has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.",
      "FDA officials have telegraphed the decision for months. While the agency has long said that it did not think evidence of Red 3 causing cancer applied to humans, officials said their hand was forced by a law requiring the agency to pull additives that are cancerous in animals.",
      "\"The Delaney Clause is clear; the FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, referring to the law.",
      "A post on the FDA's website states that Red 3's use in food or drugs \"puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\"",
      "Hundreds of food brands, including products ranging from candy and fruit cups to snack chips and tomato sauce, have contained Red 3 at some point, according to databases maintained by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0and the nonprofit\u00a0Environmental Working Group, as well as nutrition labels disclosed by food companies.",
      "Wednesday's decision stems from a petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of other groups in 2022, calling for the additive to be pulled from the market. Food brands will have until January 2027 to stop using the dye.",
      "The group has also championed a move by California in 2023 to ban the food dye, which is already banned from use in cosmetics.",
      "\"The primary purpose of food dyes is to make candy, drinks, and other processed foods more attractive. When the function is purely aesthetic, why accept any cancer risk?\" said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement.",
      "While the group has highlighted Red 3's link to cancer in pushes to ban the additive, it is concerned over a different health concern \u2014 the possibility that artificial food dyes could be causing hyperactivity in children \u2014 that has fueled opposition to this and another dye called Red 40 used in many U.S. food products.",
      "An influential review by California''s Environmental Protection Agency of studies on synthetic food dyes, including Red 3, concluded in 2021 that colorants \"can impact neurobehavior in some children.\"",
      "What foods and drinks contain Red 3?",
      "Red 3 has been authorized for use in at least some foods by countries around the world, according to the International Association of Color Manufacturers, under other names like erythrosine or E 127. In Europe, Red 3 is only permitted for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.",
      "In the U.S., Red 3 is used in some candies, including Jelly Belly's Candy Corn, Tootsie's Dubble Bubble ball gum and Ring Pop's strawberry and berry blast flavors. Other foods also use Red 3, like Del Monte cherry mixed fruit cups, MorningStar Farms vegetarian Bacon Strips and Pillsbury's birthday cake cookie dough.",
      "Several drinks rely on Red 3 as well, among them Ensure's creamy peach nutrition shake and Nesquik's strawberry lowfat milk.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the candy industry pledged to comply with the FDA's guidance and safety standards. Industry groups have been calling on the agency to step up its regulation of food additives, citing concerns that a vacuum left by FDA inaction could lead to a frustrating patchwork of state laws for national food brands.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework. We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety,\" said the National Confections Association's statement.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the federal department that will oversee the FDA, has been critical of the agency for not moving to curb use of certain food additives.",
      "Kennedy and his allies have\u00a0also called for\u00a0tightening the FDA's approach to regulating food additives, which critics have derided as a \"loophole\" allowing in concerning ingredients. That process is separate from artificial colors like Red 3 and Red 40, which must jump through steep hurdles to gain the FDA's authorization and are carefully tested for purity before being used in the market.",

    "summary": "The death risk goes up to 1 in 100 for those who drink alcohol nine times per week, the report found.",
    "story": [
      "Consuming more than one drink a day results in a steep increase of the risk of premature death, a new federal review has concluded. The draft report was published Tuesday ahead of a major update to influential federal guidelines on how much alcohol Americans should drink.",
      "\"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week,\" the report's authors concluded, in a final draft published by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The review is one of two written by committees of outside experts to inform this year's update to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The other was published last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",
      "The upcoming guidelines are important because the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies often rely on the recommendations to justify new rules, like on how to label food and drinks. Men are currently recommended to limit intake to no more than two drinks per day and women are recommended to limit to one drink per day.",
      "\"Once you're over a drink a day, your risk of dying from alcohol is already above one percent. Some people may think that doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of a public health guideline, that would be really, really high,\" said Dr. Timothy Naimi, director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and one of the authors of the report.",
      "Naimi was careful to say that the report was \"not endorsing any level of risk\" caused by drinking, but pointed to other countries and health regulations that have used 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 death risks as thresholds to set rules.",
      "It is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will incorporate the findings of the latest report into any updated guidelines. In 2020, the Trump administration rejected a call by its outside expert panel to recommend limiting drinking for all Americans to no more than once per day, saying the \"emerging evidence\" did not support the move.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade coalition that represents spirits producers, called in a statement co-signed by other industry groups on the federal government to reject the findings of the panel.",
      "\"Today's report is the product of a flawed, opaque and unprecedented process, rife with bias and conflicts of interest,\" the statement said,\" accusing some of the experts on the federal panel of having ties to international anti-alcohol advocacy organizations.",
      "\"Congress never authorized or appropriated money for the panel or its work, and numerous letters from Congress and industry have voiced serious concerns over the process,\" the statement said.",
      "Alcohol linked to deaths from cancer, injuries, other causes",
      "The report was designed to weigh all of the data on a range of diseases and injuries, and boiled down a complex web of studies that have looked at alcohol's health risks and benefits into \"alcohol-attributable death\" estimates.",
      "This modeling is likely underestimating the true health risks of alcohol, Naimi said, given limits in how researchers can study its health impacts.",
      "Risks can also vary widely from person to person, the report cautions, meaning some harms can be very small for some even if they add up to substantial risks at the public health level.",
      "\"The overall effect of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality is dependent upon the risk of diseases and injuries that are causally related to alcohol. These risks are affected by numerous factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, hepatitis infection, and genetics,\" the report states.",
      "At one drink a day, the report estimated that injuries and cancer added up to the biggest contributors of the risk for a premature death.",
      "For men, injuries made up a substantial portion of the risk of dying. This includes a variety of accidents, road injuries and intentional harm, like suicide and violence linked to drinking.",
      "Cancer, which was next largest factor, made up a third of the additional risk of death for men.",
      "For women consuming one drink a day, the risk of death from cancer was statistically similar or larger compared to the increased risk of fatal injuries.",
      "Increased risk of a number of cancers \u2014 colorectal, female breast cancer, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and esophagus \u2014 \"begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use,\" the report states.",
      "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued an advisory earlier this month calling for a warning about the risk of cancer to be included on alcoholic beverages.",
      "Liver disease poses the next highest risk, and can be especially risky for people with other underlying conditions like hepatitis C that make people vulnerable.",
      "One risk that was lower in people drinking once per day, compared with never drinking, was for ischemic stroke. But that apparent benefit virtually disappears at two drinks per day.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration released on Tuesday its long-awaited proposal to require food manufacturers to put some nutrition facts on the front of packages, in a bid to nudge Americans and food companies towards healthier diets in line with similar pushes in other countries.",
      "FDA's new \"nutrition info box\" focuses on telling people whether levels of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar are \"high\" or \"medium\" or \"low\" as well as the percentage for each serving.",
      "The proposal will be open for public comment for 120 days. It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize the rule.",
      "After that, the FDA says that large food companies earning more than $10 million annually will have three years to comply with the rule. Smaller food brands will have an additional year.",
      "Up to $154 million will be spent by the food industry over the next decade to relabel their products with the new box, the FDA estimates.",
      "The agency also estimates many food brands may also spend millions more dollars to try to rework their products, changing their recipes to avoid being called out as having too much of an unhealthy nutrient.",
      "\"We assume there may be manufacturers who would want to reformulate to maybe move from the high category into the medium category, or the medium category into the low category,\" Rebecca Buckner, the associate deputy director for human food policy at the FDA, told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump's pick to head the federal department that oversees the FDA, has been sharply critical of federal nutrition officials for not doing enough to help Americans eat healthier diets and crack down on the food industry.",
      "Kennedy has not specifically addressed the proposal. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Why only saturated fat, sodium and added sugars?",
      "The FDA said it will require the box to only call out saturated fat, sodium and added sugars. Food manufacturers would not be able to put other nutrients inside the FDA's information box.",

      "Designs they tested with focus groups that included nutrients Americans need more of, like fiber and calcium, confused participants.",
      "The FDA said it is still weighing whether calories should be incorporated into the label and acknowledged that some food brands are already voluntarily listing the information on the front.",
      "What determines \"high,\" \"medium\" and \"low\" levels?",
      "FDA officials said Tuesday that levels of saturated fat, sodium or added sugars will be deemed as \"high\" if they are above 20% in the daily value, a measurement of how much Americans eat each day in the \"reference\" diet. Medium was set at between 6% and 19% of the daily value. And low is 5% and below.",
      "Agency officials have used these benchmarks for \"high\" and \"low\" for decades, dating back to the formulation of the nutrition facts label back in the 1990s.",
      "At the time, officials decided against including the \"interpretive descriptions\" in the nutrition facts label. But the agency said recent data shows many Americans do not understand the percentages.",
      "\"It's really based on longstanding usage,\" McKinnon said.",
      "What will it look like?",
      "The FDA says food makers will be required to put the labels \"somewhere in the top third\" of the front of the box.",
      "The box also uses the same Helvetica font used in the nutrition facts on the back of the package and must comply with a range of more detailed rules to avoid it from being too small or obscured by other designs on the package.",
      "Some other design decisions were also abandoned during the focus group testing process, the FDA said.",
      "For example, previous mockups using the colors red, yellow and green to call out different levels did not make a statistically significant difference in helping people interpret the box.",

      "That is more than double the 13.52% of tests coming back positive reached during the peak of last season's wave in March, according to data from public health laboratories around the country tallied by the CDC.",
      "Labs usually test samples of sick people's stool for the virus, which can be diagnosed up to 10 days after symptoms begin. The virus can also be found in other samples, including contaminated food or drinks that can spread the virus.",
      "Rates of norovirus in that CDC system have reached levels at or above last season's peak in all regions of the country. Norovirus test positivity rates look to be the worst in the Midwest, in a grouping of states spanning Kansas through Michigan.",
      "Since most people sick with norovirus get better without needing to go to the doctor, a majority of cases go unreported in the U.S. Instead, health authorities and experts use other measurements, such as the rate of positive tests, to track trends of the virus.",
      "Data from WastewaterSCAN's sewer sampling also suggests norovirus rates in recent weeks have been highest in the Midwest as well as the Northeast. Figures published by private testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also above previous seasonal peaks for norovirus.",
      "Why are norovirus cases so high in 2025?",
      "While norovirus rates always worsen during the colder months, in recent years most trends tracking norovirus did not reach their peak until March or April.",
      "That's different from seasons leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, which scrambled many usual seasonal patterns of germs. During that time, norovirus outbreaks often reached peak levels as early as December and January.",
      "Experts say this year's early and steep surge of cases is being driven by a new strain of norovirus called GII.17[P17], which has displaced a previous strain that had dominated previous waves of the virus in the U.S. for a decade.",
      "That new strain has been spotted everywhere around the country, including in many cruise ship outbreaks, a CDC official told CBS News. Lower population immunity to GII.17[P17] could explain this year's unusual wave of the virus.",
      "More than 7 in 10 outbreaks have been linked to this new norovirus strain this season, according to the latest CDC figures.",

      "More than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the U.S. died last quarter because of bird flu, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows, marking the worst toll inflicted on America's egg supply since the outbreak began.",
      "The record number of chicken deaths, which includes those birds culled when infection is discovered in a flock, come as figures show egg prices have soared to the highest they have been in years, driven in large part by the virus.",
      "\"Unlike in past years, in 2024, all major production systems experienced significant losses including conventional caged, cage-free, and certified organic types,\" a USDA report said this month.",
      "Taxpayers will pick up the tab for the lost birds. To incentivize farmers to quickly report and stomp out the virus, a USDA program pays producers for the eggs and poultry they cull.",
      "Last year, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said it had spent $1.25 billion on payments to farmers since the outbreak started in 2022.",
      "Why are bird flu cases high right now in poultry?",
      "U.S. officials brace every winter for upticks in bird flu because migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south during the colder months.",
      "It's also easier for the virus to spread in the winter. Heat and sunlight degrade the virus on surfaces, the USDA says.",
      "This winter has been different because a strain of the bird flu virus has spilled over into dairy herds too, leading to hundreds of infected herds.",
      "Authorities suspect the virus has been hitching a ride in droplets of contaminated raw milk. Those are ferried between farms by workers' clothing, equipment and animals shared between farms.",
      "California has been hit especially hard in recent months, forcing the state to declare a state of emergency to try to respond to the bird flu outbreak.",
      "This winter's surge of bird flu is from a different virus than the uptick of seasonal flu infections that also drives humans to emergency rooms every winter.",
      "While bird flu led to millions of dead poultry over the past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied only 66 confirmed human cases in the U.S. from bird flu viruses.",
      "Most American cases of bird flu have been mild. A majority were farm workers who were infected after close contact with animals infected by a bird flu strain that spilled over into dairy cows in late 2023.",
      "Researchers think\u00a0this bird flu strain mutated to be milder to humans than other variants spreading in the wild. Those other strains usually cause more severe disease when they jump into humans.",
      "Can animals be vaccinated for bird flu?",
      "The USDA announced this week it is drawing up a new stockpile of poultry vaccines. That vaccine will target the D1.1 strain of the virus, which has been spreading in wild birds and was recently to blame for a fatal human case in Louisiana.",
      "But officials said it's unlikely the vaccine will be used. The Biden administration has been weighing the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu for years.",
      "That is different from plans to potentially vaccinate cows for bird flu, which the USDA says appears \"more feasible and more likely to be successful\" in battling the virus. Seven potential vaccines are now being tested in field safety trials, the department said.",
      "One major hurdle has been the fear that vaccines will only hide the symptoms of the otherwise highly lethal disease in birds. That could result in export restrictions from countries afraid the virus could spread to them through poultry products.",
      "In 2023, the USDA banned imports of some products from Europe after authorities announced they would start vaccinating some poultry for bird flu.",
      "Spread of the virus through contaminated meat in the U.S. has already happened during this year's outbreak at least twice: raw pet food made from sick animals was linked to an outbreak that killed cats in California and Oregon.",
      "A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told CBS News that the agency is now urging the animal food supply chain to take steps to curb the threat of the virus spreading, including heat treatment to kill off the virus and avoiding using infected animals.",
      "\"All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. could be in for a rude awakening come Sunday if they suddenly find the enormously popular video-sharing app is inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.",
      "Lawmakers and U.S. officials have sounded the alarm for years about the supposed risks that TikTok's ties to China pose to national security, and Congress moved last year to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",
      "That deadline is now here, with no sign of a sale in sight. TikTok's last-ditch legal challenge failed on Friday, when the Supreme Court said the law does not violate the First Amendment.",
      "The Biden White House said it will leave enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration, and President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to \"save\" the app. But TikTok has hinted that it could still take itself offline once the law is in effect, a move that would leave content creators and users in the lurch as the company seeks a way to get back on firm legal footing.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that \"the statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",

      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

      "\"The act's prohibitions and divestiture requirement are designed to prevent China \u2014 a designated foreign adversary \u2014 from leveraging its control over ByteDance Ltd. to capture the personal data of U.S. TikTok users. This objective qualifies as an important government interest under intermediate scrutiny,\" the court said, referencing the middle standard applied by courts to assess the constitutionality of a law.",
      "Under intermediate scrutiny, a challenged law must further an important government interest and be substantially related to that interest to be upheld. It is a less demanding standard than strict scrutiny, the highest level of judicial review, and more stringent than rational-basis review, the lowest, most lenient tier.",
      "The court noted that TikTok \"collects extensive personal information from and about its users,\" including location data and contact lists. The justices reiterated the government's concerns that such information may allow China to track the locations of federal employees, craft dossiers of information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.",

      "Its provisions \"clearly serve the government's data collection interest,\" the court said, and are not broader than needed to address concerns about China's access to Americans' personal information.",
      "The court noted the government's interest in preventing China from having control over TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and its ability to covertly alter the content appearing on the app for users in the U.S. But it said the record in the case \"adequately supports the conclusion that Congress would have passed the challenged provisions based on the data collection justification alone.\"",
      "According to Congress and the Biden administration, the court said, ByteDance uses data collected from TikTok to train the app's recommendation algorithm and would not agree to stop collecting U.S. users' data or sending it to China. The government also noted the challenges with monitoring data-sharing between TikTok and its parent company.",

      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" he wrote. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them.

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a new law that would lead to a ban of the social media platform TikTok, clearing the way for the widely popular app to shutter in the U.S. as soon as Sunday.",
      "\"We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate the petitioners' First Amendment rights,\" the court said in a unanimous unsigned opinion, which upholds the lower court decision against TikTok. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch wrote separately, with Gorsuch agreeing with the outcome of the case but splitting with the court's reasoning.",
      "What happens to TikTok when the Sunday deadline arrives is still unclear. Following the ruling, the White House said the Biden administration would not enforce the ban on Sunday, and would leave it to the Trump administration. President-elect Donald Trump wrote in a social media post that he would make his \"decision on TikTok\" in \"the not too distant future,\" but that he \"must have time to review the situation.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that \"the statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "The court's ruling comes days before the law, which was passed with bipartisan majorities of Congress last April, is set to take effect. TikTok and a group of content creators who use the app argued the law infringes on their free speech rights, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in their bid to block it one week ago.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "\"The challenged provisions further an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression and do not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further that interest,\" the court said, adding that the law's requirements that TikTok either divest or face a ban are designed to prevent China from gaining access to the personal data from the app's U.S. users.",
      "Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the law requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance, its parent company, or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had urged the court to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office.",
      "In response to the ruling, Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that it was \"expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\"",
      "With the Supreme Court declining to throw TikTok a lifeline, the immediate effects on access to the app as of Sunday's deadline aren't clear. Reuters reported Wednesday that the company planned to shut down for U.S. users once the ban takes effect. Those trying to open the app would be greeted with a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the new law, according to the report.",
      "Many users have begun downloading their videos and data from TikTok in anticipation of a ban and migrating to other platforms, including the Chinese-owned RedNote.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "Trump could decline to enforce the ban, but companies like Apple and Google could still potentially face steep fines if they host the app in violation of the law. During arguments last week, the government noted there is a five-year statute of limitations for violations of the law, meaning a future administration could punish offenders.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in a video that the company \"will do everything in its power to ensure our platform thrives\" for users. He also explicitly thanked Trump for \"his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"",
      "\"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\" Chew said.",
      "TikTok and the Supreme Court",
      "Congress and the Biden administration have raised national security concerns about TikTok for years. Federal employees cannot have the app on their government-issued phones, and a majority of states have barred the platform on state government devices.",
      "The law aims to prevent China from collecting substantial amounts of data from the platform's 170 million U.S. users and covertly manipulate the content on TikTok to harm the U.S. by sowing discord and division, federal officials have said.",
      "But TikTok, which curates short videos for users through a powerful recommendation algorithm, said it is a U.S. company that is protected by the First Amendment from Congress' attempt to ban the platform.",
      "During arguments, the justices appeared poised to uphold the law, though several expressed concerns that it could conflict with the First Amendment. Still, many of the court's members seemed to agree that the law targeted TikTok's ownership by a foreign company, ByteDance, instead of the speech shared on the platform.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the U.S. government, said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the Supreme Court's decision would be \"enormously consequential.\" If the companies are forced to cut ties, he said, TikTok \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. Other social media platforms have tried to replicate the algorithm, but have been unable to match TikTok's, according to Jeffrey Fisher, who represented the creators. China has said it is opposed to the sale of TikTok's algorithm.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Jan. 19, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores. If TikTok doesn't shut down voluntarily, experts told CBS News that the experience for users who already have it on their phones would likely suffer with time because they would no longer receive software updates.",
      "Several of the justices on the liberal and conservative wings of the bench repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's collection of data from its American users and the Chinese government's access to that personal information.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Francisco, referring to ByteDance.",
      "Congress found that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work and ensure it has the power to access private data the company holds, Roberts said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, warned of the future implications of the Chinese government having access to data from the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every month.",
      "Congress and the president, he said, were worried that China \"would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or the State Department. Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Francisco claimed that TikTok would \"have to go mute\" unless it severs ties from ByteDance, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back on that characterization of the law.",
      "\"If TikTok were to, post-divestiture or whatever, pre-divestiture, come up with its own algorithm, then when the divestiture happened, it could still operate. It doesn't say, 'TikTok, you can't speak,'\" she said, adding that TikTok can remain in the U.S. as long as it's not associated with ByteDance.",
      "In its opinion, the high court focused primarily on the data collection concerns raised by Congress and the Justice Department, finding that the law is sufficiently tailored to address the U.S. government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary, China, from collecting \"vast swaths\" of sensitive information from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "For Americans who rely on TikTok to exchange ideas about all manner of topics, from politics to entertainment to the news, the stakes of the case are high. Creators who challenged the law said they use it to sell products, reach thousands of people and create a nationwide community.",
      "\"That's our editor and publisher of choice that we think best disseminates our speech,\" Fisher said.",
      "Trump attempted to effectively ban TikTok during his first term in office because of national security concerns, though his executive order targeting the app was blocked by a federal court and then rescinded by Mr. Biden. But the president-elect has reversed course on his view of the platform.",
      "Trump told Newsmax in an interview this week that he's \"not opposed\" to TikTok and said his campaign's use of the app helped him win over young voters in the November presidential election.",
      "\"I had a very good experience with TikTok,\" he said.",

      "The civil suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Walgreen Boots Alliance, Walgreen Co. and its various subsidiaries   alleges the pharmacy giant knowingly filled millions of unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances from approximately August 2012 through to the present. Walgreens allegedly filled prescriptions for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, the lawsuit said, including early refills among other prescriptions.",
      "\"Our complaint alleges that Walgreens pharmacists filled millions of controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated the prescriptions were highly likely to be unlawful, and that Walgreens systematically pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions, including controlled substance prescriptions, without taking the time needed to confirm their validity,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a statement. \"These practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\"",
      "Walgreens pharmacists filled these unlawful prescriptions despite clear \"red flags,\" the complaint alleges, and the pharmacy giant ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources that its stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, the suit claims.",
      "Pharmacists were pressured to fill prescriptions quickly without taking the time needed to confirm each prescription's validity, the complaint said. Walgreens also deprived pharmacists of crucial information and prevented them from warning one another about certain prescribers.",
      "Four different whistleblowers who previously worked for Walgreens in various parts of the country filed whistleblower actions, the statement said.",
      "Walgreens responded to the lawsuit in a statement on its website which read that it stands \"behind our pharmacists, dedicated healthcare professionals who live in the communities they serve, filling legitimate prescriptions for FDA-approved medications written by DEA-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\"",

    "title": "As Biden exits, how will he be remembered for his handling of the U.S. economy?",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 17:25:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy rebounded strongly from the COVID shock, but the U.S. continues to grapple with a cost-of-living crisis and spiraling federal debt.",
    "story": [
      "As President Biden prepares to depart the White House, he leaves an economic legacy marked by a historic pandemic that paralyzed consumers and businesses across the U.S.",
      "After inheriting a COVID-scarred nation in 2021, Mr. Biden focused on righting the economy, a strategy that economists told CBS MoneyWatch is visible in the country's solid GDP growth and low unemployment. By several key measures, the economy is stronger than it was four years ago: The jobless rate is near a 50-year low, wages are growing and the U.S. managed to sidestep a recession widely expected by many on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve moved to curb inflation by ratcheting up interest rates.",
      "\"He should have a strong legacy when it comes to the economy,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said of Mr. Biden. \"He inherited an economy that was flat on its back because of the COVID pandemic, and he's leaving an economy that's flying high, at least in the aggregate,\"",
      "Zandi added, \"How much he can take credit for that, it's a reasonable debate, but I think he deserves a lot of credit.\"",
      "Zandi pointed to several pieces of landmark legislation passed under Biden, including the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, as helping to stabilize the nation and produce growth that has surpassed most other major economies around the world.",
      "Biden also score some wins on health care, such as a new $2,000 out-of-pocket\u00a0spending cap on prescriptions for Medicare enrollees and a $35 cap on insulin prices.",
      "Yet in retrospect, he added, additional trillions in federal stimulus may have played a part in the soaring inflation of the last few years, which Zandi said was also fueled by the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "ARPA \"was very controversial, but at the end of the day it got the economy back to full employment,\" Zandi said.",
      "Deep structural problems",
      "Although Biden's policies were key in helping the economy recover from the pandemic, millions of Americans continue to struggle with a cost-of-living crisis worsened by the hottest inflation in four decades. Long-term challenges in housing affordability only deepened during the Biden administration, while U.S. wealth inequality today remains near record levels.",
      "To be sure, health care, child care and education costs have outpaced inflation\u00a0for years, weighing on millions households and making many families vulnerable to even minor downturns. But the inflation spike in 2022 intensified these existing financial pains, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank.",
      "\"The American economy for a long time has been characterized by a lack of affordability for the biggest ticket items,\" Owens said. \"Housing has been out of reach, health care has been expensive, child care is expensive \u2014 that was all true before Biden.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Biden plan to sweep away student loan debt was largely\u00a0shot down by the courts, although the Department of Education used other means to offer relief to millions of borrowers. Housing costs continued to soar under Biden due to rising home values as well as soaring mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to battle inflation.",
      "The upshot: Under Biden, many households remained dogged by the same long-term pocketbook issues that have prevailed for decades under previous presidential administrations. During the pandemic, the soaring cost of essentials like food, fuel and rent only deepened the country's widespread precarity \u2014 a gnawing sense of financial insecurity that has left tens of millions of Americans vulnerable to job losses, medical problems and even modest economic dips.",
      "Ballooning debt",
      "Biden's legislative wins \u2014 ARPA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act in 2022 \u2014 added trillions in additional federal spending. The idea underlying these efforts was to rejuvenate the U.S. economy by investing in key sectors, such as by building semiconductor chip plants, rebuilding U.S. roads or accelerating the shift toward green energy.",
      "But those efforts will likely take years to pay off, economists note. In the meantime, the nation's debt has ballooned to a record $36.2 trillion as of mid-January due to a combination of fiscal stimulus authorized by both Biden and Trump, as well as Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "With federal spending outpacing revenues, the nation will face tough choices, such as whether to raise taxes, cut federal programs or both. Asked to describe Biden's economic legacy, Cato Institute vice president of general economics Scott Lincicome summarized it in one word: \"Frustrating.\"",
      "\"If you could look at the basic fundamentals \u2014 economic growth, jobs \u2014 things have been pretty good,\" Lincicome, who describes himself as a \"libertarian free marketer,\" added. \"But if you look beneath the hood, there are some rather significant problems.\"",
      "Chief among them are the nation's spiraling debt, Lincicome said. Treasury yields have been rising ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, partly due to concerns that the U.S. could struggle in coming years to service its debt.",
      "\"In terms of what Trump inherits \u2014 and it's not just Biden's fault, Trump did a lot of COVID spending, too \u2014 but we're now at a point where you can see bond markets are chirping, and you can see inflation has remained stubbornly higher than we would have hoped,\" Lincicome noted. \"The [Congressional Budget Office] and a lot of other folks agree that the debt is a pretty pressing issue.\"",
      "Trump's economy on Jan. 20",
      "Despite such concerns, the economists interviewed by CBS MoneyWatch say that Trump will inherit a strong economy when he's inaugurated. The nation's unemployment rate is 4.1%, down from 6.4% when Biden took office in January of 2021. In another plus for workers, average hourly earnings through December rose\u00a03.9%, keeping pay growth\u00a0ahead of consumer prices, which are up 2.9% over the last year.",
      "Not surprising, then, that Zandi and Lincicome had the same advice for the Trump administration in how it handles the U.S. economy: \"Do no harm.\"",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is do nothing,\" Zandi said. \"Biden got a basket case economy and he's bequeathing an economy that is operating at full tilt.\"",
      "For his part, Trump has signaled his intent to reshape the economy through a combination of steeper tariffs, deeper tax cuts, fewer federal regulations and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"Joe Biden's legacy is marred by crippling inflation, a migrant crime invasion and American weakness on the world stage,\" Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Thankfully, in just five days, President Trump will usher in a new Golden Age of American success and carry out his mandate to make America wealthy, safe, strong and great again.\"",
      "Economists view some of Trump's stated plans as potentially inflationary, although some question whether the president-elect will follow through with all of them, such as a broad-based tariff on all imports.",
      "\"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a December research note.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration wants to extend his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), an effort the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected could add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Trump has vowed that his tariffs would raise enough money to cover the tax cuts, a proposition that economists assess as unlikely.",
      "Tariffs could raise \"a few hundred billion, maybe, but that's total, and you're still in a massive hole,\" Lincicome noted.",
      "American oligarchs",
      "Extending the tax cuts would also likely favor the nation's wealthiest households, given that the TCJA cut taxes for top earners far more than for low- or middle-income Americans. During the past four years, America's richest people have seen their wealth soar, with Elon Musk \u2014 the world's richest person and a close adviser and backer of Trump \u2014 now worth $450 billion, more than double his $175 billion net worth when Biden was inaugurated in 2021, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his farewell message on Wednesday, Biden warned that the growing concentration of wealth in the U.S. poses a serious risk to the nation.",
      "\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.",
      "That's unlikely to change under Trump, economists predicted \"The big story of American inequality is a simple one: It's the takeoff in top incomes,\" Owens noted.",
      "She believes that \"Until we tax the top, we will have runaway income inequality.\"",

    "summary": "JSB and Perdue Farms agreed to settlements of $4 million each, while QSA, which employed 54 children, will pay $400,000.",
    "story": [
      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \"stamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\" while putting the new administration on notice.",
      "Trump claims Biden lost track of over 300,000 migrant children. Here's a fact check.",
      "Trump claims Biden lost track of over 300,000 migrant children. Here's a fact check.",
      "\"You're just going to have to keep an eye on whether this administration decides to make a total U-turn and say, it's okay for children to be exploited in these dangerous industries and get injured and die and have their futures robbed,\" said Berkowitz, who is now a fellow at George Washington University focused on labor issues.",
      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",

      "Teen's death in Wisconsin sawmill highlights \"21st century problem\" across the U.S.",
      "That PSSI case got started after one 13-year-old suffered a\u00a0serious chemical burn\u00a0from the caustic chemicals used to clean the JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, every night. But then investigators found more and more examples of PSSI employing children.",
      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",
      "\"The Department of Labor is determined to stop our nation's children from being endangered in jobs for which they should never be hired and to leverage our enforcement work to affect industries,\" said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.",
      "Dangerous conditions",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following\u00a0the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation's largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota.",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \"QSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\" he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\"",
      "Perdue was employing children at a Virginia plant using dangerous knives and other tools to slaughter chicken.",
      "The JBS agreement didn't include a finding that children were working directly for that company, but there have been examples at its plants.",
      "\"The Department of Labor has made clear that too often, companies look the other way and claim that their staffing agency, or their subcontractor or supplier is responsible. But everyone has a responsibility to keep children \u2014 our most vulnerable workers \u2014 safe,\" the Department said.",
      "Hundreds of ongoing investigations",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",
      "That includes steps like training all managers about how to spot underage applicants and avoid hiring them. False identification documents continue to be a problem. Companies are also expected to require all of their subcontractors to take precautions.",
      "Companies are also expected to set up hotlines where people can report any child labor concerns. And the Labor Department expects them to maintain accurate records of all their employees including their birth dates and work they do.",
      "And companies should discipline anyone who does hire children in violation of labor laws.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 15:57:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Scott Bessent, tapped by Donald Trump to be treasury secretary, faced sharp questions from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be treasury secretary, Scott Bessent fielded sharp questions Thursday at his confirmation hearing from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS tax filing system.",
      "Bessent told the Senate Finance Committee that the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress doesn't renew provisions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He also argued the Federal Reserve should remain independent from the president's influence and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil should be more aggressive.",
      "He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary \"who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.\" Graham added, \"Your ship came in with this guy.\"",
      "But Democrats, including Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion.",
      "Bennet accused Bessent of shedding \"crocodile tears\" over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. \"There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe\" from the tax cuts.",
      "Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, including Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also asked Bessent a series of questions about reducing national spending to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS' Direct File program \u2014 which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free \u2014 at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers call the program a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular.",
      "He also called for stronger sanctions on Russia, criticizing the Biden administration for a sanctions regime he said isn't \"muscular\" enough. \"I believe the previous administration was worried about raising U.S. energy prices during an election season,\" Bessent said.",
      "Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee, also mulling over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut.",
      "Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident.",
      "\"Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\" Bessent testified.",
      "Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight.",
      "In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. During the hearing, Bessent said he and his husband are up to date on their taxes, and he is in litigation over the portion of his taxes in controversy. He also committed to shuttering his firm if confirmed to be treasury secretary.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit.",

      "After a historic vote on Wednesday, women's teams will now receive \"performance units\" for every game they play in the NCAA Tournament. Met with a round of applause at the NCAA's convention in Nashville, Tennessee, the unanimous vote was the final buzzer-beater in establishing a pay structure for women competing in March Madness.",
      "The change comes as men's basketball teams have been a part of revenue-sharing plans for years. But with a surge in popularity surrounding women's basketball, the NCAA's Board of Governors voted unanimously for the proposal in August. Wednesday's vote solidified the details.",
      "Starting in the 2025 season, a combined $15 million will be awarded to the teams, which makes up 26% of the women's basketball media revenue deal. It will increase to $20 million for the 2026-27 fiscal year and reach $25 million starting with the 2027-28 fiscal year. The units earned will be paid out to the schools starting in 2026 on a rolling three-year basis.",
      "The longer a school stays in the tournament, the more units the school's conference receives. With a Final Four appearance, a team could bring its conference $1.26 million over the next three years. The revenue distribution plan for the women's tournament is similar to the men's.",
      "\"This is a historic day for women's sports, women's basketball and the NCAA,\" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"We have made investing in women's sports a priority, and today's vote means our members have the opportunity to do even more on campus to promote and support female athletes. I can't wait to see all the incredible things they do.\"",
      "Last year's women's national championship game drew in record attendance and also saw 18.7 million viewers tune in, becoming the most-watched women's college basketball game ever with an 89% increase from the 2023 championship game. It also outdrew the men's national championship game by 3 million viewers.",
      "Viewing records were set across all six rounds as fans watched outstanding players like Iowa's Caitlin Clark take on South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley and the undefeated Gamecocks. Other players who contributed to the boost in viewership were LSU's Angel Reese, USC's JuJu Watkins and UConn's Paige Bueckers.",
      "Bueckers, who is expected to be a top pick in the 2025 WNBA draft if she decides not to return to the Huskies for another year, said revenue sharing is a step in the right direction. \"I think that's huge, just for women's hoop, continuing to capitalize on what we've brought to the sport and what we do for just sport in general and entertainment,\" Bueckers told reporters.",
      "\"It's capitalizing on the momentum that's out there,\" UConn head coach Geno Auriemma said. \"It's a statement that they made today about where women's basketball fits into the big picture of college athletics.\"",

You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:59:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Insurance companies are canceling homeowner policies across the U.S. \u2014 even in regions that aren't considered climate hot spots.",
    "story": [
      "As disasters linked to climate change become more frequent in the U.S., homeowners across the country are paying the price through skyrocketing insurance costs \u2014 and not only in states like Florida and California that are considered most vulnerable to global warming.",
      "The Los Angeles wildfires, which have decimated neighborhoods such as Pacific Palisades and Altadena, are focusing attention on a mounting insurance crisis that is particularly acute in states at greatest risk of wildfires, such as California, Colorado, Texas and Oregon. But the problem is reaching into almost every region of the U.S., including the Midwest, the Northeast and the Mountain states, according to analyses of insurance data.",
      "Research shows that climate change is heightening the conditions that lead to fire-conducive weather, including drying out vegetation and constraining water supplies. Such conditions are in turn prolonging wildfire season as well magnifying the size and intensity of blazes.",
      "In 2024, there were 27 weather and climate disasters causing at least $1 billion in damages, ranging from hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to wildfires, drought and hail, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Between 2020 and 2024, the average annual cost of those events topped $149 billion \u2014 more than double the annual average cost of roughly $65 billion between 1980 and 2024.",
      "\"Serious pocketbook issue\"",
      "The average homeowners insurance premium jumped 33% from 2020 to 2023, rising from $1,902 per year to $2,530, according to 2024\u00a0research\u00a0from economists at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the University of Wisconsin. By comparison, inflation rose about 18% during that same time period.",
      "Such costs have surged even more in parts of the U.S. prone to the kind of natural disasters that experts link to climate change. Homeowners in these states have seen their insurance premiums soar by about 50% over that three-year period, according to Benjamin Keys, a professor real estate and finance at Wharton and a co-author of the 2024 study.",
      "Yet even property owners in states considered less vulnerable to climate disasters are now grappling with increased insurance costs and dropped policies \u2014 issues that threaten to undermine property values.",
      "\"We're seeing it now for five years in a row \u2014 the increases in insurance costs \u2014 and they are correlated with increased severity of climate events,\" Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, a non-profit research firm that models climate risks, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One thing that is surprising is that Kansas and Nebraska and these places in the middle of the country are also seeing these huge increases in insurance.\"",
      "While the average U.S. homeowners insurance cost is now about $2,300 per year, Nebraskans pay an average of $5,700, while Oklahomans are shelling out about $4,800 annually \u2014 not far from Florida's $5,500 average annual rate, Bankrate data shows.",
      "Insurers are responding to the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, hurricanes and flooding by hiking premiums to recoup their payouts, researchers have found. In 2000, homeowners' insurance costs represented about 7.5% of the typical mortgage; that figure had soared to 22% as of 2023, according to First Street's research.",
      "\"That is a serious pocketbook issue,\" said Wharton's Keys in a Jan. 10 webcast to discuss the Los Angeles wildfires and insurance, about the rise in policy premiums. \"That is the kind of thing that gets you around the kitchen table and say, do we need to move?\"",
      "Dropped policies from coast to coast",
      "In some cases, homeowners aren't only facing higher insurance costs, but also difficulties in even securing coverage.",
      "Non-renewal rates have climbed sharply in California and Florida, where the so-called insurer of last resort \u2014 the states' Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR, plans \u2014 has seen a jump in enrollment. Thousands of homeowners in Los Angeles were dropped by their insurers last year, just months before the wildfires hit.",
      "\"It's the fire hazard. It's a fire danger, you know? We were in an area that they couldn't provide insurance to any longer,\" Jeff Cohen, whose Altadena, California, home was burned in this month's fires, told CBS News about being dropped by his insurer prior to the disaster. He and his wife eventually found pricier coverage through the state's FAIR Plan.",
      "But it's not only homeowners in states like California, Florida and Louisiana who are getting dropped by their insurers, according to a Senate Budget Committee report published last month. While most of the top 10 states for non-renewals by insurers were either coastal states or those prone to wildfire, Oklahoma also ranked high, likely due to \"increasing winds and hail from severe convective storms,\" the report found.",
      "The next 15 states with rates of home coverage non-renewal include Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Ohio, as well as Mountain states including South Dakota and Montana, the analysis found. While non-renewal rates have more than tripled in Florida between 2018 to 203, Oklahoma isn't far behind, with the rate of dropped policies nearly doubling over that time, the data shows.",
      "\"With a more volatile atmosphere, there is more latent energy in the climate, and we end up with more intense thunderstorms that produce heavy precipitation,\" First Street's Porter noted. \"They are tied back to climate change, and the fact that the air temperatures are warmer and the sea is warmer, winds are impacted in a way that's more volatile.\"",
      "Heavy rains in Vermont that led to damaging\u00a0flooding in July 2024, as well as Hurricane Helene's devastation in parts of North Carolina last year, are illustrative of these more damaging weather events, Porter noted.",
      "\"Notably, the data make clear that insurance non-renewals are not only a problem for communities typically seen as being on the front lines of climate change,\" the Senate report said. \"Florida, California, and Louisiana have been seen as the canaries in the coal mine.\"",
      "The ressearchers added, \"[P]laces such as southern New England, parts of Montana, New Mexico, coastal and inland North Carolina, and South Carolina, among others, are not far behind.\"",
      "Property values at risk?",
      "Most Americans in the U.S. who own a home also have property insurance because such coverage is required by mortgage lenders, which mandate the policies to secure their investments against damage from theft or accidents like storms or falling trees.",
      "But as climate-related disasters proliferate, insurers are readjusting their risk models and boosting premiums to cover their need for increased capital reserves as well as to buy more reinsurance \u2014 basically, insurance provided to insurers by other carriers,\u00a0according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other weather events become more intense due to human-caused climate change, it's likely that insurance access and affordability will also worsen, the Senate report predicted. In some extreme examples, property values could plummet if those areas become uninsurable, an issue that's already hit some communities vulnerable to wildfires and other weather disasters.",
      "U.S. homeowners burdened by heavy insurance costs are unlikely to see any relief anytime soon, according to experts.",
      "\"We're in the middle of insurance price corrections \u2014 they will continue until insurance companies are able to be profitable,\" Porter said. \"Really no matter where you are across the country, there is some climate hazard that you are exposed to.\"",

      "Marketed for consumption by children ages 12 to 36 months, toddler milk is portrayed as the next step for little ones after they have outgrown infant formulas approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Yet unlike baby formula, the toddler milk products are not regulated by the FDA and are potentially harmful, according to\u00a0PHAI, a nonprofit legal research center located at Northeastern University School of Law.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:45:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The CFPB is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts.",
    "story": [
      "Capital One was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts. As a result, customers lost more than $2 billion in potential interest payments, the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \"360 Savings\" accounts, which were promoted as accounts providing one of the highest interest rates in the nation. But instead, the CFPB alleges, Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.",
      "At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \"360 Performance Savings,\" which had a much higher rate \u2014 at one point, more than 14 times higher than the original \"360 Savings\" accounts. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates, part of its effort to fight soaring inflation. As a result, some banks have rolled out high-interest savings accounts to attract savers.",
      "But at the same time, some banks haven't boosted rates on their savings accounts, creating a gap between low-and top-paying accounts, similar to that of Capital One's two offerings. According to the CFPB, Capital One marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\" those with 360 Savings accounts about the higher-paying 360 Performance Savings, the agency said.",
      "\"Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts,\" the CFPB said in a statement. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates to fight soaring inflation, which allowed banks to roll out high-interest savings accounts after years of meager rates.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \"vigorously defend\" itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \"deeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\"",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \"offer great rates\" \u2014 and have \"always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\"",
      "Billions in lost interest",
      "These actions mean Capital One \"illegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\" the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it's seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\"Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can't live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 \u2014 falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.",
      "The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive.",
      "Analyst commentary from TD Cowen on Tuesday noted that the CFPB still brought enforcement actions under Trump's first term, for example, although such litigation may also be easier to settle under the incoming administration.",

      "\"We deployed our teams to these high-risk properties we knew the fire was going to possibly reach, and we were on the ground before the fire even made it to that area,\" Torres said. That included fighting fires from homeowners' properties, using residents' resources like pools, spas, rainwater tanks and water tanks to extinguish flames, in addition to the company's own fire retardants. Torres noted that the company never relies on municipal resources, like fire hydrants, to serve private clients.",
      "He added that the company operates completely independently from Los Angeles County Fire Department, but that \"indirectly, we are helping each other.\"",
      "\"Our teams have been working alongside municipal firefighters in this event,\" he said.",
      "The National Wildfire Suppression Association (NWSA), which represents private firefighter services, said that contractors often join forces with local, state and federal firefighting efforts. Contracts with private home and land owners account for a small share of business for these types of companies; the bulk of contracts comes from providing supplemental personnel and equipment to local, state and federal firefighting efforts, according to the NWSA.",
      "Fire prevention and mitigation contractors also do work for insurance companies performing tasks to reduce fire risks, such as clearing undergrowth, trimming or removing trees near homes, and applying fire retardants. A growing segment of the industry, this work typically occurs during the off-season and not in response to active fires.",
      "An \"all hands on deck\" situation",
      "The association, which represents 369 private firefighting companies across the country, confirmed that its members have directed personnel and other resources toward containing the Los Angeles wildfires. Combined, its member organizations can pool up to 11,000 professionally trained wildland firefighters.",
      "\"The size and scale of these fires and the devastation left in their wake require an all-hands-on-deck approach to suppression, restoration and future prevention, including state, federal and private resources,\" the NWSA said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday declared the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy unlawful, casting a cloud of uncertainty over more than half a million unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as children ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.",
      "A panel of judges before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that found that a Biden administration rule to codify DACA violated U.S. immigration law. The 2012 Obama administration memo that originally created the policy has also been found to be unlawful by federal courts.",
      "Friday's ruling, however, will not immediately change the status quo. By suspending its order, the panel of judges kept DACA alive for current recipients and closed to new applicants, as the program has been operating for the past few years.",
      "For more than 12 years, DACA has allowed hundreds of thousands of immigrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas as minors to live and work in the U.S., without fear of deportation. They are colloquially known as \"Dreamers,\" a moniker stemming from the Dream Act, a bipartisan effort to legalize them that Congress has considered, but failed to pass, for over two decades.",
      "While it affirmed the lower court order that voided the Biden administration's DACA regulation, the 5th Circuit panel narrowed the ruling's impact, making it applicable only in Texas, the state spearheading the Republican-led lawsuit against the program. The panel paused its ruling as it relates to current DACA beneficiaries, pending another ruling by the 5th Circuit or the Supreme Court, allowing renewals to continue.",
      "The panel also ruled that the deportation deferrals offered by DACA could be legally separated from the work permits that beneficiaries receive, giving the Biden administration a partial victory on its argument that the deportation protections should be left intact if the work authorization provision is struck down.",
      "As of the end of September 2024, there were roughly 538,000 immigrants enrolled in DACA, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees the initiative. To qualify for the policy, applicants had to establish they arrived in the U.S. by their 16th birthday and before June 2007; graduated from an American high school or enrolled in the military; and lacked any serious criminal records.",
      "Friday's ruling could pave the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to finally settle the years-long legal battle over DACA. But it's unclear how the incoming Trump administration will handle the case and whether it will try to terminate the program. While President Biden's Justice Department has vigorously defended DACA in court, the first Trump administration tried phasing out the policy, arguing it was unlawful. The Supreme Court in 2020 prevented DACA's termination on technical grounds.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on Friday's court order.",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately say how the incoming administration would approach DACA.

      "Washington \u2014 The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. could be in for a rude awakening come Sunday if they suddenly find the enormously popular video-sharing app is inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.",
      "Lawmakers and U.S. officials have sounded the alarm for years about the supposed risks that TikTok's ties to China pose to national security, and Congress moved last year to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",

Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",

The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",

The justices reiterated the government's concerns that such information may allow China to track the locations of federal employees, craft dossiers of information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.",
      "The court's opinion also cited Congress' finding that under Chinese law, companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" it said.",
      "The court went on to say that the law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, is \"sufficiently tailored to address the government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary from collecting vast swaths of sensitive data about the 170 million U.S. persons who use TikTok.\"",
      "Its provisions \"clearly serve the government's data collection interest,\" the court said, and are not broader than needed to address concerns about China's access to Americans' personal information.",
      "The court noted the government's interest in preventing China from having control over TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and its ability to covertly alter the content appearing on the app for users in the U.S. But it said the record in the case \"adequately supports the conclusion that Congress would have passed the challenged provisions based on the data collection justification alone.\"",
      "According to Congress and the Biden administration, the court said, ByteDance uses data collected from TikTok to train the app's recommendation algorithm and would not agree to stop collecting U.S. users' data or sending it to China. The government also noted the challenges with monitoring data-sharing between TikTok and its parent company.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, we find the government's data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions,\" the court said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch issued a separate opinion agreeing with the outcome of the case, but splitting with the court's legal reasoning. He wrote that the court was right to refrain from endorsing the government's goal of preventing the purported covert manipulation of content by China.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" he wrote. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "Gorsuch concluded his opinion by noting that \"speaking with and in favor of a foreign adversary is one thing. Allowing a foreign adversary to spy on Americans is another.\"",
      "The law at issue in the case requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had\u00a0urged the court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office, but said following the ruling that he \"must have time to review the situation.\"",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a new law that would lead to a ban of the social media platform TikTok, clearing the way for the widely popular app to shutter in the U.S. as soon as Sunday.",
      "\"We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate the petitioners' First Amendment rights,\" the court said in a unanimous unsigned opinion, which upholds the lower court decision against TikTok. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch wrote separately, with Gorsuch agreeing with the outcome of the case but splitting with the court's reasoning.",
      "What happens to TikTok when the Sunday deadline arrives is still unclear. Following the ruling, the White House said the Biden administration would not enforce the ban on Sunday, and would leave it to the Trump administration. President-elect Donald Trump wrote in a social media post that he would make his \"decision on TikTok\" in \"the not too distant future,\" but that he \"must have time to review the situation.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that \"the statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "The court's ruling comes days before the law, which was passed with bipartisan majorities of Congress last April, is set to take effect. TikTok and a group of content creators who use the app argued the law infringes on their free speech rights, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in their bid to block it one week ago.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "\"The challenged provisions further an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression and do not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further that interest,\" the court said, adding that the law's requirements that TikTok either divest or face a ban are designed to prevent China from gaining access to the personal data from the app's U.S. users.",
      "Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the law requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance, its parent company, or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had urged the court to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office.",
      "In response to the ruling, Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that it was \"expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\"",
      "With the Supreme Court declining to throw TikTok a lifeline, the immediate effects on access to the app as of Sunday's deadline aren't clear. Reuters reported Wednesday that the company planned to shut down for U.S. users once the ban takes effect. Those trying to open the app would be greeted with a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the new law, according to the report.",
      "Many users have begun downloading their videos and data from TikTok in anticipation of a ban and migrating to other platforms, including the Chinese-owned RedNote.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "Trump could decline to enforce the ban, but companies like Apple and Google could still potentially face steep fines if they host the app in violation of the law. During arguments last week, the government noted there is a five-year statute of limitations for violations of the law, meaning a future administration could punish offenders.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in a video that the company \"will do everything in its power to ensure our platform thrives\" for users. He also explicitly thanked Trump for \"his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"",
      "\"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\" Chew said.",
      "TikTok and the Supreme Court",
      "Congress and the Biden administration have raised national security concerns about TikTok for years. Federal employees cannot have the app on their government-issued phones, and a majority of states have barred the platform on state government devices.",
      "The law aims to prevent China from collecting substantial amounts of data from the platform's 170 million U.S. users and covertly manipulate the content on TikTok to harm the U.S. by sowing discord and division, federal officials have said.",
      "But TikTok, which curates short videos for users through a powerful recommendation algorithm, said it is a U.S. company that is protected by the First Amendment from Congress' attempt to ban the platform.",
      "During arguments, the justices appeared poised to uphold the law, though several expressed concerns that it could conflict with the First Amendment. Still, many of the court's members seemed to agree that the law targeted TikTok's ownership by a foreign company, ByteDance, instead of the speech shared on the platform.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the U.S. government, said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the Supreme Court's decision would be \"enormously consequential.\" If the companies are forced to cut ties, he said, TikTok \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. Other social media platforms have tried to replicate the algorithm, but have been unable to match TikTok's, according to Jeffrey Fisher, who represented the creators. China has said it is opposed to the sale of TikTok's algorithm.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Jan. 19, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores. If TikTok doesn't shut down voluntarily, experts told CBS News that the experience for users who already have it on their phones would likely suffer with time because they would no longer receive software updates.",
      "Several of the justices on the liberal and conservative wings of the bench repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's collection of data from its American users and the Chinese government's access to that personal information.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Francisco, referring to ByteDance.",
      "Congress found that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work and ensure it has the power to access private data the company holds, Roberts said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, warned of the future implications of the Chinese government having access to data from the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every month.",
      "Congress and the president, he said, were worried that China \"would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or the State Department. Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Francisco claimed that TikTok would \"have to go mute\" unless it severs ties from ByteDance, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back on that characterization of the law.",
      "\"If TikTok were to, post-divestiture or whatever, pre-divestiture, come up with its own algorithm, then when the divestiture happened, it could still operate. It doesn't say, 'TikTok, you can't speak,'\" she said, adding that TikTok can remain in the U.S. as long as it's not associated with ByteDance.",
      "In its opinion, the high court focused primarily on the data collection concerns raised by Congress and the Justice Department, finding that the law is sufficiently tailored to address the U.S. government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary, China, from collecting \"vast swaths\" of sensitive information from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "For Americans who rely on TikTok to exchange ideas about all manner of topics, from politics to entertainment to the news, the stakes of the case are high. Creators who challenged the law said they use it to sell products, reach thousands of people and create a nationwide community.",
      "\"That's our editor and publisher of choice that we think best disseminates our speech,\" Fisher said.",
      "Trump attempted to effectively ban TikTok during his first term in office because of national security concerns, though his executive order targeting the app was blocked by a federal court and then rescinded by Mr. Biden. But the president-elect has reversed course on his view of the platform.",
      "Trump told Newsmax in an interview this week that he's \"not opposed\" to TikTok and said his campaign's use of the app helped him win over young voters in the November presidential election.",

    "story": [
      "Driven by \"curiosity,\" a U.S. Navy corpsman attempted to access President Biden's medical records last year following a group discussion with his colleagues about military security protocols for using government computers, according to the federal criminal investigation obtained by CBS News.",
      "In July, CBS News reported a junior U.S. Navy sailor attempted to gain access to Mr. Biden's medical records but was unable to do so and was subsequently administratively reprimanded for the unauthorized query.",
      "CBS News filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the civilian law enforcement agency responsible for criminal investigations within the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. On Friday, NCIS released its closed investigation to CBS News.",
      "The investigation details how a low-ranking U.S. Navy corpsman attempted to access the president's medical records and the penalty he received for doing so \u2014 a nonjudicial punishment for dereliction of duty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the laws and regulations governing the U.S. military.",
      "The corpsman, whose name the Navy will not disclose, was demoted in rank to E-2 from E-3, given 20 days of extra duty and only received half pay for the next six months. Base pay for an E-2 with two to three years of service is roughly $2,260 per month.",
      "On the afternoon of Feb. 22, according to the NCIS documents, the Navy corpsman sat at his desk, surrounded by the steady hum of computers and the murmurs of his coworkers at the Naval Medical Readiness and Training Center at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. A civilian described as a licensed nurse and a U.S. Army soldier worked nearby.",
      "The scene was standard bureaucratic fare until a nearby colleague left her workstation, leaving her Common Access Card, or CAC, behind \u2014 which was still logged into her account. This small, unassuming piece of plastic, roughly the size of a credit card, is described by the Defense Department as a \"smart\" key, granting access to everything from locked doors to military computer networks.",
      "The group of medical professionals struck up a conversation and started talking about the security risk of leaving a CAC unattended in a computer.",
      "One of the unnamed individuals pointed out the glaring vulnerability: \"Someone could maliciously use your CAC when you walk away,\" they said, according to the narrative of the group discussion within the NCIS investigation.",
      "Another voice in the group floated the idea that someone could use an unattended CAC account to snoop on the president's medical records. The notion hung in the air. The Navy corpsman responded with apparent disbelief \u2014 could he actually pull up the medical records for the president of the United States? He decided to test it, according to the NCIS investigation.",
      "The Navy corpsman told NCIS investigators he was driven by curiosity, so he pulled up the patient search database in the Genesis Medical Health System \u2014 the database for the military medical system \u2014 and typed in the name \"Joseph Biden.\"",
      "A single record with the name \"Joseph Biden\" appeared, with a birthdate attached. The NCIS investigation stated that when the file popped up, the Navy corpsman and his coworkers were \"freaked out,\" with one of his colleagues walking away from the computer.",
      "The Navy corpsman then turned to Google to look up Mr. Biden's birthdate, and saw that it matched the birthdate on the medical file. He clicked into the record to see what information was inside.",
      "The corpsman would later tell NCIS investigators that \"there was not a lot of information in the record, except two instances,\" and \"[he] did not remember the specifics of the instances, but remembered a doctor's name was listed.\" The corpsman turned to Google again and searched for the name of Mr. Biden's doctor, which did not match the name listed on the Genesis record, according to the investigation.",
      "The corpsman told NCIS agents that he realized at this point he should stop looking at the record and closed out the file. A forensic analysis showed that the \"Joseph Biden\" file was accessed for about 20 seconds, between 1:22 p.m. and 1:23 p.m.",
      "A female colleague, who was aware the corpsman searched the system for the president, advised him to report himself to his supervisor. The corpsman stated he knew he was going to be reported for violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the federal law designed to protect patients' health information.",
      "He didn't immediately report himself, but told investigators he felt guilty so he reported himself the next morning. By then, however, another colleague had already reported the violation up the chain of command. The corpsman waived his rights and confessed to accessing the record out of curiosity.",
      "The corpsman said he did not \"print, save, email, download, photograph, or otherwise document the record.\" Another colleague told investigators they had never heard the corpsman express \"anything about his political beliefs or background,\" and that he was \"nonchalant\" until the file popped up, describing him as \"freaked out.\"",
      "The Naval Criminal Investigative Service launched its investigation on Feb. 26. On Feb. 27, the deputy director of the White House medical unit \u2014 identified as a U.S. Army officer in the NCIS report \u2014 told investigators that the record accessed by the corpsman was not a legitimate electronic health record of the president.",
      "The president was informed about the sailor's attempts to access his medical records within hours of White House staff being notified about the attempted breach by the Defense Department, a White House official told CBS News in July.",
      "The president underwent his annual physical at Walter Reed on Feb. 28, two days after the Navy's criminal investigation began. The president was deemed \"fit for duty\" by his doctor after the physical that lasted about two and a half hours.",
      "NCIS agents also looked through the corpsman's social media accounts. Agents found that his profile picture on Instagram, when run though a reverse image search, \"revealed imagery potentially associated with the online 'hactivist' group Anonymous.\" It's not clear from the investigation if any actual link was confirmed by NCIS agents between the corpsman and Anonymous.",
      "The corpsman's MSI laptop and Apple iPhone were seized by NCIS investigators, with the corpsman cooperating fully. The laptop's internet browser history showed that the sailor conducted searches for \"Biden, Doctor, Flights, Anonymous, President, POTUS.\" A text message shows the corpsman telling an unnamed person that he \"looked up Joe Biden.\" The laptop and phone were later returned.",

The arena will also host the presidential parade. The space can fit about 20,000 people, a fraction of those who are expected to visit Washington for the inauguration.",
      "Dignitaries and other VIP guests will be brought into the Rotunda, Trump said, but space will be extremely limited.",
      "\"This will be a very beautiful experience for all, and especially for the large TV audience!\" Trump wrote in his post.",

      "A senior inaugural official in Washington previously told CBS News that moving the ceremony indoors was \"the president-elect's call.\" Two law enforcement sources told CBS News earlier that a \"Rotunda plan\" for the swearing-in was \"under consideration\" and had been a contingency for months.

      "The Biden administration's notice, filed Friday with the federal district court in San Francisco, comes just days ahead of a Jan. 21 deadline for the appeal.",
      "While last year's ruling did not order the Environmental Protection Agency to ban water fluoridation, opponents say it carved out a \"clear legal pathway\" giving the federal government authority to force local governments to stop adding the chemical to the water supply.",
      "Public health experts have long defended fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. The American Dental Association said last year that research shows it is a \"safe, beneficial and cost-effective public health measure\" for preventing cavities.",
      "District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled last year that evidence showed fluoride was \"hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" but stopped short of ordering the EPA to ban the practice.",
      "The judge said he only had the authority under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, to direct the EPA to take action against the risk, but not to prescribe the specifics of its response, which could range from a national warning to an outright ban.",

      "While those concerning levels are higher than what is typically added to the U.S. water supply, some opponents worry that the varied ways children consume drinks and food made with fluoridated water could add up to exposure that is too high for many kids.",

      "Not all local governments have stuck with their decision to stop fluoridating water. In Canada, Calgary's city council decided to reintroduce fluoride after cavity rates worsened in children.",
      "\"I hope this is sufficiently convincing to the leadership in the city of Calgary, Alberta, that they see the harm that stopping fluoridation has happened to the children of their city,\" said University of California San Francisco Professor Howard Pollick, in a post by the American Dental Association in 2021, after a study on higher cavity rates in the city.",

    "title": "As Biden exits, how will he be remembered for his handling of the U.S. economy?",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 17:25:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy rebounded strongly from the COVID shock, but the U.S. continues to grapple with a cost-of-living crisis and spiraling federal debt.",
    "story": [
      "As President Biden prepares to depart the White House, he leaves an economic legacy marked by a historic pandemic that paralyzed consumers and businesses across the U.S.",
      "After inheriting a COVID-scarred nation in 2021, Mr. Biden focused on righting the economy, a strategy that economists told CBS MoneyWatch is visible in the country's solid GDP growth and low unemployment. By several key measures, the economy is stronger than it was four years ago: The jobless rate is near a 50-year low, wages are growing and the U.S. managed to sidestep a recession widely expected by many on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve moved to curb inflation by ratcheting up interest rates.",
      "\"He should have a strong legacy when it comes to the economy,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said of Mr. Biden. \"He inherited an economy that was flat on its back because of the COVID pandemic, and he's leaving an economy that's flying high, at least in the aggregate,\"",
      "Zandi added, \"How much he can take credit for that, it's a reasonable debate, but I think he deserves a lot of credit.\"",
      "Zandi pointed to several pieces of landmark legislation passed under Biden, including the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, as helping to stabilize the nation and produce growth that has surpassed most other major economies around the world.",
      "Biden also score some wins on health care, such as a new $2,000 out-of-pocket\u00a0spending cap on prescriptions for Medicare enrollees and a $35 cap on insulin prices.",
      "Yet in retrospect, he added, additional trillions in federal stimulus may have played a part in the soaring inflation of the last few years, which Zandi said was also fueled by the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "ARPA \"was very controversial, but at the end of the day it got the economy back to full employment,\" Zandi said.",
      "Deep structural problems",
      "Although Biden's policies were key in helping the economy recover from the pandemic, millions of Americans continue to struggle with a cost-of-living crisis worsened by the hottest inflation in four decades. Long-term challenges in housing affordability only deepened during the Biden administration, while U.S. wealth inequality today remains near record levels.",
      "To be sure, health care, child care and education costs have outpaced inflation\u00a0for years, weighing on millions households and making many families vulnerable to even minor downturns. But the inflation spike in 2022 intensified these existing financial pains, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank.",
      "\"The American economy for a long time has been characterized by a lack of affordability for the biggest ticket items,\" Owens said. \"Housing has been out of reach, health care has been expensive, child care is expensive \u2014 that was all true before Biden.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Biden plan to sweep away student loan debt was largely\u00a0shot down by the courts, although the Department of Education used other means to offer relief to millions of borrowers. Housing costs continued to soar under Biden due to rising home values as well as soaring mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to battle inflation.",
      "The upshot: Under Biden, many households remained dogged by the same long-term pocketbook issues that have prevailed for decades under previous presidential administrations. During the pandemic, the soaring cost of essentials like food, fuel and rent only deepened the country's widespread precarity \u2014 a gnawing sense of financial insecurity that has left tens of millions of Americans vulnerable to job losses, medical problems and even modest economic dips.",
      "Ballooning debt",
      "Biden's legislative wins \u2014 ARPA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act in 2022 \u2014 added trillions in additional federal spending. The idea underlying these efforts was to rejuvenate the U.S. economy by investing in key sectors, such as by building semiconductor chip plants, rebuilding U.S. roads or accelerating the shift toward green energy.",
      "But those efforts will likely take years to pay off, economists note. In the meantime, the nation's debt has ballooned to a record $36.2 trillion as of mid-January due to a combination of fiscal stimulus authorized by both Biden and Trump, as well as Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "With federal spending outpacing revenues, the nation will face tough choices, such as whether to raise taxes, cut federal programs or both. Asked to describe Biden's economic legacy, Cato Institute vice president of general economics Scott Lincicome summarized it in one word: \"Frustrating.\"",
      "\"If you could look at the basic fundamentals \u2014 economic growth, jobs \u2014 things have been pretty good,\" Lincicome, who describes himself as a \"libertarian free marketer,\" added. \"But if you look beneath the hood, there are some rather significant problems.\"",
      "Chief among them are the nation's spiraling debt, Lincicome said. Treasury yields have been rising ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, partly due to concerns that the U.S. could struggle in coming years to service its debt.",
      "\"In terms of what Trump inherits \u2014 and it's not just Biden's fault, Trump did a lot of COVID spending, too \u2014 but we're now at a point where you can see bond markets are chirping, and you can see inflation has remained stubbornly higher than we would have hoped,\" Lincicome noted. \"The [Congressional Budget Office] and a lot of other folks agree that the debt is a pretty pressing issue.\"",
      "Trump's economy on Jan. 20",
      "Despite such concerns, the economists interviewed by CBS MoneyWatch say that Trump will inherit a strong economy when he's inaugurated. The nation's unemployment rate is 4.1%, down from 6.4% when Biden took office in January of 2021. In another plus for workers, average hourly earnings through December rose\u00a03.9%, keeping pay growth\u00a0ahead of consumer prices, which are up 2.9% over the last year.",
      "Not surprising, then, that Zandi and Lincicome had the same advice for the Trump administration in how it handles the U.S. economy: \"Do no harm.\"",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is do nothing,\" Zandi said. \"Biden got a basket case economy and he's bequeathing an economy that is operating at full tilt.\"",
      "For his part, Trump has signaled his intent to reshape the economy through a combination of steeper tariffs, deeper tax cuts, fewer federal regulations and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"Joe Biden's legacy is marred by crippling inflation, a migrant crime invasion and American weakness on the world stage,\" Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Thankfully, in just five days, President Trump will usher in a new Golden Age of American success and carry out his mandate to make America wealthy, safe, strong and great again.\"",
      "Economists view some of Trump's stated plans as potentially inflationary, although some question whether the president-elect will follow through with all of them, such as a broad-based tariff on all imports.",
      "\"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a December research note.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration wants to extend his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), an effort the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected could add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Trump has vowed that his tariffs would raise enough money to cover the tax cuts, a proposition that economists assess as unlikely.",
      "Tariffs could raise \"a few hundred billion, maybe, but that's total, and you're still in a massive hole,\" Lincicome noted.",
      "American oligarchs",
      "Extending the tax cuts would also likely favor the nation's wealthiest households, given that the TCJA cut taxes for top earners far more than for low- or middle-income Americans. During the past four years, America's richest people have seen their wealth soar, with Elon Musk \u2014 the world's richest person and a close adviser and backer of Trump \u2014 now worth $450 billion, more than double his $175 billion net worth when Biden was inaugurated in 2021, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his farewell message on Wednesday, Biden warned that the growing concentration of wealth in the U.S. poses a serious risk to the nation.",
      "\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.",
      "That's unlikely to change under Trump, economists predicted \"The big story of American inequality is a simple one: It's the takeoff in top incomes,\" Owens noted.",
      "She believes that \"Until we tax the top, we will have runaway income inequality.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 16:33:40 -0500",
    "summary": "The case involves whether parents' religious rights were violated when a Maryland school district declined to allow them to opt their children out of gender and sexuality instruction.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to take up a dispute over whether a Maryland school district violated parents' religious rights when it declined to allow them to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving storybooks about gender and sexuality.",
      "The dispute centers around a decision by the Montgomery County School Board to end opt-out requests and notice requirements for the reading and discussion of storybooks that feature LGBTQ characters. The case sets up another clash involving LGBTQ rights and religious rights. It's unclear whether the Supreme Court will hear arguments in its current term, which ends this summer, or its next term that will begin in October.",
      "The books were approved for the Montgomery County Public Schools language-arts curriculum for the 2022-2023 school year as part of an effort to include new material that better represents the school district's students and families, it said. Montgomery County is Maryland's largest county and its school system serves more than 160,000 students.",
      "Books introduced for students include titles like \"Pride Puppy,\" a picture book about a dog that gets lost at a Pride parade, and \"Jacob's Room to Choose,\" about two transgender school-aged children.",
      "Lawyers for the school district said in court filings that the books \"impart critical reading skills through engaging, age-appropriate stories,\" and the district follows a \"careful, public, participatory selection process\" to ensure they meet that criteria. The books are made available for individual reading, classroom read-alouds and other educational activities, according to the school district.",
      "After the books were introduced, some parents sought to have their children excused when they were read or discussed. Some of these so-called out-out requests were religious-based and others were not, according to court filings. Lawyers for the board said that while teachers and principals attempted to accommodate the requests, the number grew and raised concerns about student absenteeism, the feasibility of administering opt-outs throughout the district and the \"risk of exposing students who believe the storybooks represent them and their families to social stigma and isolation.\"",
      "The district then announced in March 2023 that it wouldn't allow opt-outs from language-arts instruction that involved the storybooks \"for any reason.\"",
      "The decision sparked backlash from the community, and more than 1,000 parents signed a petition urging the board to reinstate their notice and opt-out requests. Hundreds also attended school board meetings and said they had religious obligations not to subject their children to gender and sexuality instruction that conflicted with their religious beliefs.",
      "Following the school district's announcement, in May 2023, three sets of parents sued the Montgomery County Board of Education, alleging their First Amendment and due process rights were violated. The lead challengers are Tamer Mahmoud and Enas Barakat, who are Muslim and have a son in elementary school. Also challenging the board's move are Chris and Melissa Persak, who are Roman Catholic and have two elementary-age children, and Jeff and Svitlana Roman, who are Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox and have a son in elementary school.",
      "They sought a court order that would require notice and opt outs when the books were read or discussed. The parents argued their children's exposure to the books \"necessarily establishes the existence of a burden\" on their right to freely exercise their religion.",
      "A federal district court denied the request, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the decision.",
      "The divided three-judge panel found that there was no evidence at that time that the families were compelled to change their religious beliefs or conduct, or what they taught their children.",
      "The parents then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the 4th Circuit's decision effectively requires parents to \"surrender their right to direct the religious upbringing of their children by sending them to public schools.\"",
      "\"Under the Fourth Circuit's reasoning, parents cannot be heard until after the damage has been done to their children. But there is no unringing that bell \u2014 by then, innocence will be lost and beliefs undermined,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "But the school board urged the Supreme Court to turn away the case.",
      "They said the parents \"seek to unsettle a decades-old consensus that parents who choose to send their children to public school are not deprived of their right to freely exercise their religion simply because their children are exposed to curricular materials the parents find offensive.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Biden announced Friday that he was commuting the sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses, using his final days in office on a flurry of clemency actions meant to nullify prison terms he deemed too harsh.",
      "The recent round of clemency gives Mr. Biden the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued. The Democrat said he's seeking to undo \"disproportionately long sentences compared to the sentences they would receive today under current law, policy, and practice.\"",
      "\"Today's clemency action provides relief for individuals who received lengthy sentences based on discredited distinctions between crack and powder cocaine, as well as outdated sentencing enhancements for drug crimes,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"This action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities, and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately release the names of those receiving commutations.",
      "Still, Mr. Biden said more could yet be coming, promising to use the time before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated Monday to \"continue to review additional commutations and pardons.\"",
      "Friday's action follows Mr. Biden's commutations last month of the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the pardoning of 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. That was the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.",
      "All of this comes as Mr. Biden continues to weigh whether to issue sweeping pardons for officials and allies who the White House fears could be unjustly targeted by Trump's administration. Though presidential pardoning powers are absolute, such a preemptive move would be a novel and risky use of the president's extraordinary constitutional power.",
      "Last month, he also commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment just weeks before Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment, takes office. Trump has vowed to roll back that order after his term begins.",
      "Mr. Biden also recently pardoned his son Hunter, not just for his convictions on federal gun and tax violations but for any potential federal offense committed over an 11-year period, as the president feared Trump allies would seek to prosecute his son for other offenses.",

    "summary": "Kristi Noem\u200b, Trump's pick to lead the sprawling Department of Homeland Security, took questions from lawmakers on border policies and disaster relief.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the sprawling Department of Homeland Security, fielded questions on an array of topics, including the border, homegrown terrorism and the distribution of disaster relief from lawmakers Friday at her Senate confirmation hearing.",
      "She appeared before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, which has jurisdiction over the DHS and those nominated to lead the department.",
      "\"As we face the evolving threats of the 21st century, the mission and the success of DHS is more critical than ever. We must be vigilant and proactive and innovative to protect the homeland,\" she said in her opening statement. \"The challenges in front of us are extremely significant, and we must secure our borders against illegal trafficking and immigration.\"",
      "Noem, a former Republican member of Congress who has been South Dakota's governor since 2019, was asked about the incoming Trump administration's sweeping immigration plans.",
      "During the hearing, GOP senators asked Noem about an app introduced by the Biden administration, called\u00a0CBP One, to allow migrants to set up an appointment at international bridges, where U.S. officials determine whether they should be allowed into the country to request asylum. It's been used millions of times to help process claims more quickly. Many Republicans oppose its use and asked about Noem's plans for the app.",
      "\"Will you use your authority to stop facilitating faster processing of illegal aliens into our country with the CBP One app?\" GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma asked.",
      "\"Yes, senator,\" Noem responded. \"We will eliminate the CBP One app \u2014 maintain some of the data that's in it that's critical to knowing who's in our country \u2014 but that app will no longer be in use.\"",
      "DHS oversees airport security, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other responsibilities. The question of FEMA funding came up early in the hearing when Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut raised the California wildfires. He expressed dismay about Trump's comments about the fires \u2014 and the state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. He noted the president-elect said recently, \"We won't give him, referring to Gov. Newsom, money to put out fires, and if we don't give him money, he's got a problem,\" and asked Noem if she would say \"no\" to Trump if he tried to withhold aid to California or any other state for political reasons.",
      "While Noem did not address the question about Trump, she assured Blumenthal, \"Under my leadership of the Department of Homeland Security, there will be no political bias to how disaster relief is delivered to the American people.\"",
      "\"I will deliver the programs according to the law, and it will be done with no political bias,\" she said.",
      "The department also houses the three main federal immigration agencies that will play a key role in implementing Trump's immigration agenda: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, asked Noem about homegrown terror threats and the Americans who \"have been radicalized by a variety of ideologies of white supremacy to ISIS to al Qaeda.\"",
      "Noem said the \"No. 1 threat to our homeland security is our southern border,\" stating that during President Biden's administration, \"we've seen 382 individuals that have come over that border that are on the terrorist watch list.\" But she conceded that \"also, we need to focus on domestic terrorism\" and noted \"homegrown terrorism is on the rise.\"",
      "DHS, she said, has to both identify the threats posed by U.S. citizens leaving the country and returning radicalized and be \"proactive,\" while \"also protecting civil rights and liberties in that process.\"",
      "When announcing her nomination as DHS secretary soon after the election, Trump noted that Noem dispatched the South Dakota National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border to help Texas state officials fortify it amid record levels of migrant crossings.",
      "If confirmed as DHS secretary, Noem would likely play an important role in shaping the second Trump administration's planned changes to U.S. immigration and border policy, alongside incoming border czar Tom Homan and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Republicans control a majority in the Senate, making her confirmation likely.",
      "Among other promises, Trump and his advisers have vowed to reverse Biden administration immigration programs, enact harsher rules at the U.S.-Mexico border, scale back refugee admissions and dramatically ramp deportations of immigrants living in the country illegally. The president-elect has also pledged to upend the longstanding principle of birthright citizenship, in a bid to prevent children born to unauthorized immigrants from becoming American citizens at birth.",
      "Considered a Trump loyalist, Noem has been praised by conservatives for her record as governor, which includes vocally opposing mask mandates and other COVID-era measures. But she's also garnered detractors. Tribal nations in South Dakota, for example, have banned her from their lands over comments she's made alleging cartel activity in tribal territory.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge in Texas is allowing three other states to pursue a challenge seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "A judge in Texas ruled Thursday that three other states can move ahead with their effort to roll back federal rules and make it harder for people across the U.S. to access the abortion drug mifepristone.",
      "The states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri made the request in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas. The only judge based there is Matthew Kacsmaryk, a nominee of former President Donald Trump who previously ruled in favor of a challenge to the pill's approval.",
      "The states want the federal Food and Drug Administration to prohibit telehealth prescriptions for mifepristone and require that it be used only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy instead of the current limit of 10 weeks. They also want to require three in-person doctor office visits instead of none to get the drug.",
      "That's because, the states argue, efforts to provide access to the pills \"undermine state abortion laws and frustrate state law enforcement,\" according to court documents.",
      "Meanwhile, Kacsmaryk said they shouldn't be automatically discounted from suing in Texas just because they're outside the state.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday that the case should have been settled when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously preserved access to mifepristone last year, where the justices issued a narrow ruling finding that abortion opponents who first filed the case lacked the legal right to sue.",
      "Kacsmaryk's decision \"has left the door open for extremist politicians to continue attacking medication abortion in his courtroom,\" the ACLU said.",
      "The ruling comes days before Trump begins his second term as president, so his administration will likely be representing the FDA in the case. Trump has repeatedly said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government, though he's also stressed on the campaign trail that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion in 2022.",
      "In the years since, abortion opponents have increasingly targeted abortion pills, largely due to most U.S. abortions being carried out using drugs rather than through surgical procedures. So far, at least four states \u2014 Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have seen Republicans introduce bills aimed at banning pills. None take the same approach as Louisiana, which last year classified the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.",
      "Previously, Kacsmaryk sided with a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations that wanted the FDA to be forced to rescind entirely its approval of mifepristone in 2000.",
      "Yet the states are pursuing a narrower challenge. Rather than target the approval entirely, they sought to undo a series of FDA updates that have eased access.",
      "But while the states' leaders are pushing to severely limit access to the drugs, voters in Missouri sent a different message in November when they approved a ballot measure to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. In Idaho, abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy. In Kansas, abortion is generally legal up until the 22nd week of pregnancy.",
      "Across the U.S., 13 states under Republican legislative control bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four more ban it after the first six weeks \u2014 before women often know they're pregnant.",
      "Some Democratic-controlled states have adopted laws seeking to shield from investigations and prosecutions the doctors who prescribe the pills via telehealth appointments and mail them to patients in states with bans. Those prescriptions are a major reason a study found that residents of states with bans are getting abortions in about the same numbers as they were before the bans were in place.",
      "Mifepristone is usually used in combination with a second drug for medication abortion, which has accounted for more than three-fifths of all abortions in the U.S. since the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "The drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they're pregnant. Studies have found they're generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.",

      "The incoming Trump administration is planning to install Texas' border czar as head of U.S. Border Patrol, replacing the career official who currently leads the agency in charge of stopping the illicit movement of migrants and drugs.",
      "Mike Banks, who has spearheaded Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's border crackdown, is expected to be appointed Border Patrol chief after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office, two sources familiar with the move told CBS News Thursday.",
      "Banks would replace current Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens, a 28-year veteran career official at the agency. Owens is set to retire from government service in April, two U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "In an internal message sent to agents Thursday and obtained by CBS News, Owens said the opportunity to serve as Border Patrol chief was \"the highest honor I have ever received.\"",
      "\"Looking ahead, I will leave with a profound sense of optimism about its future and that of our country,\" Owens wrote. \"I will take comfort knowing that you are on our frontline, standing between the innocent and the evil.\"",
      "Banks' appointment would be a departure from the general practice of Border Patrol having leaders that are career government officials, not political appointees.",
      "A former U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, Banks has been a key player in Texas' aggressive effort to counter what the state has argued is the Biden administration's failure to secure the southern border amid record levels of migrant crossings.",
      "Since March 2021, Texas has bussed tens of thousands of migrants to major Democratic-led U.S. cities, deployed the National Guard to fortify the banks of the Rio Grande with razor wire and assigned troopers to arrest migrants on criminal trespassing charges.",
      "It also tried to enact its own immigration law to arrest and jail migrants suspected of entering the country illegally, though that measure is currently held up in court.",
      "As Border Patrol chief, Banks would oversee the agents in green uniforms responsible for apprehending migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally between official entry points, or those who reach Florida and other coastal sectors by sea. Over the past years, discontent among rank-and-file agents has grown over disagreements with the Biden administration's immigration policies.",
      "One U.S. official said Banks is expected to join the second Trump administration in some capacity soon after Trump is inaugurated, alongside Rodney Scott, who the president-elect has tapped to be his CBP commissioner.",
      "Scott was a Border Patrol chief himself, appointed under the first Trump administration, until he was ousted by the Biden administration in the spring of 2021. As CBP commissioner, Scott would oversee Border Patrol, but also customs and immigration officials at airports, sea ports and land crossings. That position requires Senate confirmation.",
      "Beyond Banks and Scott, the incoming Trump administration also plans to install Tom Homan, a longtime Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, as its border czar, a new White House position. Homan is expected to play a key role in carrying out what Trump has promised will be the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "During the first three years of the Biden administration, CBP reported record levels of migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border, and officials struggled at times to contain mass illegal crossings. But unlawful border crossings have since plunged to a four-year low due to asylum limits President Biden enacted in June, and Mexico's efforts to stop migrants from trekking north.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Thursday that it may announce opinions on Friday morning, a last-minute addition to the schedule that comes just two days before a law that would ban TikTok is set to go into effect.",
      "\"The Court may announce opinions on the homepage beginning at 10 a.m.,\" a notice on the\u00a0court's website said, without specifying what case or cases might be decided. \"The Court will not take the Bench.\"",
      "The law would cut TikTok off from U.S. app stores and hosting services if it does not cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, before the Jan. 19 deadline.",
      "The Supreme Court seemed likely to upload the law when it heard arguments over TikTok's legal challenge last week, with the justices seeming sympathetic to the government's claims that China could use TikTok to collect a vast amount of data on its American users and spy on them.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the potential Supreme Court decision is \"enormously consequential\" for the platform's 170 million users in the U.S. and their free speech rights.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Sunday, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said last week. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "In April, Congress swiftly passed the bipartisan legislation, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as part of a foreign aid package, and it was signed into law by President Biden. It gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance, with the possibility of a 90-day extension if a sale were in progress by the January deadline. Absent a sale, TikTok loses access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S.",
      "The law would take effect one day before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. Trump, who attempted to prohibit the app during his first term over national security concerns, has since said he wants to \"save\" the app and has credited it with helping him win over more youth voters.",
      "\"We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,\" Trump's incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" on Thursday. \"It's been a great platform for him and his campaign.\"",
      "Some lawmakers are also pushing for a delay in the law's implementation. Two Democratic senators said Thursday they sent a letter to Mr. Biden urging him to trigger a provision in the measure to delay it for another 90 days, despite no apparent sale being in progress.",
      "\"It's time to take a breath, try to step back, buy some time, try to figure this out rationally. But in no way should we have TikTok go dark,\" Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts said Thursday. \"It would be catastrophic with just so many small businesses, so many creators, so many communities that have been created with no alternative available.\"",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump wants to make Hollywood \"bigger, better and stronger\" and has cast Mel Gibson, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone as stars of what he is calling his \"Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the President-elect announced on his social media site that the three actors would be his eyes and ears to the moviemaking town.",
      "\"It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "He also called the trio special envoys. Special ambassadors and envoys are typically chosen to respond to troubled hot spots like the Middle East, not California.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Thursday, Gibson said he \"got the tweet at the same time as all of you and was just as surprised. Nevertheless, I heed the call. My duty as a citizen is to give any help and insight I can. Any chance the position comes with an Ambassador's residence?\"",
      "Gibson's Malibu home was destroyed in the wildfires which scorched the Los Angeles area.",
      "U.S. film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and, in the past week, the ongoing wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Overall production in the U.S. was down 26% from 2021, according to data from ProdPro.",
      "In the greater L.A. area, productions were down 5.6% from 2023 according to FilmLA, the lowest since 2020. This past October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed expanding California's Film & Television Tax Credit program to $750 million annually, up from $330 million. Other U.S. cities like Atlanta, New York, Chicago and San Francisco have used tax incentives to lure film and TV productions to their cities. Actor Mark Wahlberg is even making plans for a Las Vegas production hub.",
      "It's unclear what exactly Gibson, Voight and Stallone will be doing in this effort to bring productions back to the U.S. Representatives for Voight and Stallone did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
      "Trump's decision to select the actors as his chosen \"ambassadors\" underscores his preoccupations with the 1980s and '90s, when he was a rising tabloid star in New York, and Gibson and Stallone were among the biggest movie stars in the world.",
      "Stallone is a frequent guest at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club and introduced him at a gala in November shortly after the election.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be treasury secretary, Scott Bessent fielded sharp questions Thursday at his confirmation hearing from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS tax filing system.",
      "Bessent told the Senate Finance Committee that the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress doesn't renew provisions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He also argued the Federal Reserve should remain independent from the president's influence and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil should be more aggressive.",
      "He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary \"who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.\" Graham added, \"Your ship came in with this guy.\"",
      "But Democrats, including Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion.",
      "Bennet accused Bessent of shedding \"crocodile tears\" over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. \"There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe\" from the tax cuts.",
      "Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, including Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also asked Bessent a series of questions about reducing national spending to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS' Direct File program \u2014 which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free \u2014 at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers call the program a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular.",
      "He also called for stronger sanctions on Russia, criticizing the Biden administration for a sanctions regime he said isn't \"muscular\" enough. \"I believe the previous administration was worried about raising U.S. energy prices during an election season,\" Bessent said.",
      "Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee, also mulling over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut.",
      "Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident.",
      "\"Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\" Bessent testified.",
      "Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight.",
      "In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. During the hearing, Bessent said he and his husband are up to date on their taxes, and he is in litigation over the portion of his taxes in controversy. He also committed to shuttering his firm if confirmed to be treasury secretary.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump will likely owe the state of New York about half a billion dollars when he's sworn in as president.",
    "story": [
      "Quietly, just before the calendar turned for the new year, an already whopping debt tentatively owed by President-elect Donald Trump and co-defendants in his New York civil fraud case hit an eye-popping, interest-accumulating milestone: half a billion dollars.",
      "Trump, two of his sons and a former executive at his company were ordered in February 2024 to pay $364 million in \"ill-gotten gains\" and millions more in interest dating back years. The figure, which was then $464 million, continued to accrue more than $114,000 in interest per day. The judgment is on appeal.",
      "The total crossed $500 million on Dec. 29, and stands at more than $502 million on Thursday, a spokesperson for New York Attorney General Letitia James confirmed.",
      "Trump, who would personally owe about $490 million of that sum, has banked on a reprieve from New York's mid-level Appellate Division, First Department court. During arguments in September, at least two of five justices on the appeals panel seemed skeptical of the size of the judgment. One called it \"immense\" and \"troubling.\"",
      "But as the defendants await the panel's decision, which is expected early this year, interest has continued to pile up. The court typically releases opinions on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, and the Trump case was not among the batch released today.",
      "That means Trump will likely be sworn in as president on Monday with a debt to the state of New York larger than the combined proposed 2025 budgets for New York's sixth and seventh largest cities, Albany and New Rochelle.",
      "Trump has raged against the debt and the case, in which a judge concluded he and his company manipulated spreadsheets provided to accountants to juice valuations provided to banks and insurers. The result, James' office argued and Judge Arthur Engoron concluded, was that Trump and his company received more favorable terms on loans and insurance deals that they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.",
      "The growing total they may owe the state, known as disgorgement, is equal to the amount Engoron concluded they profited through the scheme, plus interest.",
      "During a later 2023 bench trial in the case, Trump was called to the stand, where he cast blame on his employees and outside accountants, but said his books were compiled accurately. He claimed that, far from overvaluing his assets and net worth, his company \"underestimated\" them.",
      "On top of the half billion owed in the New York civil case, Trump also owes more than $88 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll, after jurors in 2023 and 2024 found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation.",
      "He has denied all allegations in the New York and Carroll cases, and is pursuing appeals in all three.",

      "Faith in Trump's ability to create jobs is a little higher \u2014 about 3 in 10 are extremely or very confident the Republican will make progress on this in 2025 \u2014 but the poll indicates that despite his sweeping promises about lowering prices, a substantial chunk of his own supporters don't have high confidence in his ability to quickly alleviate the economic pressures that continue to frustrate many households.",

      "Fed up with the economy, Americans turn to Trump",
      "Trump's proposed tariffs could raise U.S. grocery prices",
      "Those tempered expectations haven't dampened Republicans' hopes for Trump's second presidential term, though. And Democrats' pessimism about his return to office is more muted than it was when he\u00a0exited\u00a0the White House in 2020. About 8 in 10 Republicans say Trump will be a \"great\" or \"good\" president in his second term, according to the poll.",
      "And while Democrats' assessments are much more negative \u2014 about 8 in 10 say he will be a \"poor\" or \"terrible\" president \u2014 they are less likely to say he'll be a \"terrible\" president in his second term than they were at the end of his\u00a0first.",
      "Much of the 2024 presidential campaign revolved around prices \u2014 whether President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was to blame for inflation and whether Trump could fix it. AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of voters and nonvoters that aims to tell the story behind election results, showed that about 4 in 10 voters in the November election identified the economy and jobs as the most important issue facing the country and that about 6 in 10 of those voters cast their ballot for Trump.",
      "As Trump takes office, though, the poll shows that many Americans don't anticipate that he will be able to immediately bring costs down. That includes some of his own supporters. Less than half of Republicans are at least \"very\" confident that Trump will make progress on lowering food costs, housing costs or health care costs, although about 6 in 10 are at least \"very\" confident in his ability to create jobs.",
      "Confidence in Trump's ability to handle the broader economic situation is also fairly low. Only about one-third of Americans are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident in his ability to handle the economy and jobs. Nearly 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident, and about half are \"slightly confident\" or \"not at all confident.\"",

Similar to the economy and jobs, about one-third of Americans are at least \"very\" confident in Trump's ability to handle immigration and national security, while about 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident and about half are \"slightly\" or \"not at all\" confident.",
      "Americans are especially skeptical of Trump's ability to bring down health care costs or handle the issue of health care at all, the poll found. Only about 2 in 10 Americans are extremely or very confident in his ability to tackle health care issues, and 16% are confident in his ability to make progress on lowering health care costs.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he would look at alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. He has not offered a concrete plan of what his changes to the health care law would be, but he spent a lot of energy during his first term on efforts to dismantle it that were ultimately unsuccessful.",
      "Only about half of Republicans are extremely or very confident in Trump's ability to handle health care, and about one-third are at least very confident he'll make progress on lowering the cost of heath care.",
      "Trump's favorability remains steady",
      "Trump's favorability rating has remained steady through four indictments, a criminal conviction and two attempted assassinations, and the new survey shows that Americans' expectations for his second term match their assessment of his first four years in office. Slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults expect Trump will be a \"terrible\" or \"poor\" president in his second term, essentially unchanged from when he left the White House in 2021.",
      "But Republicans are expecting even bigger things from Trump this time, while Democrats' fears appear to be a little more muted. About half of Republicans say they think Trump will be a \"great\" president in his second term, while about 4 in 10 Republicans described him as a great president at the end of his first term. Democrats still overwhelmingly expect that Trump will be a \"terrible\" president, but that concern has lessened.",

      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",

A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",

      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship. The rocket's upper stage will continue into orbit where flight controllers will carry out a series of tests. Additional flights are planned later this year.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship has a more ambitious agenda befitting its gargantuan size.",
      "As with the two most recent test flights, the first stage will boost the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away and heading back to the launch site for recovery. The Starship, meanwhile, will continue to space on the power of six Raptor engines of its own.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For the third flight in a row, SpaceX planned an attempt to \"catch\" the Super Heavy first stage after it propelled the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, snagging it on the way down using giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks mounted on the launch tower.",
      "The first such catch  last October was successful, a spectacular sight to thousands of  cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later  was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to  sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending  booster into position.",
      "New sensors now have more robust shielding to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets.",
      "But the bulk of the upgrades being tested Thursday are built into what SpaceX calls a \"new generation\" Starship. Multiple systems have been modified to improve performance and to test systems needed for eventual stage recovery.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 20:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dropping hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant in a desperate effort to stop the flames.",
    "story": [
      "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dousing the area with more than water: Hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant have been dropped ahead of the flames in a desperate effort to stop them before they destroy more neighborhoods.",
      "The deadly fires have displaced thousands of residents and destroyed more than 12,000 structures since they began last Tuesday, Jan. 7. Four major fires driven by strong Santa Ana winds have charred about 62 square miles, according to Cal Fire.",
      "Fire agencies say the suppressants \u2014 most often used to fight forest fires \u2014 are an invaluable tool. But what is in them and are they safe?",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "When are fire suppressants used?",
      "The fires are burning quickly through canyons and other rugged areas that are difficult for firefighters on the ground to reach, Cal Fire said.",
      "While fire suppressants can be very effective, they do have limitations, the agency said. Strong winds can make it too dangerous to fly at the low altitudes needed for drops and can dissipate the retardant before it hits the ground.",
      "Besides Cal Fire, multiple agencies have dropped fire retardant and water, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments, the city and the National Guard.",
      "What is in aerial fire suppressants?",
      "Aerial fire suppressants are generally a mixture of water, ammonium phosphate \u2014 essentially fertilizer \u2014 and iron oxide, which is added to make the retardant visible, said Daniel McCurry, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California.",
      "The Forest Service, which has used 13 aircraft to dump suppressants on the Los Angeles fires, says they help starve a fire of oxygen and slow the rate of burn by cooling and coating vegetation and other surfaces.",
      "Perimeter, the company that supplies fire retardant to the Forest Service and other agencies, says the phosphate changes the way cellulose in plants decomposes and makes them non-flammable.",
      "The fire suppressants are generally considered safe for people, but many worry about their potential effects on wildlife.",
      "The Forest Service bans use of aerial suppressants over waterways and endangered species habitats, \"except when human life or public safety are threatened,\" due to potential health effects on fish and other wildlife.",
      "McCurry, from USC, said he and other researchers tested several suppressants and found heavy metals, including chromium and cadmium, in one commonly used by the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "McCurry said the study's findings suggest that it's \"plausible\" that fire suppressants could contribute to spikes of chromium and other heavy metals in waterways downstream of wildfires.",
      "\"We don't quite have a smoking gun yet because it's difficult, although not impossible, to prove where a heavy metal came from,\" McCurry said. \"We're working on that.\"",
      "Perimeter, the manufacturer of the Forest Service's fire retardant, said McCurry's research was on a formulation that wasn't used in California and is no longer used by the Forest Service. The company also says it doesn't add metals, which it says are naturally present in all ammonium phosphate fertilizers, and that its aerial suppressants \"are exhaustively tested by the USDA Forest Service and meet or exceed all health and safety standards.\"",
      "Using flame retardants to protect the power grid",
      "Several Los Angeles area power companies are also using flame retardants to try to help protect power poles and lines, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "Crews have been working for days, stopping at as many power poles as possible along the edges of the wildfires \u2014the Palisades Fire along the Los Angeles coast and the Eaton Fire in the mountains above Pasadena and Altadena.",
      "First, they clear dry shrubbery from the area surrounding the poles, then they use their trucks to douse each power pole with fire retardant \u2014 the same substance that's dropped by firefighting aircraft from above. They try to spray it as far up the pole as possible and into all the cracks, so embers can't get a foothold.",
      "\"That way, if or when the fire does make it this way, we don't have to worry about embers catching it,\" said Connor Norton, one of the PG&E employees working in North Hollywood on Sunday.",
      "\"The best way to save lives\"",
      "The use of fire retardants is imperative to putting out wildfires that expose millions of people to health risks, including from a toxic mix of microscopic particles that can cause breathing and heart problems by penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream.",
      "Studies have shown that wildfire smoke accounted for up to half of all health-damaging particle air pollution in the western U.S. in recent years as warming temperatures fueled more destructive blazes.",
      "And research released last year by the Alzheimer's Association found that wildfire smoke may be worse for brain health than other types of air pollution, raising the risk of dementia.",
      "\"The use of wildland fire retardant is the best way to save lives, protect communities and keep fires small,\" said Edward Goldberg, vice chairman of solutions at Perimeter.",
      "McCurry, the USC researcher, said more study is needed on fire suppressants \u2014 including in Los Angeles once the fires are out \u2014 but he understands their value: \"If there was a brush fire coming for my house, I'd still rather than paint a lot of (fire retardant) in front of it.\"",

      "Though it's not known exactly when they will show up in 2025, they typically appear in May and last through June. During those weeks, the cicadas mature, mate and lay eggs before dying off, and then their offspring begin the cycle anew.",
      "Climate change is also affecting the timing of the insects' arrival. Last year, the cicadas' return started in Georgia nearly two weeks ahead of schedule.",
      "Where will Brood XIV cicadas emerge?",
      "Known as the \"Great(er) Eastern Brood,\" this group is historically found in areas of north Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, southern Indiana and Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts.",
      "However, UConn researchers note that Brood XIV cicadas population are declining on Long Island and their distributions are shifting in southwestern Ohio and southeastern Indiana. The researchers said they will map and study the cicadas' 2025 emergence to address gaps in knowledge about the patterns.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered SpaceX to carry out a formal investigation into the breakup of its Starship rocket during a test flight Thursday that sent a spectacular shower of flaming debris plummeting back to Earth, the agency announced Friday.",
      "\"The FAA is requiring SpaceX to perform a mishap investigation into the loss of the Starship vehicle during launch operations on Jan. 16,\" the FAA said in a statement. \"There are no reports of public injury, and the FAA is working with SpaceX and appropriate authorities to confirm reports of public property damage on Turks and Caicos.\"",
      "Within minutes of the Starship's breakup, along with videos posted on social media showing a shower of debris from a sudden fireball \u2014 possibly propellants igniting in the wake of the failure \u2014 the FAA activated a \"Debris Response Area\" and \"briefly slowed aircraft outside the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\"",
      "Other aircraft were briefly held up at South Florida airports and several \"requested to divert due to low fuel levels while holding outside impacted areas,\" the agency said.",
      "SpaceX, meanwhile, said initial data indicated a fire broke out in the rear part of the Starship, triggering the vehicle's destruction.",
      "\"The Starship upper stage successfully lit all six Raptor engines and performed its ascent burn to space,\" the company said on its web page. \"Prior to the burn's completion, telemetry was lost with the vehicle after approximately eight and a half minutes of flight. Initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly.\"",
      "A \"rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" or RUD, is a description favored by SpaceX founder Elon Musk when referring to catastrophic rocket failures. SpaceX set up a \"debris hotline\" at 1-866-623-0234 and urged anyone who finds Starship wreckage to call or notify the company at recovery@spacex.com.",
      "Mishap occurred during test flight",
      "The mishap occurred during the seventh test flight of a giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket from SpaceX's Gulf Coast manufacturing and flight test center at Boca Chica, Texas.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage chalked up a successful mission, boosting the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, then flipping around and flying back to seaside firing stand where it was plucked out of mid air by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower.",
      "The Starship, meanwhile, continued toward space on the power of its six engines. But about eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, telemetry shared on SpaceX's webcast showed the engines shutting down in a staggered fashion before data suddenly froze and stopped updating.",
      "Numerous photos and videos posted on social media showed smoking debris trails fanning out from a fireball in the late afternoon sky in a scene reminiscent of the shuttle Columbia's breakup in 2003 and the Russian Mir space station's intentional re-entry and disintegration in 2001.",
      "The mishap Thursday is not expected to impact SpaceX's commercial operations. The company dominates the commercial launch industry with its partially reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets launched from Florida and California and those boosters do not share any common elements with the Starship.",
      "But Musk views the Super Heavy-Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, as the future of the company, with both stages designed to fly themselves to rocket-powered landings for rapid refurbishment and re-launch, a key element in the company's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "SpaceX is in the process of ramping up test flights to quickly verify performance, test new ideas, identify problem areas and implement fixes in downstream flights.",
      "How the FAA-mandated investigation might affect the test schedule is not yet known.",
      "\"A mishap investigation is designed to enhance public safety, determine the root cause of the event and identify corrective actions to avoid it from happening again,\" the FAA said.",
      "\"The FAA will be involved in every step of the SpaceX-led mishap investigation process and must approve SpaceX's final report, including any corrective actions. A return to flight is based on the FAA determining that any system, process  or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety.\"",

      "Shrugging off bad weather, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched its powerful New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight early Thursday, lighting up a cloudy overnight sky as it climbed away from Cape Canaveral in a high-stakes bid to compete with Elon Musk's industry-leading SpaceX.",
      "Like SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9, the New Glenn's first stage was designed to fly itself to a landing on a Blue Origin recovery ship after boosting the upper stage out of the lower atmosphere. Reusability is a key element in Bezos' drive to compete with Musk on the high frontier.",
      "The booster did it's job propelling the upper stage into the lower reaches of space. But during its descent to a planned landing on the recovery ship Jacklyn, named after Bezos' mother, telemetry and video from the rocket froze.",
      "\"We may very well have lost the booster,\" a company commentator said.",
      "The company later confirmed that. But recovering the first stage was always a secondary objective. The New Glenn's upper stage reached orbit without any apparent problems, achieving the primary goal of the flight.",
      "\"We did it! Orbital,\" company CEO Dave Limp said on X. \"Great night for Team Blue. On to spring and trying again on the landing.\"",
      "As for the booster, Limp said \"we knew landing our booster ... on the first try was an ambitious goal. We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring. Thank you to all of Team Blue for this incredible milestone.\"",
      "The mission got underway at 2:03 a.m. EST when the New Glenn's seven methane-burning BE-4 engines at the base of the first stage roared to life with a rush of brilliant flame and a ground-shaking roar.",
      "Smoothly accelerating as it consumed propellants and lost weight, the  New Glenn streaked away from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force  Station atop a brilliant blue-white plume, putting on a spectacular show for  cheering Blue Origin employees, area residents and tourists.",
      "The launch came a week later than originally planned because of rough weather in the booster landing zone and, once, because of a minor technical problem. But it appeared to be clear sailing Thursday as the rocket climbed away and disappeared from view.",
      "Three minutes and 10 seconds after liftoff, the rocket's first stage engines shut down, triggering stage separation and ignition of the two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines powering the rocket's second stage.",
      "As the upper stage continued the climb to orbit, the first stage briefly coasted upward before arcing over and falling back to Earth, homing in on the Jacklyn, which was standing by several hundred miles downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. NASA's WB-57 photo-reconnaissance jet was flying nearby, documenting the flight with high-resolution cameras.",
      "Three engines re-ignited as planned to slow the booster for re-entry but during the burn, video showing one of the engines froze and on-screen telemetry stopped while showing an altitude of 84,226 feet and a velocity of 4,285 mph. Whether the rocket exploded or suffered some other malfunction and crashed into the sea was not immediately known.",
      "But company officials said before launch that they would learn from any anomalies and press ahead with another flight in the next few months.",
      "\"We have another one (in production), and it'll be coming off the line here shortly,\" Limp told CBS News earlier this week. \"So we'll fly (again) either way in the spring.\"",
      "While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin opted to make the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. That was based in part on the company's experience launching and landing its sub-orbital New Shepard rocket, used to carry space tourists, researchers and payloads on brief up-and-down flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "Even so, company officials acknowledged the challenge, naming the New Glenn first stage \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "\"There's no question that it's a bit audacious to try to land it the first time,\" Limp said before launch.",
      "But the first stage landing was just one of several major objectives. The primary goal of the flight was to put the upper stage into orbit, along with a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as the Blue Ring Pathfinder. A sort of space tug, the Blue Ring can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing on-board computer support and even servicing.",
      "For its initial flight, the Blue Ring was to remain attached to the New Glenn's upper stage throughout the planned five-hour 50-minute mission.",
      "The flight plan called for two firings of the upper stage engines, with the second coming about an hour after liftoff, to put the vehicle and the attached Blue Ring Pathfinder in an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet. It features 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other instruments weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck.",
      "There are no such payloads on the initial flight, but the spacecraft's systems will undergo a series of tests to learn more about how the craft performs in space.",
      "Regardless of the results of Thursday's mission, Blue Origin will face an uphill battle with SpaceX, which currently dominates the commercial launch market.",
      "Musk had kind words about the launch in a post on his X platform, saying, \"Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!\"",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and since then has fired off 436 Falcon 9-family missions with only two in-flight failures.",
      "Complicating the picture for Blue Origin, SpaceX is in the process of testing a gargantuan, fully reusable rocket known as the Super Heavy-Starship. It is the most powerful rocket ever built, and once operational is expected to play a major role in launching payloads to low-Earth orbit, the moon and beyond.",
      "SpaceX plans to launch a Super Heavy-Starship from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test center on Thursday at 5 p.m. EST.",
      "After boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, the Super Heavy booster is designed to fly back to its launch pad, where giant mechanical arms would attempt to pluck it out of mid-air. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, would loop around the planet, launching 10 mockup Starlink satellites before a simulated landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019, with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "How Blue Origin and other rocket builders will complete with SpaceX, it's Falcon-family rockets and the Super Heavy-Starship remains to be seen.",
      "But Blue Origin already has a backlog of satellites awaiting launch on its New Glenn and is awaiting certification to launch high-priority national security payloads, NASA probes and other civilian satellites.",
      "Amazon plans to launch more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper to provide space-based internet services in direct competition with SpaceX's Starlink.",
      "Blue Origin says it has booked 80 launches using New Glenn rockets and boosters provided by the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"I'm very bullish about space in general,\" Limp said. \"I think there's going to be lots of winners in this segment. It might be SpaceX; I think Blue will be there. But I also believe there's going to be new companies that we've never even heard of yet. There's some entrepreneur out there that hasn't started a space company that's going to be at the table.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:08:29 -0500",
    "summary": "If the weather cooperates, the Starship launch will follow the maiden flight of Jeff Bezos' already weather-delayed New Glenn rocket.",
    "story": [
      "After launching more than 100 small payloads from California on Tuesday and two commercial moon landers from Florida early Wednesday, both atop Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship for a ground-shaking launch from the Texas Gulf Coast to kick off the program's seventh test flight.",
      "But bad weather prompted the California rocket builder to delay the high-profile flight to Thursday, when it will follow a NASA spacewalk outside the International Space Station and the launch of Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight.",
      "The New Glenn is scheduled for its own weather-delayed liftoff from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1 a.m. EST, the opening of a three-hour launch window.",
      "Six hours later, space station astronauts Nick Hague and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams plan to venture outside the NASA lab complex for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk starting around 8 a.m. to carry out a variety of maintenance and upgrade tasks.",
      "That will set the stage for the Super Heavy-Starship launch from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility at 5 p.m. EST, weather permitting.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",
      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship. The rocket's upper stage will continue into orbit where flight controllers will carry out a series of tests. Additional flights are planned later this year.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship has a more ambitious agenda befitting its gargantuan size.",
      "As with the two most recent test flights, the first stage will boost the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away and heading back to the launch site for recovery. The Starship, meanwhile, will continue to space on the power of six Raptor engines of its own.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For the third flight in a row, SpaceX planned an attempt to \"catch\" the Super Heavy first stage after it propelled the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, snagging it on the way down using giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks mounted on the launch tower.",
      "The first such catch  last October was successful, a spectacular sight to thousands of  cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later  was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to  sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending  booster into position.",
      "New sensors now have more robust shielding to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets.",
      "But the bulk of the upgrades being tested Thursday are built into what SpaceX calls a \"new generation\" Starship. Multiple systems have been modified to improve performance and to test systems needed for eventual stage recovery.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",

    "story": [
      "With the nearly full moon shining overhead, two companies, one American and the other headquartered in Japan, launched privately developed robotic lunar landers early Wednesday, sharing a sky-lighting ride to space atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "The U.S. lander, built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and known as \"Blue Ghost,\" is carrying 10 sophisticated instruments for NASA while the Japanese spacecraft, built by Tokyo-based ispace and known as \"Resilience,\" is carrying four instruments of its own and a small microrover known as \"Tenacious.\"",
      "Mounted one atop the other in the nose cone of the Falcon 9, liftoff from historic pad 39A came on time at 1:11 a.m. EST Wednesday. Blue Ghost, weighing 1,033 pounds without propellant, was released to fly on its own one hour and five minutes after liftoff.",
      "Resilience, which weighs about 750 pounds, was deployed 21 minutes later, after the Falcon 9 carried out a final second stage engine firing to put the craft on a different trajectory.",
      "\"Our customers have different strategies for arriving to the moon, and Falcon 9's abilities enable us to deliver each lander to their respective injection orbits to complete their missions,\" said Julianna Scheiman, a senior SpaceX manager.",
      "The landers are taking very different routes to the moon. Blue Ghost is expected to spend about 25 days in Earth orbit, giving Firefly engineers time to thoroughly check out the craft's instruments, propulsion and other subsystems. The craft then will fire its engines for a four-day trip to the moon, followed by 16 days in lunar orbit.",
      "If no major problems develop, Blue Ghost, 6.6 feet tall and 11.5 feet wide, then will descend to the surface near the center of Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 touching down on four shock-absorbing legs. Its 10 science instruments will have two full weeks, or a lunar \"day,\" to collect data.",
      "\"The research we gather will help unlock future space exploration, while also benefiting life on Earth, with new insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect our planet,\" said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",
      "\"Each milestone we complete will provide valuable data for future missions and ultimately keep the United States and our international partners at the forefront of space exploration.\"",
      "Unlike Blue Ghost, ispace's Resilience, also known as Hakuto-R, will head for the moon about two days after launch, using a low-energy fuel-saving trajectory. One month later, the craft will fly past the moon, using its gravity to adjust the flight path before entering orbit about four months after launch. Two weeks after that, Resilience will attempt its own landing at Mare Frigoris, the Sea of Cold.",
      "ispace launched its first Hakuto lander in late 2022, but flight controllers lost contact the following March as the spacecraft was nearing the moon's surface.",
      "Investigators later determined the onboard software misinterpreted the lander's altitude after flying over the rim of a crater. The vehicle subsequently ran out of propellant and crashed to the surface.",
      "That problem has been corrected, ispace says, prompting the company to name its second Hakuto lander \"Resilience.\" ispace officials are optimistic about its chances the second time around.",
      "\"We've got experiments that I think are going to help with the establishment of lunar infrastructure that will eventually, hopefully lead to a permanent, significant human presence on the moon,\" said Ron Garan, a former space shuttle astronaut and CEO of ispace USA.",
      "\"We're doing an electrolysis experiment. We're doing a food production experiment. We also have some art installations.\"",
      "A model of a Swedish house will be carried away from the lander on the rover, which will \"set it down on the lunar surface,\" Garan said. \"We're going to photograph it, and it's a really exciting artistic endeavor as well.\"",
      "Garan called the microrover, built by ispace's Luxembourg-based unit and measuring just 10.2 inches tall and 21.6 inches long, \"really critical to the future of our company.\"",
      "\"The data that's going to come off the rover is going to be really valuable to us as we continue to hone our design on the surface mobility aspect of the business,\" he said. \"And so, that's really exciting, too.\"",
      "The Resilience mission is privately funded, without any financing from NASA. The instruments aboard Blue Ghost, in contrast, cost NASA $44 million to develop. The agency agreed to pay Firefly $101 million to carry them to the moon as part of its\u00a0Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's science mission directorate.",
      "\"To date, five vendors have been awarded 11 lunar deliveries under CLPS and are sending more than 50 instruments to various locations on the moon, including the lunar South Pole. Existing CLPS contracts (have) a cumulative maximum contract value of $2.6 billion through 2028. No other nation has done this.\"",
      "The Blue Ghost instruments will collect data on the lunar dust environment, drill into the soil below the lander, monitor background X-ray emissions, test whether Earth-orbiting navigation satellites can be used near the moon and the effectiveness of computer radiation shielding, among other topics of interest.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Fox.",
      "\"The technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost mission will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments and most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Kim said the Blue Ghost mission will span about two months.",
      "\"After Blue Ghost lands on the moon, we'll be collecting critical payload science data throughout the entire mission,\" he said. \"We'll then wrap up the mission by capturing a solar eclipse and a lunar sunset in high definition video before operating several hours into the lunar night.\"",
      "Toward the end of the mission, the company hopes to capture a phenomenon first seen by NASA's Surveyor moon landers and at least two Apollo crews, a so-called \"horizon glow\" caused by sunlight interacting with small dust particles kicked up by solar radiation and micrometeoroid impacts.",
      "\"Knowing that Firefly's Blue Ghost mission is a culmination of what the last Apollo astronaut to walk on the moon observed is a fitting tribute to their legacy,\" Kim said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. could be in for a rude awakening come Sunday if they suddenly find the enormously popular video-sharing app is inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.",
      "Lawmakers and U.S. officials have sounded the alarm for years about the supposed risks that TikTok's ties to China pose to national security, and Congress moved last year to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",
      "That deadline is now here, with no sign of a sale in sight. TikTok's last-ditch legal challenge failed on Friday, when the Supreme Court said the law does not violate the First Amendment.",

Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them.

      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0as soon as Sunday if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "The\u00a0Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, that would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok.",
      "The Biden administration and lawmakers\u00a0say TikTok poses a threat\u00a0to U.S. national security, warning that the Chinese government can use the app to collect information and otherwise snoop on American users of the app. For its part, TikTok and some content creators on the platform argued the law violates their First Amendment rights to free speech.",
      "TikTok could evade a ban if ByteDance agreed to sell its American operations to a U.S. entity. Bloomberg reported\u00a0Tuesday that Elon Musk could have interest in such a deal. Still, Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "TikTok has said it could go dark in the U.S. on Jan. 19.\u00a0But it remains unclear if President-elect Donald Trump, who had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law, will intervene and seek a solution once he takes office.",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",

      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",

      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",

    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

    "title": "Does the tech industry really need so many workers on H-1B visas?",
    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday declared the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy unlawful, casting a cloud of uncertainty over more than half a million unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as children ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.",
      "A panel of judges before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that found that a Biden administration rule to codify DACA violated U.S. immigration law. The 2012 Obama administration memo that originally created the policy has also been found to be unlawful by federal courts.",
      "Friday's ruling, however, will not immediately change the status quo. By suspending its order, the panel of judges kept DACA alive for current recipients and closed to new applicants, as the program has been operating for the past few years.",
      "For more than 12 years, DACA has allowed hundreds of thousands of immigrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas as minors to live and work in the U.S., without fear of deportation. They are colloquially known as \"Dreamers,\" a moniker stemming from the Dream Act, a bipartisan effort to legalize them that Congress has considered, but failed to pass, for over two decades.",
      "While it affirmed the lower court order that voided the Biden administration's DACA regulation, the 5th Circuit panel narrowed the ruling's impact, making it applicable only in Texas, the state spearheading the Republican-led lawsuit against the program. The panel paused its ruling as it relates to current DACA beneficiaries, pending another ruling by the 5th Circuit or the Supreme Court, allowing renewals to continue.",
      "The panel also ruled that the deportation deferrals offered by DACA could be legally separated from the work permits that beneficiaries receive, giving the Biden administration a partial victory on its argument that the deportation protections should be left intact if the work authorization provision is struck down.",
      "As of the end of September 2024, there were roughly 538,000 immigrants enrolled in DACA, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees the initiative. To qualify for the policy, applicants had to establish they arrived in the U.S. by their 16th birthday and before June 2007; graduated from an American high school or enrolled in the military; and lacked any serious criminal records.",
      "Friday's ruling could pave the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to finally settle the years-long legal battle over DACA. But it's unclear how the incoming Trump administration will handle the case and whether it will try to terminate the program. While President Biden's Justice Department has vigorously defended DACA in court, the first Trump administration tried phasing out the policy, arguing it was unlawful. The Supreme Court in 2020 prevented DACA's termination on technical grounds.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on Friday's court order.",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately say how the incoming administration would approach DACA. Trump and his advisers have pledged to launch a sweeping crackdown on illegal and legal immigration, vowing to oversee mass deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally, enact tougher border controls and cut legal admissions of immigrants and refugees.",

    "summary": "U.S. officials have long feared that the widely popular short-form video app could be used as a vehicle for espionage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. could be in for a rude awakening come Sunday if they suddenly find the enormously popular video-sharing app is inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.",
      "Lawmakers and U.S. officials have sounded the alarm for years about the supposed risks that TikTok's ties to China pose to national security, and Congress moved last year to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",
      "That deadline is now here, with no sign of a sale in sight. TikTok's last-ditch legal challenge failed on Friday, when the Supreme Court said the law does not violate the First Amendment.",
      "The Biden White House said it will leave enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration, and President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to \"save\" the app. But TikTok has hinted that it could still take itself offline once the law is in effect, a move that would leave content creators and users in the lurch as the company seeks a way to get back on firm legal footing.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that \"the statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",

    "summary": "Experts say no other app offers the same financial opportunities as TikTok, while creators fear loss of income if it disappears.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a challenge to a new law requiring TikTok to either sever ties with its China-based parent company or be banned in the United States, finding it did not violate the First Amendment rights of the platform or its users.",
      "The high court's unsigned decision clears the way for the law, passed last April, to take effect at midnight Sunday, and follows years of concerns raised by the federal government \u2014 during both the Trump and Biden administrations \u2014 about the risks TikTok poses to national security.",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",

The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat.",
      "What the Supreme Court said in its ruling on the TikTok ban",
      "\"The act's prohibitions and divestiture requirement are designed to prevent China \u2014 a designated foreign adversary \u2014 from leveraging its control over ByteDance Ltd. to capture the personal data of U.S. TikTok users. This objective qualifies as an important government interest under intermediate scrutiny,\" the court said, referencing the middle standard applied by courts to assess the constitutionality of a law.",
      "Under intermediate scrutiny, a challenged law must further an important government interest and be substantially related to that interest to be upheld. It is a less demanding standard than strict scrutiny, the highest level of judicial review, and more stringent than rational-basis review, the lowest, most lenient tier.",
      "The court noted that TikTok \"collects extensive personal information from and about its users,\" including location data and contact lists. The justices reiterated the government's concerns that such information may allow China to track the locations of federal employees, craft dossiers of information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.",
      "The court's opinion also cited Congress' finding that under Chinese law, companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" it said.",
      "The court went on to say that the law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, is \"sufficiently tailored to address the government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary from collecting vast swaths of sensitive data about the 170 million U.S. persons who use TikTok.\"",
      "Its provisions \"clearly serve the government's data collection interest,\" the court said, and are not broader than needed to address concerns about China's access to Americans' personal information.",
      "The court noted the government's interest in preventing China from having control over TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and its ability to covertly alter the content appearing on the app for users in the U.S. But it said the record in the case \"adequately supports the conclusion that Congress would have passed the challenged provisions based on the data collection justification alone.\"",
      "According to Congress and the Biden administration, the court said, ByteDance uses data collected from TikTok to train the app's recommendation algorithm and would not agree to stop collecting U.S. users' data or sending it to China. The government also noted the challenges with monitoring data-sharing between TikTok and its parent company.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, we find the government's data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions,\" the court said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch issued a separate opinion agreeing with the outcome of the case, but splitting with the court's legal reasoning. He wrote that the court was right to refrain from endorsing the government's goal of preventing the purported covert manipulation of content by China.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" he wrote. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "Gorsuch concluded his opinion by noting that \"speaking with and in favor of a foreign adversary is one thing. Allowing a foreign adversary to spy on Americans is another.\"",
      "The law at issue in the case requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had\u00a0urged the court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office, but said following the ruling that he \"must have time to review the situation.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",

    "story": [
      "Driven by \"curiosity,\" a U.S. Navy corpsman attempted to access President Biden's medical records last year following a group discussion with his colleagues about military security protocols for using government computers, according to the federal criminal investigation obtained by CBS News.",
      "In July, CBS News reported a junior U.S. Navy sailor attempted to gain access to Mr. Biden's medical records but was unable to do so and was subsequently administratively reprimanded for the unauthorized query.",
      "CBS News filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the civilian law enforcement agency responsible for criminal investigations within the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. On Friday, NCIS released its closed investigation to CBS News.",
      "The investigation details how a low-ranking U.S. Navy corpsman attempted to access the president's medical records and the penalty he received for doing so \u2014 a nonjudicial punishment for dereliction of duty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the laws and regulations governing the U.S. military.",
      "The corpsman, whose name the Navy will not disclose, was demoted in rank to E-2 from E-3, given 20 days of extra duty and only received half pay for the next six months. Base pay for an E-2 with two to three years of service is roughly $2,260 per month.",
      "On the afternoon of Feb. 22, according to the NCIS documents, the Navy corpsman sat at his desk, surrounded by the steady hum of computers and the murmurs of his coworkers at the Naval Medical Readiness and Training Center at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. A civilian described as a licensed nurse and a U.S. Army soldier worked nearby.",
      "The scene was standard bureaucratic fare until a nearby colleague left her workstation, leaving her Common Access Card, or CAC, behind \u2014 which was still logged into her account. This small, unassuming piece of plastic, roughly the size of a credit card, is described by the Defense Department as a \"smart\" key, granting access to everything from locked doors to military computer networks.",
      "The group of medical professionals struck up a conversation and started talking about the security risk of leaving a CAC unattended in a computer.",
      "One of the unnamed individuals pointed out the glaring vulnerability: \"Someone could maliciously use your CAC when you walk away,\" they said, according to the narrative of the group discussion within the NCIS investigation.",
      "Another voice in the group floated the idea that someone could use an unattended CAC account to snoop on the president's medical records. The notion hung in the air. The Navy corpsman responded with apparent disbelief \u2014 could he actually pull up the medical records for the president of the United States? He decided to test it, according to the NCIS investigation.",
      "The Navy corpsman told NCIS investigators he was driven by curiosity, so he pulled up the patient search database in the Genesis Medical Health System \u2014 the database for the military medical system \u2014 and typed in the name \"Joseph Biden.\"",
      "A single record with the name \"Joseph Biden\" appeared, with a birthdate attached. The NCIS investigation stated that when the file popped up, the Navy corpsman and his coworkers were \"freaked out,\" with one of his colleagues walking away from the computer.",
      "The Navy corpsman then turned to Google to look up Mr. Biden's birthdate, and saw that it matched the birthdate on the medical file. He clicked into the record to see what information was inside.",
      "The corpsman would later tell NCIS investigators that \"there was not a lot of information in the record, except two instances,\" and \"[he] did not remember the specifics of the instances, but remembered a doctor's name was listed.\" The corpsman turned to Google again and searched for the name of Mr. Biden's doctor, which did not match the name listed on the Genesis record, according to the investigation.",
      "The corpsman told NCIS agents that he realized at this point he should stop looking at the record and closed out the file. A forensic analysis showed that the \"Joseph Biden\" file was accessed for about 20 seconds, between 1:22 p.m. and 1:23 p.m.",
      "A female colleague, who was aware the corpsman searched the system for the president, advised him to report himself to his supervisor. The corpsman stated he knew he was going to be reported for violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the federal law designed to protect patients' health information.",
      "He didn't immediately report himself, but told investigators he felt guilty so he reported himself the next morning. By then, however, another colleague had already reported the violation up the chain of command. The corpsman waived his rights and confessed to accessing the record out of curiosity.",
      "The corpsman said he did not \"print, save, email, download, photograph, or otherwise document the record.\" Another colleague told investigators they had never heard the corpsman express \"anything about his political beliefs or background,\" and that he was \"nonchalant\" until the file popped up, describing him as \"freaked out.\"",
      "The Naval Criminal Investigative Service launched its investigation on Feb. 26. On Feb. 27, the deputy director of the White House medical unit \u2014 identified as a U.S. Army officer in the NCIS report \u2014 told investigators that the record accessed by the corpsman was not a legitimate electronic health record of the president.",
      "The president was informed about the sailor's attempts to access his medical records within hours of White House staff being notified about the attempted breach by the Defense Department, a White House official told CBS News in July.",
      "The president underwent his annual physical at Walter Reed on Feb. 28, two days after the Navy's criminal investigation began. The president was deemed \"fit for duty\" by his doctor after the physical that lasted about two and a half hours.",
      "NCIS agents also looked through the corpsman's social media accounts. Agents found that his profile picture on Instagram, when run though a reverse image search, \"revealed imagery potentially associated with the online 'hactivist' group Anonymous.\" It's not clear from the investigation if any actual link was confirmed by NCIS agents between the corpsman and Anonymous.",
      "The corpsman's MSI laptop and Apple iPhone were seized by NCIS investigators, with the corpsman cooperating fully. The laptop's internet browser history showed that the sailor conducted searches for \"Biden, Doctor, Flights, Anonymous, President, POTUS.\" A text message shows the corpsman telling an unnamed person that he \"looked up Joe Biden.\" The laptop and phone were later returned.",

      "The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit on Friday accusing Walgreens of filling millions of unlawful opioid prescriptions.",
      "The civil suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Walgreen Boots Alliance, Walgreen Co. and its various subsidiaries   alleges the pharmacy giant knowingly filled millions of unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances from approximately August 2012 through to the present. Walgreens allegedly filled prescriptions for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, the lawsuit said, including early refills among other prescriptions.",
      "\"Our complaint alleges that Walgreens pharmacists filled millions of controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated the prescriptions were highly likely to be unlawful, and that Walgreens systematically pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions, including controlled substance prescriptions, without taking the time needed to confirm their validity,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a statement. \"These practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\"",
      "Walgreens pharmacists filled these unlawful prescriptions despite clear \"red flags,\" the complaint alleges, and the pharmacy giant ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources that its stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, the suit claims.",
      "Pharmacists were pressured to fill prescriptions quickly without taking the time needed to confirm each prescription's validity, the complaint said. Walgreens also deprived pharmacists of crucial information and prevented them from warning one another about certain prescribers.",
      "Four different whistleblowers who previously worked for Walgreens in various parts of the country filed whistleblower actions, the statement said.",
      "Walgreens responded to the lawsuit in a statement on its website which read that it stands \"behind our pharmacists, dedicated healthcare professionals who live in the communities they serve, filling legitimate prescriptions for FDA-approved medications written by DEA-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\"",
      "\"We look forward to the opportunity to defend the professionalism and integrity of our pharmacists,\" the statement said.",
      "Last month the Justice Department\u00a0filed a similar lawsuit against CVS, alleging the pharmacy chain filled prescriptions with dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, agreed to fill opioid prescriptions early and made \"trinity prescriptions,\" which are a dangerous combination of drugs.",
      "Walgreens is one of the country's largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 pharmacies across the U.S. Walgreens plans to close hundreds of stores by the end of 2025 to turn around its flagging sales, and has already closed roughly 2,000 locations over the past decade, the company said.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:05:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The jury deliberated for more than eight hours starting before ruling in favor of Zachary Young in his defamation suit against CNN.",
    "story": [
      "A Florida jury on Friday found that CNN defamed a U.S. Navy veteran in a 2021 story about people paid to rescue endangered Afghans following the Taliban takeover\u00a0of that country.",
      "It was an unusual ruling against a media outlet in a defamation case. Libel laws are generally protective of news organizations, and plaintiffs must meet a high standard to prove defamation.",
      "The jury in Panama City, Florida, deliberated for more than eight hours starting Thursday before ruling in favor of Zachary Young, who blamed CNN for destroying his business by showing his face onscreen in a story about a \"black market\" of smuggling out desperate Afghans for high fees.",
      "The jury awarded Young $5 million in compensatory damages. An undisclosed settlement was reached later Friday regarding punitive damages, according to the judge overseeing the case. Details of that settlement were not immediately available.",
      "Young had argued that his business targeted sponsors who could afford to pay for Afghans to get out, not individual Afghans charged as much as $10,000 for the service. While CNN said it was wrong to use the phrase \"black market,\" it contended that its reporting on Young was accurate.",
      "CNN told The Associated Press that it would have no comment on the verdict. But it sent a statement to the website Mediaite saying: \"We remain proud of our journalists and are 100% committed to strong, fearless and fair-minded reporting at CNN, though we will of course take what useful lessons we can from this case.\"",
      "At a trial located in a conservative part of the country, Young's lawyers urged jurors to send a message to the media. Questions submitted by jurors during the trial telegraphed some hostility, with one wondering whether CNN had treated the plaintiff as guilty until proven innocent.",
      "Private messages also became part of the trial, with plaintiffs showing internal messages where CNN's reporter, Alex Marquardt, said some profane and unflattering things about Young. Marquardt testified in the trial that his story \"was not a hit piece.\"",
      "Marquardt's story first aired on Nov. 11, 2021, during Jake Tapper's CNN broadcast, and subsequent printed stories were used on the network's website.",
      "Defamation trials are actually rare in the United States, in part because the strong constitutional protections for the press make proving libel difficult. From the media's standpoint, taking a case to a judge or jury is a risk many executives don't want to take.",
      "Rather than defend statements that George Stephanopoulos made about Trump last spring, ABC News last month agreed to make the former president's libel lawsuit go away by paying him $15 million toward his presidential library. In the end, ABC parent Walt Disney Co. concluded an ongoing fight against Trump wasn't worth it, win or lose.",
      "In another case, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems $787 million on the day the trial was due to start in 2023 to settle the company's claims of inaccurate reporting in the wake of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "With the verdict in, lawyers were hearing testimony during the punitive damage phase of the trial about the overall financial health of CNN.",

      "It also helps that that he has been honing these skills for essentially his entire life, listening to games and announcing along. As he got older, he read and researched and memorized, amassing an encyclopedic knowledge of sports.",

      "Unrivaled, the U.S. basketball league co-founded by WNBA stars Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, is ready for its closeup.",
      "The new 3-on-3 women's basketball league will debut Friday night, a couple of years after the idea of starting a domestic league to bolster athletes' salaries during the WNBA's offseason without them having to go overseas.",
      "\"Because a lot of players probably my age and a little bit older are so accustomed to going overseas,\" Stewart told CBS News. \"And now it's like, no, you play WNBA. You come to Unrivaled and we're gonna take care of you. We're gonna pay you. We're gonna make sure you continue to build your brand.",
      "Both Collier and Stewart have played for teams overseas: Collier in France and Stewart in Turkey.",
      "What is Unrivaled basketball?",
      "Unrivaled is a new 3-on-3 women's professional basketball league where six teams, with each six players on each squad, compete for the title.",
      "The league will feature\u00a036 WNBA players, including the two co-founders, whose teams will play against each other on opening night. Sensational WNBA rookie Angel Reese's team plays in the second contest. Other WNBA stars fans can see include Sabrina Ionescu, Satou Sabally, Alyssa Thomas and Arike Ogunbowale.",
      "\"I think I'll be taking it all in in the introductions,\" Collier said. \"Once the ball goes up, it's just the game.\"",
      "The games will be played on a court\u00a0that's about 20 feet shorter\u00a0than the WNBA court.",
      "Unrivaled basketball rules",
      "There will be three seven-minute quarters and a fourth quarter that isn't timed. Teams will play to a \"winning score\" which will be determined by adding 11 points to the squad which is leading after three quarters. For example: If Team X is leading 60-55 after three quarters, the first team to 71 would win the game.",
      "\"Every game, we will have a game-winning shot,\" Unrivaled President Alex Bazzell said. \"That was important for us because coming out of the third quarter, there's no mysteries of what you need to do.\"",
      "There will only be one free throw taken when players commit shooting fouls with the value of it equal to the shot. That means if a player is fouled shooting a 3-pointer, a made free throw will count for three points. A free throw after being fouled on a two-point attempt is worth two points and any and-1 situation is worth one point.",
      "There will be an 18-second shot clock instead of 24 seconds that the players use in the WNBA. The clock will stop on made baskets in the final 30 seconds of a quarter as opposed to the last minute used in the WNBA.",
      "How much are Unrivaled athletes getting paid?",
      "Nearly all the players are making more than $100,000. The average player salary is the highest ever for any women's sports league. There is more than $8 million in the salary pool.",
      "Players also are getting an equity stake in the league. The league is also holding a 1-on-1 tournament in February and the winner will be paid $250,000. Each player on the winner's Unrivaled team will also receive $10,000.",
      "Same as WNBA games, players took part in a half-court shootout after their morning practices. Shakira Austin made the first one and earned $100 for her efforts. She went last as the youngest player on the Lunar Owls and had the advantage of knowing that the shorter court meant a closer shot.",
      "\"It's a great start to the day,\" Austin said.",
      "While the halfcourt money is the same, players are making a lot more as the league\u00a0boasts the highest average salary\u00a0for a professional women's league.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 16:33:40 -0500",
    "summary": "The case involves whether parents' religious rights were violated when a Maryland school district declined to allow them to opt their children out of gender and sexuality instruction.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to take up a dispute over whether a Maryland school district violated parents' religious rights when it declined to allow them to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving storybooks about gender and sexuality.",
      "The dispute centers around a decision by the Montgomery County School Board to end opt-out requests and notice requirements for the reading and discussion of storybooks that feature LGBTQ characters. The case sets up another clash involving LGBTQ rights and religious rights. It's unclear whether the Supreme Court will hear arguments in its current term, which ends this summer, or its next term that will begin in October.",
      "The books were approved for the Montgomery County Public Schools language-arts curriculum for the 2022-2023 school year as part of an effort to include new material that better represents the school district's students and families, it said. Montgomery County is Maryland's largest county and its school system serves more than 160,000 students.",
      "Books introduced for students include titles like \"Pride Puppy,\" a picture book about a dog that gets lost at a Pride parade, and \"Jacob's Room to Choose,\" about two transgender school-aged children.",
      "Lawyers for the school district said in court filings that the books \"impart critical reading skills through engaging, age-appropriate stories,\" and the district follows a \"careful, public, participatory selection process\" to ensure they meet that criteria. The books are made available for individual reading, classroom read-alouds and other educational activities, according to the school district.",
      "After the books were introduced, some parents sought to have their children excused when they were read or discussed. Some of these so-called out-out requests were religious-based and others were not, according to court filings. Lawyers for the board said that while teachers and principals attempted to accommodate the requests, the number grew and raised concerns about student absenteeism, the feasibility of administering opt-outs throughout the district and the \"risk of exposing students who believe the storybooks represent them and their families to social stigma and isolation.\"",
      "The district then announced in March 2023 that it wouldn't allow opt-outs from language-arts instruction that involved the storybooks \"for any reason.\"",
      "The decision sparked backlash from the community, and more than 1,000 parents signed a petition urging the board to reinstate their notice and opt-out requests. Hundreds also attended school board meetings and said they had religious obligations not to subject their children to gender and sexuality instruction that conflicted with their religious beliefs.",
      "Following the school district's announcement, in May 2023, three sets of parents sued the Montgomery County Board of Education, alleging their First Amendment and due process rights were violated. The lead challengers are Tamer Mahmoud and Enas Barakat, who are Muslim and have a son in elementary school. Also challenging the board's move are Chris and Melissa Persak, who are Roman Catholic and have two elementary-age children, and Jeff and Svitlana Roman, who are Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox and have a son in elementary school.",
      "They sought a court order that would require notice and opt outs when the books were read or discussed. The parents argued their children's exposure to the books \"necessarily establishes the existence of a burden\" on their right to freely exercise their religion.",
      "A federal district court denied the request, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the decision.",
      "The divided three-judge panel found that there was no evidence at that time that the families were compelled to change their religious beliefs or conduct, or what they taught their children.",
      "The parents then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the 4th Circuit's decision effectively requires parents to \"surrender their right to direct the religious upbringing of their children by sending them to public schools.\"",
      "\"Under the Fourth Circuit's reasoning, parents cannot be heard until after the damage has been done to their children. But there is no unringing that bell \u2014 by then, innocence will be lost and beliefs undermined,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "But the school board urged the Supreme Court to turn away the case.",
      "They said the parents \"seek to unsettle a decades-old consensus that parents who choose to send their children to public school are not deprived of their right to freely exercise their religion simply because their children are exposed to curricular materials the parents find offensive.\"",

    "summary": "A fire in the aft section of SpaceX's Starship trigged the apparent explosion that destroyed the spacecraft, the company says.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered SpaceX to carry out a formal investigation into the breakup of its Starship rocket during a test flight Thursday that sent a spectacular shower of flaming debris plummeting back to Earth, the agency announced Friday.",
      "\"The FAA is requiring SpaceX to perform a mishap investigation into the loss of the Starship vehicle during launch operations on Jan. 16,\" the FAA said in a statement. \"There are no reports of public injury, and the FAA is working with SpaceX and appropriate authorities to confirm reports of public property damage on Turks and Caicos.\"",
      "Within minutes of the Starship's breakup, along with videos posted on social media showing a shower of debris from a sudden fireball \u2014 possibly propellants igniting in the wake of the failure \u2014 the FAA activated a \"Debris Response Area\" and \"briefly slowed aircraft outside the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\"",
      "Other aircraft were briefly held up at South Florida airports and several \"requested to divert due to low fuel levels while holding outside impacted areas,\" the agency said.",
      "SpaceX, meanwhile, said initial data indicated a fire broke out in the rear part of the Starship, triggering the vehicle's destruction.",
      "\"The Starship upper stage successfully lit all six Raptor engines and performed its ascent burn to space,\" the company said on its web page. \"Prior to the burn's completion, telemetry was lost with the vehicle after approximately eight and a half minutes of flight. Initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly.\"",
      "A \"rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" or RUD, is a description favored by SpaceX founder Elon Musk when referring to catastrophic rocket failures. SpaceX set up a \"debris hotline\" at 1-866-623-0234 and urged anyone who finds Starship wreckage to call or notify the company at recovery@spacex.com.",
      "Mishap occurred during test flight",
      "The mishap occurred during the seventh test flight of a giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket from SpaceX's Gulf Coast manufacturing and flight test center at Boca Chica, Texas.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage chalked up a successful mission, boosting the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, then flipping around and flying back to seaside firing stand where it was plucked out of mid air by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower.",
      "The Starship, meanwhile, continued toward space on the power of its six engines. But about eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, telemetry shared on SpaceX's webcast showed the engines shutting down in a staggered fashion before data suddenly froze and stopped updating.",
      "Numerous photos and videos posted on social media showed smoking debris trails fanning out from a fireball in the late afternoon sky in a scene reminiscent of the shuttle Columbia's breakup in 2003 and the Russian Mir space station's intentional re-entry and disintegration in 2001.",
      "The mishap Thursday is not expected to impact SpaceX's commercial operations. The company dominates the commercial launch industry with its partially reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets launched from Florida and California and those boosters do not share any common elements with the Starship.",
      "But Musk views the Super Heavy-Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, as the future of the company, with both stages designed to fly themselves to rocket-powered landings for rapid refurbishment and re-launch, a key element in the company's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "SpaceX is in the process of ramping up test flights to quickly verify performance, test new ideas, identify problem areas and implement fixes in downstream flights.",
      "How the FAA-mandated investigation might affect the test schedule is not yet known.",
      "\"A mishap investigation is designed to enhance public safety, determine the root cause of the event and identify corrective actions to avoid it from happening again,\" the FAA said.",
      "\"The FAA will be involved in every step of the SpaceX-led mishap investigation process and must approve SpaceX's final report, including any corrective actions. A return to flight is based on the FAA determining that any system, process  or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety.\"",
      "How long the investigation might take -- and when the Super Heavy-Starship might fly again -- is not yet known. But it almost certainly will stretch out SpaceX's test program.",
      "Going into Thursday's test flight, SpaceX said 2025 \"will be transformational for Starship with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",
      "Getting the Super Heavy-Starship flying on a regular basis is critical to NASA's Artemis moon program. NASA is paying SpaceX to develop a variant of the Starship upper stage to carry astronauts down to the lunar surface in 2027.",
      "To send a Starship to the moon, SpaceX must first launch it to low-Earth orbit where a succession of other Starship \"tankers\" will have to rendezvous, dock and autonomously refuel the moon-bound ship so it can blast out of Earth orbit and head for deep space.",
      "Astronauts launched by NASA's Space Launch System rocket then will rendezvous with the Starship in lunar orbit and then descend to the surface.",

Her relatives are involved to such an extent in local organizations, social clubs and volunteer groups, that, she said, taking a walk in nearby Altadena often means being waved down by someone who recognizes her mom.",
      "But the Eaton Fire upended those customs, and potentially put their future in jeopardy, when it erupted in Altadena on Jan. 7. Fueled by an extreme windstorm that sparked several wildfires at once in different parts of Los Angeles and its adjacent counties, the deadly blaze spread quickly over some 14,000 acres and left a trail of charred debris in its wake.",

      "Situated just north of Pasadena in the San Gabriel foothills, Altadena was long considered a haven for Black families who began settling there at the turn of the 20th century and continued trickling in as the years ensued. Some had escaped segregation in the South and took refuge in a place that did not subscribe to the racist criteria of the era for land ownership, an anomaly even in California.",

      "Richard-Craven said she never imagined witnessing such devastation in her lifetime. In the week after the fire broke out, she heard that mainstays in Altadena's network of Black-owned businesses \u2014 a barber shop, a book store, a nail salon \u2014 may have been burned, too.",
      "\"A bunch of Black-owned businesses burned, and those people are relying on that income,\" she said. \"They're relying on making money through other Black people, through customers.\"",

Tina McKinnor, a California State Assembly member, cited Altadena specifically at a news conference where she pledged to focus on policies that preserve the county's cultural cornerstones, in part by protecting residents from predators looking to take advantage of them in an emergency.",
      "\"I have spoken with many families, including a number of impacted families from the historically Black neighborhoods of Altadena. These Black families have been an important part of the history of L.A. County for generations,\" McKinnor said. \"This history is vital \u2014 a vital part of Los Angeles County's dynamic culture, and it's under attack by unscrupulous speculative land investors trying to take advantage of this natural disaster and its associated trauma for their own financial gain.\"",
      "Richard-Craven worries not everyone in Altadena will be able to fully recover, physically or financially, from the Eaton Fire, and those that do will continue to carry emotional scars. But the community's origin story and spirit give her hope that there is a path forward.",

      "Prologue",
      "On a hot afternoon in May 2016, five miles outside the young petro-city of Fort McMurray, Alberta, a small wildfire flickered and ventilated, rapidly expanding its territory through a mixed forest that hadn't seen fire in decades. This fire, farther off than the others, had started out doing what most human-caused wildfires do in their first hours of life: working its way tentatively from the point of ignition through grass, forest duff, and dead leaves\u2014a fire's equivalent to baby food. These fuels, in combination with the weather, would determine what kind of fire this one was going to be: a creeping, ground-level smolder doomed to smother in the heavy dew of a cool and windless spring night, or something bigger, more durable, and dynamic\u2014a fire that could turn night into day and day into night, that could, unchecked and all-consuming, bend the world to its will.",
      "It was early in the season for wildfires, but crews from the Wildfire Division of Alberta's Ministry of Forestry and Agriculture were on alert. As soon as smoke was spotted, wildland firefighters were dispatched, supported by a helicopter and water bombers. First responders were shocked by what they saw: by the time a helicopter with a water bucket got over it, the smoke was already black and seething, a sign of unusual intensity. Despite the firefighters' timely intervention, the fire grew from 4 acres to 150 in two hours. Wildfires usually settle down overnight, as the air cools and the dew falls, but by noon the following day this one had expanded to nearly 2,000 acres. Its rapid growth coincided with a rash of broken temperature records across the North American subarctic that peaked at 90\u00b0F on May 3 in a place where temperatures are typically in the 60s. On that day, Tuesday, a smoke- and wind-suppressing inversion lifted, winds whipped up to twenty knots, and a monster leaped across the Athabasca River.",
      "Within hours, Fort McMurray was overtaken by a regional apocalypse that drove serial firestorms through the city from end to end\u2014for days. Entire neighborhoods burned to their foundations beneath a towering pyrocumulus cloud typically found over erupting volcanoes. So huge and energetic was this fire-driven weather system that it generated hurricane-force winds and lightning that ignited still more fires many miles away. Nearly 100,000 people were forced to flee in what remains the largest, most rapid single-day evacuation in the history of modern fire. All afternoon, cell phones and dashcams captured citizens cursing, praying, and weeping as they tried to escape a suddenly annihilating world where fists of heat pounded on the windows, the sky rained fire, and the air came alive in roaring flame. Choices that day were stark and few: there was Now, and there was Never.",
      "A week later, the fire's toll conjured images of a nuclear blast: there was not just \"damage,\" there was total obliteration. Trying to articulate what she saw during a tour of the fire's aftermath, one official said, \"You go to a place where there was a house and what do you see on the ground? Nails. Piles and piles of nails.\" More than 2,500 homes and other structures were destroyed, and thousands more were damaged; 2,300 square miles of forest were burned. By the time the first photos were released, the fire had already belched 100 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, much of it from burning cars and houses. The Fort McMurray Fire, destined to become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history, continued to burn, not for days, but for months. It would not be declared fully extinguished until August of the following year.",
      "Wildfires live and die by the weather, but \"the weather\" doesn't mean the same thing it did in 1990, or even a decade ago, and the reason the Fort McMurray Fire trended on newsfeeds around the world in May 2016 was not only because of its terrifying size and ferocity, but also because it was a direct hit\u2014like Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans\u2014on the epicenter of Canada's multibillion-dollar petroleum industry. That industry and this fire represent supercharged expressions of two trends that have been marching in lockstep for the past century and a half. Together, they embody the spiraling synergy between the headlong rush to exploit hydrocarbons at all costs and the corresponding increase in heat-trapping greenhouse gases that is altering our atmosphere in real time. In the spring of 2016, halfway through the hottest year of the hottest decade in recorded history, a new kind of fire introduced itself to the world.",
      "\"No one's ever seen anything like this,\" Fort McMurray's exhausted and grieving fire chief said on national TV. \"The way this thing happened, the way it traveled, the way it behaved\u2014this is rewriting the book.\"",

      "Bestselling author Meryl Gordon's biography \"The Woman Who Knew Everyone: The Power of Perle Mesta, Washington's Most Famous Hostess\" (Grand Central Publishing), tells the story of the socialite, political savant, and United States envoy to Luxembourg, who turned her gift for hosting parties in the nation's capital into a unique form of activism, becoming one of the most famous women in America.",
      "Mesta's affinity for hosting politicians and celebrities would inspire a musical starring Ethel Merman, \"Call Me Madam,\" and a sobriquet that she was \"The Hostess with the Mostes' on the Ball.\"",

      "Perle visited overflowing orphanages populated by children whose parents died in the war. It made her heartsick. If there was ever a reason for a brighten-the-day party, this was it. On St. Nicholas Day, Perle hosted 350 war orphans, feeding them hot chocolate, sandwiches, and cookies. Perle imported a Paris puppet show and showered the children with dolls and toys. Describing her plans in a letter to Elise Morrow, Perle wrote, \"Of course, I will get more fun out of this than the children will.\"",
      "A photo of the party shows Perle raptly watching the puppet show with the children, a benign smile on her face, dolls covering her lap. Even though she was recovering from the flu, she gave a speech in mangled Luxembourgish. The giggling children, who responded in English, called her \"auntie.\" Perle acted out of emotion rather than calculation, but this gesture\u2014which she made into a yearly event\u2014 was a brilliant way to endear herself to Luxembourg citizens.",
      "One young boy stood out: the child of a wartime fling between a Black American serviceman and a local woman, who died shortly after giving birth. Perle was contacted by a Washington couple who had heard about the boy and wanted to adopt him but couldn't untangle the red tape. Concerned that six-year-old Frank would feel like an outcast in overwhelmingly white Luxembourg, Perle finessed the paperwork on behalf of Army lieutenant colonel Bert Cumby and his wife. Before the Black couple met Frank, they asked Perle for her frank opinion of the youngster. \"The cutest child you ever saw,\" she told them. \"And I'll say this to you. If you don't take the child, I will.\" Chance inspired Perle to take on the cause that became her most memorable innovation. Three off-duty American GIs showed up at the legation: one soldier bet the others a bottle of champagne they could meet the new minister without an official invitation. Perle not only greeted them but invited them to dinner that night with the legation's employees. \"Those three G.I.'s were the life of the party,\" she later wrote. \"One of them played the piano and another sang.\"",
      "After Marguerite mentioned that one soldier admitted to being homesick, Perle impulsively announced that she would hold an open house for American soldiers on the first Saturday of every month, starting on January 7, 1950. She chatted up the roughly thirty soldiers who attended the first weekend and then sent notes to their parents, telling them how much she enjoyed meeting their sons. As word spread, hundreds began to turn up from Germany and Belgium.",
      "\"I put as much thought and work into those parties as I do for a party for any senator,\" she told the Associated Press. \"The boys get their pay at the first of the month. They don't have much to do. This gives them some place to go. The boys get all they want to eat, plus milk, soft drinks and champagne if they want it.\"",
      "Paul Colbert, a serviceman from Somerville, Massachusetts, fondly remembered these parties. \"Perle would entertain as many as 1,200 of us at one time. She'd also write hundreds of letters home, telling our mothers she'd seen us and that we were looking fine. She's really a wonderful person, take it from me.\"",
      "A senator wrote to the State Department demanding to know who was financing this extravagance. It certainly wasn't the American taxpayer. Perle was underwriting it and finally had to rent a hall to accommodate the troops. She would later estimate that more than 25,000 GIs came to the Saturday night frolics. Perle delegated the details to Garner Camper, the butler she had brought over from Washington. Perle's niece Betty, then living in Luxembourg, recalled, \"He absolutely shone at these parties and all the GI's loved him. He served steaks and barbequed ribs, cheeseburgers, and hot dogs. Garner set up a soda fountain bar and he made them ice cream sundaes and milk shakes. Perle always got a lively local band to supply the music.\" In an era marked by bitter racial prejudice in America, Perle danced with any GI who asked, regardless of rank, ethnicity, or race.",
      "Hearst columnist Westbrook Pegler, a pugnacious right-winger who visited her in Luxembourg, wrote approvingly, \"Perle said she had danced with many GIs including Negroes, explaining that, although this had not been her custom in Oklahoma where she spent much of her girlhood, she thought she was representing all the people of the United States.\"",
      "* * * *",
      "In March 1950, Perle visited war-ravaged Germany. Newspapers ran a haunting photograph of her at a displaced persons' camp near Frankfurt hugging two Polish children. Children in the background looked hollow-eyed and lost, unable to meet her gaze.",
      "In Heidelberg, where Perle was the first senior American diplomat to visit the city since the end of World War II, she delivered a rousing feminist speech at a local university, offering the young women hope for careers and a life different from the ones their mothers had led. She claimed, disingenuously, that America had abolished the \"petticoat line,\" which she defined as a societal restriction \"which once kept America's women spending her day over a hot stove in a smoky kitchen while her husband basked in the sunshine of public life.\"",
      "In a bout of optimism, she declared, \"Unlike the members of her sex in some other lands, where women still plow the fields and carry heavy loads on their backs, the woman of America has achieved a place of her own in the public scene\u2014right alongside the man.\"",
      "Perle, at least, had done it, achieving her place in the public sphere whether the men in the American diplomatic corps liked it or not.",

    "summary": "The deal is expected to begin Sunday, with the exchange of several hostages held in Gaza for a number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's cabinet voted to approve a phased ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas, hours after the agreement was OK'd by the country's security cabinet on Friday. The first phase of the deal is expected to begin on Sunday, with the exchange of several hostages being held in Gaza for a number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.",
      "There would normally be a window for appeals of the decision be made to Israel's Supreme Court, but it has previously refrained from interfering in similar matters.",
      "According to a translated draft of the agreement viewed by CBS News, and from President Biden's description, the deal consists of three phases, each lasting 42 days.",
      "Hamas would start releasing hostages on the first day, initially returning three to Israel, according to the draft viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release four hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release three hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "It would release 33 women and children hostages in total during the first phase, as well as hostages over 50 years old, the draft viewed by CBS News said.",
      "President Biden said Wednesday that Americans will be among the hostages released in this phase, but he did not specify any names or how soon they would be freed.",
      "For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel is expected to release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operations in Gaza, and would begin reconstruction of the enclave's infrastructure, such as water, electricity and sewage systems.",
      "The second phase of the deal, which would be negotiated during the first, would involve the release of all remaining male Israeli hostages and the withdrawal of all IDF forces from Gaza, the president announced Wednesday.",
      "The third phase, which would be negotiated during earlier phases, would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners and the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, Mr. Biden said.",
      "The agreement marks a fragile step toward ending 15 months of war. There are believed to be about 100 hostages still being held after Hamas' brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed. The Israel Defense Forces has said it believes around a third of the hostages have already died.",
      "More than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israeli strikes since the war began, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, and most of Gaza's population is displaced and living in camps. Humanitarian groups have been struggling to deliver aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "Israeli airstrikes in Gaza continued overnight Friday, with the Hamas-run civil defense agency saying 113 Palestinians have been killed since a ceasefire and hostage deal was announced Wednesday evening local time.",
      "Huda Matrabie, a Palestinian woman in northern Gaza, told CBS News partner network BBC News that the prospect of the agreement had given her hope, but \"with this hope comes real fear\" that the deal could fall apart.",
      "\"The fear is not just of the immediate danger, but of the emotional toll: constant uncertainty and the ever-present feeling that our lives are not truly our own,\" she said.",
      "Families of the hostages gathered in Tel Aviv on Friday to call for the deal to be finalized.",
      "\"This deal comes too late for my son Guy, whose life will not be saved. But he can be brought back home for burial here,\" Michel Illouz, whose 26-year-old son was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023 and is believed to have died in Gaza, told a gathered crowd. \"Our work is not done. We will not rest until every hostage is home, the living and the dead. They all need to return to us, to their family.\"",

      "Footage from the Ring doorbell camera shows an idyllic lush setting framed by the security camera for roughly five seconds when suddenly something appears in the frame and crashes into what appears to be the home's walkway on the side of a stone entranceway.",

      "Herd - who is also curator of the university's meteorite collection\u00a0- arrived at the scene 10 days after the possible meteorite crash to document the origin of the fragments found by the homeowners. They picked up 7 grams of the rock from the grass next to the walkway and retrieved more samples using a vacuum and a magnet.

      "Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.'s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\"She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\" the family said. \"We are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",
      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" to William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice.\" She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's \"The Chairs,\" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles \"Major Barbara\" and \"Saint Joan.\"",
      "\"I've been very privileged to have such a life,\" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with\u00a0The Actor's Work. \"I mean it's magic and I still feel, when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain, the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me.\"",
      "The esteem in which Plowright was held in London was evident with the news that theaters across the West End will dim their lights for two minutes at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in her honor.",
      "Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England, her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school, she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.",
      "Following her London stage debut in 1954, Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men, such as John Osborne, who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new, rough-hewn, working-class actors like Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.",
      "Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" in 1956, starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.",
      "A year later, she co-starred with her future husband Olivier in the original London production of Osborne's \"The Entertainer.\" She played Olivier's daughter in the work and the two reunited for the 1960 film adaptation.",
      "By then, Plowright's marriage to British actor Roger Cage had ended, as had Olivier's 20-year union with Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961, while both were starring on Broadway, he in \"Becket\" and she in \"A Taste of Honey,\" for which she won a Tony.",
      "One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: \"I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you, or write to you \u2014 a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence, passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody.\"",
      "Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that, Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60, satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.",
      "She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of \"Surviving Picasso,\" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of \"101 Dalmatians\" in 1996 with Glenn Close.",
      "She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip \"Dennis the Menace,\" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire \"Last Action Hero\" in 1993.",
      "Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year, in 1993, when she won the supporting actress TV award for \"Stalin\" and the supporting actress movie award for \"Enchanted April.\" For the latter, which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy, she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.",
      "Not all her works were career roses, as with the disastrous \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy \"Goose on the Loose\" didn't rouse critics.",
      "A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame \u2014 bestowing awards, defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.",
      "\"That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him,\" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. \"When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes, then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight.\"",

Israeli media reports suggested the delay was likely down to Netanyahu trying to buy time to deal with nationalist hardliners in his cabinet who've always fiercely opposed any agreement with Hamas.",
      "\"We fully expect the deal to proceed as described yesterday, and on the timeline that we've laid out, so implementation beginning as soon as Sunday with a ceasefire and the release of the first hostages,\" U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor Jonathan Finer said Thursday on \"CBS Mornings,\" acknowledging \"a set of implementation details and conditions that are going to be a challenge throughout the implementation of this deal, which is going to extend well into the next administration.\"",
      "Finer said President Biden had spoken with Netanyahu \"twice in the last few days, including yesterday after the agreement was reached in Doha.\"",
      "The deal is a fragile one, and the logistics of it will be extremely complex \u2014 even Hamas getting the hostages safely to a handover point will present significant security challenges.",
      "The agreement is not set to take effect until Sunday, and with Israel's military increasing attacks in Gaza rather than easing them in the wake of the deal \u2014 and none of the roughly 100 hostages expected to come home for several days \u2014 nobody who spoke with CBS News on either side of the border seemed ready to take for granted the peace looming tantalizingly just over the horizon.",
      "In Gaza, \"a new chance to live\"",
      "For Gazans, it was the best possible news. Hearing that the relentless bombing of their towns and villages would stop on Sunday brought overwhelming relief and joy.",
      "One little boy who spoke to CBS News' team in the enclave summed it up in three words: \"We're going home!\"",
      "Mahmood Kurdia, who's been living in the southern city of Khan Younis after being forced from his home in northern Gaza, said he couldn't wait to get back, even though he knows he has virtually nothing to go back to.",
      "\"I want to go back home to see my family, my neighbors and my home. Even though my home is just ruins now, but I still want to see it. I want to remove the rubble and put my tent on the top of the ruins and say to Israel that I'm back,\" he told CBS News on Wednesday.\"",
      "Like everyone else, however, he was keenly aware that peace, if it is coming, is still three days away.",
      "Israel appeared to ramp up its strikes Wednesday evening, killing more than 70 people between the ceasefire deal being announced and Thursday morning, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health and the enclave's Civil Defense rescue agency. Both agencies told CBS News that the dead including 21 children and 24 women.",
      "Still, Kurdia couldn't help cling to hope.",
      "\"This news means a new chance to live,\" he said. \"This means a new chance for us to live and watch our children live, grow and get education. It is just a new hope for survival. This is the ceasefire deal we hope to get.\"",
      "Israeli hostage's cousin happy \u2014 but \"not breathing\"",
      "In Tel Aviv, a small crowd gathered Wednesday night on the spot where protesters have, week after week, demanded that Israel's government bring the remaining hostages home.",
      "Yifat Kalderon was among them. Her cousin Ofer was among the 251 people kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that saw militants kill some 1,200 people, and which sparked the war that has raged for almost 480 days.",
      "Ofer was among the dozens of people kidnapped by the gunmen who stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz. Over the age of 50, he should be among the hostages released by Hamas in the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire agreement.",
      "But asked if she felt a huge relief on Wednesday night, Kalderon made it clear that emotion would have to wait.",
      "\"No,\" she said. \"I'm going to feel a huge relief when it's going to be done. When are we going to get all the 90-98 hostages alive and the dead ones back home.\"",
      "With bombs still falling in Gaza and little to indicate any new level of trust between Israel and Hamas, hostages' families all across Israel were left to keep waiting, and worrying about everything that could still go wrong.",
      "\"I'm not saying that I'm not happy,\" Kalderon said. \"But I'm trying to, you know, take care of myself, not to be, you know, I don't want to - I want to see them, first of all. Until I'm going to see them crossing the border\u2026 I'm not going to believe anything.\"",

      "Russia on Friday sentenced three lawyers who had defended Alexey Navalny to several years in prison for bringing messages from the late opposition leader from prison to the outside world.",
      "The sentences come in the midst of a massive crackdown during Moscow's Ukraine offensive and as Russia seeks to punish Navalny's associates, even after his unexplained death in an Arctic prison colony last February.",
      "Vadim Kobzev, Alexey Liptser and Igor Sergunin were found guilty of participating in an \"extremist organization\" by a court in the town of Petushki.",
      "Kobzev, the most high-profile member of Navalny's legal team, was given a five-and-a-half year sentence, while Liptser was handed five years and Sergunin three-and-a-half years.",
      "Navalny's exiled widow,\u00a0Yulia Navalnaya, said the lawyers are \"political prisoners and should be freed immediately\".",
      "They were almost the only people visiting Navalny in prison while he served his 19-year sentence.",
      "Navalny, Putin's main political opponent, communicated with the world by transmitting messages through his lawyers that his team then published on social media. Passing letters and messages through lawyers is a normal practice in Russian prisons.",
      "The men were sentenced after a closed-door trial the town about 72 miles east of Moscow, near the Pokrov prison where Navalny was held before he was moved to a remote colony above the Arctic Circle, where he died.",
      "\"We are on trial for passing Navalny's thoughts to other people,\" Kobzev said in court last week.",
      "The court said the men had \"used their status as lawyers while visiting convict Navalny ... to ensure the regular transfer of information between the members of the extremist community, including those wanted and hiding outside the Russian Federation, and Navalny.\"",
      "It said that enabled Navalny to continue \"planning the preparation and creating conditions for committing crimes with an extremist character.\"",
      "Navalny had condemned the arrests of the lawyers in October 2023 as \"outrageous\" and part of a campaign to further isolate him in jail.",
      "The verdicts come several days before four independent journalists accused of helping Navalny will be back in court, facing up to six years in prison.",
      "They also come four years after Navalny defiantly returned to Russia - on Jan. 17, 2021 - after recovering from a poison attack that almost killed him.",
      "In his messages to the outside world, Navalny denounced the Kremlin's Ukraine offensive as \"criminal\" and told supporters \"not to give up.\"",
      "Just last week, Kobzev compared Moscow's current crackdown on dissent to Stalin-era mass repression.",
      "\"Eight years have passed ... and in the Petushki court, people are once again on trial for discrediting officials and the state agencies,\" he said in a speech published by the Novaya Gazeta newspaper.",
      "While Russia has increasingly jailed its citizens for dissent against the Kremlin, cases against lawyers defending those people are still rare.",
      "The UIA International Lawyers Association has warned that the trial raises questions about the future of the profession in Russia.",
      "\"Defending a client, regardless of their political views or actions, is a cornerstone of the rule of law and a universal principle enshrined in international legal standards,\" the organization said last month.",
      "It said the trial \"sets a dangerous precedent\" in \"potentially deterring\" lawyers from defending clients in sensitive cases.",
      "International rights groups and some Western countries slammed the sentencing.",
      "\"Today marks yet another low point in the already dire human rights situation in the Russian Federation,\" Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said on social media Friday.",
      "Navalny's team has accused prison authorities of secretly filming Navalny's meetings - meant to be confidential - with his lawyers and publishing obtained footage on social media.",
      "Last week, Navalnaya said Russia refused to remove her late husband from its list of terrorists and extremists.",
      "She published a December letter from Russia's financial watchdog Rosfinmonitoring addressed to Navalny's mother that said the late opposition leader was still being investigated for money laundering and \"financing terrorism.\"",

      "London - Britain's Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced Thursday that there would be a number of new central government-backed local inquiries into years-old allegations of child grooming gangs, weeks after Elon Musk accused British Prime Minister Keir Starmer of failings in relation to the handling of the crimes in a series of tweets. The crimes took place a decade ago when Starmer was the country's top prosecutor.",
      "Musk's tweets\u00a0targeted Starmer personally, suggesting he should be in jail and that \"America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government,\" thrusting the crimes back into the political conversation in Britain.",
      "Starmer defended his record and denounced the criticism as politically motivated.",
      "\"Those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible, they're not interested in victims. They're interested in themselves,\" Starmer told reporters after Musk's tweets earlier this month, not mentioning the tech mogul and close associate of Donald Trump by name.",
      "In 2012, a newspaper report on the grooming led to a major government inquiry, which two years later found that at least 1,400 children had been subjected to sexual exploitation in Rotherham, northern England, between 1997 and 2013. Similar exploitation was discovered in other towns, leading to a national inquiry.",
      "The prosecution service, which was led by Starmer between 2008 and 2013, was criticized in the report for not pursuing charges in Rochdale because it viewed a victim as \"unreliable\" following an investigation between 2008 and 2009. That decision was later overturned by a Starmer appointee.",
      "\"Mr. Starmer has striven to improve the treatment of victims of sexual assault within the criminal justice system throughout his term as Director of Public Prosecution,\" a 2013 report from the Home Affairs Committee said.",

We changed, or I changed, the whole prosecution approach, because I wanted to challenge, and did challenge, the myths and stereotypes that were stopping those victims being heard,\" Starmer said. \"When I left office, we had the highest number of child sexual abuse cases being prosecuted on record.\"",

    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

      "French Appeal Court prosecutors said an American man accused of sexually assaulting a Pennsylvania college student in 2013 and later sending her a Facebook message that said, \"So I raped you,\" was being extradited Thursday to the United States.",
      "The Appeal Court prosecutors' office in Metz, in northeastern France, said Ian Cleary was handed over to U.S. authorities at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.",
      "Cleary, 31, of Saratoga, California, was detained in April in Metz after a three-year search. He has been held in custody pending extradition proceedings since his arrest. The Appeal Court in Metz ruled in July that he could be extradited.",
      "Cleary had been the subject of an international search since authorities in Pennsylvania issued a 2021 felony warrant in the case weeks after an Associated Press story detailed the reluctance of local prosecutors to pursue campus sex crimes.",
      "The arrest warrant accuses Cleary of stalking an 18-year-old Gettysburg College student at a party in 2013, sneaking into her dorm and sexually assaulting her while she texted friends for help. He was a 20-year-old Gettysburg student at the time, but didn't return to campus.",
      "The accuser, Shannon Keeler, had a rape exam done the same day. She gathered witnesses and evidence and spent years urging officials to file charges. She went to authorities again in 2021 after discovering the Facebook messages that seemed to come from Cleary's account.",

    "title": "Scientists make \"jaw-dropping\" discovery about Iron Age women in U.K.",
    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists analyzing 2,000-year-old DNA have revealed that a Celtic society in the southern U.K. during the Iron Age was centered around women, a study said.",
    "story": [
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \"it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood,\" said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2014 called matrilocality \u2014 is historically rare.",
      "\"Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines,\" the authors write in an article accompanying the study.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2014 women leaving their homes to join their husband's family group \u2014 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives' extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain's Celtic society \"more egalitarian than the Roman world,\" said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",
      "\"When the Romans arrived, they were astonished to find women occupying positions of power,\"\u00a0 Russell said.",
      "Some had doubted these accounts, suggesting \"that the Romans exaggerated the liberties of British women to paint a picture of an untamed society,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"But archaeology, and now genetics, implies women were influential in many spheres of Iron Age life,\" he said.",
      "\"Indeed, it is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "\"What makes these scams particularly dangerous is their multilayered approach,\" Marva Bailer, AI expert and founder and CEO of Qualaix, told Fox News Digital. \"Scammers build trust over time, often pretending to be a family member, a staff member or even someone close to the celebrity who claims they are helping the celebrity by managing their charitable efforts. This indirect approach makes the scam seem more credible, as it\u2019s not the celebrity asking for help directly, it's someone positioned to be more relatable or \u2018realistic.\u2019 It plays on the idea that the celebrity is too proud or private to ask for help themselves, which makes the situation seem more genuine.\"",

Anne sent most of her divorce settlement to the fake Pitt.",

      "Almost half of all U.S. adults have elevated blood pressure (systolic pressure between 120 and 19 and diastolic pressure less than 80). High blood pressure (hypertension, which is when the systolic pressure is between 130 and 139 or diastolic pressure is between 80 and 89) can raise the risk of heart attack and stroke if left untreated, per the AHA.",

      "People who rested their arms on their laps drove up the top number in the blood pressure reading (systolic pressure) by nearly 4 mmHg, while leaving their arm hanging at their side increased it by nearly 7 mmHg.",
      "For the most accurate results, the guidelines are to rest the arm on a desk or another firm surface at the same level as the heart, Serwer told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The proper position is to sit upright with your feet on the floor and your legs uncrossed, resting your arm on a flat surface that is level with your heart,\" Serwer advised.",
      "Certain arm positions can lead to inflated results and misdiagnoses of hypertension, research has shown. (iStock)",
      "If the cuff is too large or small, measurements will be abnormal, the cardiologist cautioned.",
      "\"Most blood pressure monitors use either an arm cuff or a wrist cuff,\" he said. \"Arm cuffs tend to be more accurate and require fewer steps to ensure accuracy.\"",
      "Serwer said he typically asks all patients to bring their home cuff to the office, where he first measures their blood pressure manually and then uses the patient\u2019s cuff.",
      "\"We can then assess the accuracy of their cuff,\" he said.",
      "The most accurate results are obtained after sitting in a low-stress environment for five minutes, Serwer noted.",
      "\"Know your blood pressure, even if you are healthy.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:06:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Steve Milloy, a former Trump administration EPA official, said that Congress needs to remake the law in order for the new methane emissions rule to be reversed.",

      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is leading 22 other attorneys general in suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over a new rule that would fine the oil and natural gas sector for methane emissions that exceed a certain level.",
      "The GOP states are alleging the new rule, which was established in President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, is \"arbitrary, capricious, [and] an abuse of discretion.\" The complaint against the EPA is scant on details, other than asserting the new rule is \"unlawful\" because \"the final rule exceeds the agency\u2019s statutory authority.\"",
      "While the Supreme Court has articulated a very narrow authority on how Congress can delegate its legislative power, Steve Milloy, former Trump administration EPA transition adviser and senior fellow at the Energy and Environmental Legal Institute, said it is unclear to him how the EPA's rule circumvents Congress.",

      "Flames rise up from a flaring pit near a well in the Bakken Oil Field. One of the primary components of natural gas is methane, which is odorless when it comes directly out of the gas well.",
      "\"The IRA clearly says EPA is to levy a tax and prescribes the tax rate,\" Milloy told Fox News Digital, pointing to the section of the IRA's \"Waste Emissions Charge\" that sets a threshold for methane emissions at 25,000 metric tons. \"I will be interested to see how the states support their claims.\"",
      "Nonetheless, Milloy is against the new fee on the oil and gas sector, noting methane is an \"irrelevant greenhouse gas.\"",
      "\"The tax is pointless and will accomplish nothing except to make oil and natural gas more expensive,\" he said.",
      "Milloy suggested the move to sue in the final days of the Biden administration is to start the process for the plaintiffs to settle with the Trump administration. According to him, this is a tactic that has been used by both sides of the green energy debate. He added that in the past, the Trump administration has sought to get rid of \"sue and settle\" tactics.",
      "\"Congress needs to change the law,\" Milloy said. \"Because, let's say that they sue and settle, well, the next administration can come back and undo it.\"",
      "President-elect Trump, left, and President Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, another forthcoming lawsuit from the Michigan Oil and Gas Association (MOGA) and the American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce\u00a0(AMFree) has also asserted that the new rule circumvents Congress, but provided details explaining why.",
      "NEW NYC \u2018CHAR BROIL\u2019 RULE WOULD FORCE RESTAURANTS TO CUT EMISSIONS BY 75%",
      "\"Under Subpart W, facilities in the natural gas and petroleum supply chains must report greenhouse gas emissions if they emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon-dioxide-equivalent emissions each year,\" the second lawsuit explains. \"For gases other than carbon dioxide, \u2018equivalent\u2019 emissions are determined by multiplying emissions by the gas\u2019s \u2018global warming potential\u2019 ('GWP').\"",
      "Michael Buschbacher, a partner at Boyden Gray PLLC, which is representing MOGA and AmFree in their lawsuit, agreed with Milloy that it will take legislation to reverse the new methane rule, but said the purpose of their legal filings is \"to get the most onerous mandates off the books, so the American energy industry can begin its march back to dominance under the new administration.\"",

Schmidt College of Science, conducted an innovative study that combined haptic feedback, electromyogram control and a wearable soft robotic armband. This study aimed to investigate whether users could control grip forces applied to two different objects simultaneously with a dexterous artificial hand.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The study's findings, published in Scientific Reports, demonstrated that multiple channels of haptic feedback allowed participants to successfully grasp and transport two objects at once without dropping them, even when visual feedback was obstructed.",

This armband included soft actuators that provided proportional contact force feedback and vibrotactile stimulators that alerted users if they were about to drop or break an object. The armband's design allowed it to deliver haptic feedback at three critical points corresponding to the thumb, index and little fingers, effectively enhancing the user's ability to control multiple objects simultaneously.",

      "Apple\u2019s Macs are generally considered more secure than Windows PCs, but they are not immune to hackers. Numerous incidents demonstrate that Macs are not impenetrable, and a new one has recently been added to the list. Security researchers have discovered a new variant of stealer malware that targets browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets and other personal data. I\u00a0reported on this malware in 2024 as well. Previously, it relied on macOS browser extensions to steal data. Now, it uses phishing websites and fake GitHub repositories to target Macs, which have a user base of 100 million people.",

      "The evolution of info-stealer Mac malware",
      "Cybersecurity company\u00a0Check Point has discovered a new variant of info-stealer malware, BanShee. Elastic Security Labs first highlighted this malware in mid-2024, noting that it operates as malware-as-a-service, a business model in which cybercriminals provide access to malicious software and related infrastructure for a fee. At that time, it was available for as much as $3,000 per month.",
      "Check Point says this malware evolved in September after being exposed. This time, its developers had \"stolen\" a string encryption algorithm from Apple\u2019s own XProtect antivirus engine, which replaced the plain text strings used in the original version. Since antivirus programs expect to see this kind of encryption from Apple\u2019s legitimate security tools, they weren\u2019t flagged as suspicious, allowing the BanShee to remain undetected and quietly steal data from targeted devices.",

      "4.3 MILLION AMERICANS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA BREACH",
      "How the Mac malware operates",
      "BanShee Stealer is a prime example of how advanced malware has become. Once it\u2019s on a system, it gets straight to work stealing all kinds of sensitive information. It goes after data from browsers like Chrome, Brave, Edge and Vivaldi, as well as cryptocurrency wallet extensions. It even takes advantage of two-factor authentication (2FA) extensions to grab credentials. On top of that, it collects details about the device\u2019s software and hardware, as well as the external IP address.",
      "The Mac malware also tricks users with fake pop-ups that look like real system prompts, tricking victims into entering their macOS passwords. Once it has gathered the stolen information, BanShee exfiltrates it to command-and-control servers, using encrypted and encoded files to ensure the data remains secure.",
      "The malware\u2019s creators used GitHub repositories to spread BanShee. They set up fake repositories that looked like they hosted popular software, complete with stars and reviews, to seem trustworthy. These campaigns didn\u2019t just target macOS users with BanShee. They also hit Windows users with a different\u00a0malware called Lumma Stealer. Over three waves, the attackers used these fake repositories to trick people into downloading their malicious files.",

      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links. Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3)\u00a0Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4)\u00a0Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5)\u00a0Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "No device is immune to cyberattacks when a human operator is involved. Take the BanShee Stealer, for example. It managed to target Macs not due to weak cybersecurity measures by Apple but because it successfully tricked users into installing it and granting the required permissions. Most breaches, hacks and other cyberattacks stem from human error. This highlights the importance of maintaining basic cybersecurity hygiene. It's crucial to know what you\u2019re downloading, ensure it\u2019s from a trusted source and carefully review the permissions you grant to any online service or application.",

      "13) Try out the new Passwords app",
      "I always stress the importance of using a password manager to store your passwords. Let\u2019s be honest, we all have a ton of apps and services that require an account and password. If you use the same password everywhere, you risk having your important info stolen by cybercriminals. But it\u2019s also impossible to come up with a unique password for every app and remember them all.",
      "Password managers make life easier by storing your passwords and filling them in when you log into apps. But they usually charge a monthly or yearly fee. That\u2019s where Apple\u2019s Passwords app comes in. It works just like a password manager but without the extra cost. Open the app from the App Library, and it\u2019ll keep your login details encrypted and synced across all your devices.",
      "While Apple's new Passwords app in iOS 18 offers a convenient and cost-free solution for password management, it's important to consider its limitations. These include its exclusivity to the Apple ecosystem, lack of compatibility with Android or Linux devices and limited functionality outside of Safari and Apple apps. For those seeking a more comprehensive password management solution that works across various browsers and apps, check out my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "14) Use ChatGPT and writing tools",
      "Apple introduced Apple Intelligence for iPhone 15 Pro and newer models running iOS 18.2, bringing a range of AI tools and ChatGPT support. ChatGPT is now built into various parts of iOS, and if you have an iPhone 15 Pro or above, you can take full advantage of this integration.",
      "You can use Apple's enhanced Writing Tools to access ChatGPT directly in apps like Notes, Mail and any other text input field.

Start by updating to iOS 18.2 or later to access the latest features. Next, security measures like a passcode or biometric authentication should be set up for added protection.

The company is planning to cut capacity at five factories, reducing production by about 700,000 vehicles, while also laying off more than 35,000 workers in its home country. Now, reports suggest the company had a massive data leak at its subsidiary software company Cariad, which exposed personal data, including geolocation data, of around 800,000 EV owners online and accessible for months. Such information could be valuable to criminals for extortion purposes. What's interesting is that a hacker association informed the company about this data leak after receiving a tip from an anonymous hacker.",

      "What you need to know about the data leak",
      "As reported by Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine, Volkswagen is facing a major data security issue after movement data from 800,000 electric cars and the personal contact information of their owners were left exposed on the internet. This data revealed sensitive details, such as the precise locations where cars were parked, including private locations like people\u2019s homes, government buildings and even questionable spots like brothels.",
      "The exposed data includes detailed movement patterns of these vehicles, allowing for the creation of comprehensive profiles of individuals' daily activities. This could be particularly concerning for public figures or anyone with privacy concerns.",
      "Several car brands under the Volkswagen group, including VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda, were affected by the breach, which exposed sensitive data across multiple countries. The information was stored on Amazon cloud servers without adequate protection, leaving it vulnerable for months before the issue was discovered.",
      "For around 466,000 of the 800,000 affected vehicles, the location data was detailed enough to map out drivers\u2019 daily routines. Spiegel reported that the list of affected users included German politicians, business leaders, the entire EV fleet used by Hamburg police and even suspected intelligence agents.",
      "The breach came to light when an anonymous hacker tipped off the Chaos Computer Club. While Volkswagen left the data easily accessible during this time, there is no indication so far that anyone misused or accessed it maliciously.",

      "How can this data leak affect you?",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is more than just a tech issue. It is a real concern for anyone who values their privacy. With precise location data out in the open, someone could figure out where you live, work or spend your free time. This information could be misused in many ways, from targeted scams where hackers pretend to be Volkswagen or its partners to trick you into giving up sensitive information, to more personal threats like stalking or harassment.",
      "Imagine someone knowing your daily routine or identifying places you visit that you would prefer to keep private. Visits to clinics, legal offices or other sensitive locations could expose you to embarrassment or blackmail.",
      "The breach also raises concerns for business leaders, government officials and military personnel as their movements linked to high-security or restricted areas could be exposed, increasing the risk of corporate espionage or national security threats. Moreover, when paired with other vulnerabilities, such as app credentials, hackers could potentially exploit the data to unlock or even control vehicles remotely.",

      "In light of the recent Volkswagen data breach, it is crucial to take proactive measures to safeguard your personal data. Here are 6 ways you can stay safe after this leak:",
      "1) Check your app settings:\u00a0Review the permissions and data-sharing settings in your car's companion app. Disable features that track or share your location if they are not essential for your use. Regularly update the app to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "2) Be alert to scams:\u00a0Keep an eye out for suspicious emails, messages or calls pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. Avoid clicking on links or sharing sensitive information without verifying the sender.",
      "3) Consider data opt-out options:\u00a0Many vehicles with online features allow you to limit or disable certain data-sharing functionalities. Check your car\u2019s settings to reduce the amount of personal data being collected.",
      "4) Strengthen your online accounts:\u00a0If you use the same email or password across multiple accounts, update them immediately. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "5) Beware of snail mail scams: While most people focus on digital threats, physical mail scams can also follow a data breach like this. If your contact information was exposed, you might receive fraudulent letters pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. These could ask for payments, personal details or even encourage you to visit fake websites.",
      "6) Install strong antivirus software: Ensure that you have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices, especially those connected to your vehicle or its apps. This can help protect you from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "30% OF AMERICANS OVER 65 WANT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE WEB. HERE\u2019S WHY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is a glaring example of how companies need to take user data security more seriously. Exposing personal details and precise locations is not just a technical mistake. It is a massive breach of trust. While VW has patched the issue, the damage shows how important it is for businesses to be more responsible with the data they collect. People deserve to know their information is safe and used only when necessary. If companies cannot protect their customers\u2019 privacy, they risk losing their confidence altogether. It is time for the industry to step up and do better.",

The first two versions of the Starship were powered by diesel engines, achieving notable fuel efficiencies compared to industry standards. However, the introduction of the Cummins X15N natural gas engine in the Starship 3.0 represents a pivotal shift away from diesel, addressing both environmental concerns and operational efficiency.",
      "The X15N engine, launched in 2024, is designed specifically for heavy-duty applications and overcomes previous limitations associated with natural gas as a fuel source.

This adaptability not only enhances its eco-friendliness but also positions it as a practical option for fleets looking to transition away from traditional fuels.",
      "Weight reduction: The new engine is approximately 500 pounds lighter than its diesel counterpart, which increases the potential freight-carrying capacity of the truck. This weight reduction is complemented by other lightweight materials used in the truck's construction, contributing to an impressive ton-miles per gallon efficiency of 183, compared to an industry average of 72.",
      "Aerodynamic design: The Starship 3.0 features a sleek design with curved edges and optimized aerodynamics that reduce wind resistance. Additional enhancements like low rolling resistance tires and integrated aerodynamic panels further contribute to its efficiency.",
      "Advanced lubricants: Shell has developed specialized lubricants tailored for the higher temperatures generated by natural gas engines. The truck uses Shell Rotella NG Plus SAE 5W-30 synthetic oil, formulated specifically for this purpose, alongside advanced transmission lubricants that improve overall performance.",
      "Real-world testing: The input from experienced truck drivers, such as brothers Brian and Eric Rector, has been invaluable in refining the Starship's design and functionality. Their hands-on experience with all three iterations of the truck has provided critical data that informs ongoing improvements.",

    "summary": "PowerSchool, which serves over 60 million students and teachers globally, has become the latest target of cybercriminals. Millions of records were stolen.",
    "story": [
      "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard.",
      "Cybercriminals spare no industry, targeting sectors like health care, insurance, automotive and education. Health care has been a frequent target, with attacks like the Ascension breach last year and the CVR incident in late 2024.",
      "Now, education technology giant PowerSchool has become the latest target, with records of millions of students and teachers stolen.",
      "While the exact number of affected individuals remains unknown, the scale of the breach is alarming.",
      "PowerSchool serves 18,000 customers worldwide, including schools in the U.S. and Canada, managing grading, attendance and personal information for over 60 million K-12 students and teachers.",

      "Kids working on their laptops\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How did hackers target PowerSchool",
      "PowerSchool revealed a cybersecurity breach to its customers Jan. 7, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. The company said it discovered the breach Dec. 28, after customer data from its PowerSchool SIS platform was stolen through the PowerSource support portal.",
      "PowerSchool SIS is a student information system used for managing grades, attendance, enrollment and other student records. Hackers accessed the PowerSource portal using stolen credentials and used an \"export data manager\" tool to steal information.",
      "The company said this wasn\u2019t a ransomware attack or a result of software flaws, but rather a straightforward network break-in. The company has hired a third-party cybersecurity firm to investigate the breach, figure out what happened and determine who was affected.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "UNDERSTANDING BRUSHING SCAMS AND HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "What data got stolen",
      "The PowerSource portal includes a feature that allows PowerSchool engineers to access customer systems for support and troubleshooting. The attacker exploited this feature to export the PowerSchool SIS \"students\" and \"teachers\" database tables to a CSV file, which was then stolen.",
      "PowerSchool confirmed the stolen data primarily includes contact details like names and addresses. However, for some districts, the data may also include sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, personally identifiable information, medical records and grades.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The company said customer support tickets, credentials and forum data were not accessed or stolen during the breach. PowerSchool also emphasized that not all SIS customers were affected and expects only a subset of customers will need to notify those affected.",
      "\"We do not anticipate the data being shared or made public, and we believe it has been deleted without any further replication or dissemination,\" the developer told customers in a notice.",
      "\"We have also deactivated the compromised credential and restricted all access to the affected portal. Lastly, we have conducted a full password reset and further tightened password and access control for all PowerSource customer support portal accounts.\"",
      "PowerSchool said affected adults will be offered free credit monitoring, while minors will receive subscriptions to an unspecified identity protection service.",

      "5 ways you can stay safe from PowerSchool data breach",
      "The PowerSchool data breach has highlighted the importance of staying vigilant about your personal information. Here are five steps you can take to protect yourself:",
      "1. Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and any online services linked to your personal information. Watch for unauthorized transactions or changes to your accounts that could signal misuse of your data.",
      "2. Freeze your credit: If your Social Security number or other sensitive details were compromised, consider placing a credit freeze with major credit bureaus like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This prevents potential identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name.",
      "3. Use identity theft protection services:\u00a0Take advantage of any identity protection services offered by PowerSchool as part of its breach response. These services can alert you to suspicious activity and provide support if your identity is stolen.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One of the best parts of some identity protection services is that they have identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Wherever possible, enable\u00a02FA for your online accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text code or app-generated token, to access your accounts.",
      "5. Be aware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software: Cybercriminals often use phishing scams to exploit data breaches. Avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or text messages, especially those claiming to be from PowerSchool or your school district.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You can blame hackers for this breach, but PowerSchool shares the responsibility for failing to adequately protect sensitive data. The company may also be in violation of data privacy agreements it signed with school districts, as well as federal and state laws designed to safeguard student privacy. What\u2019s more concerning is that PowerSchool took nearly two weeks to notify its customers about the breach. Schools are now left scrambling to assess the full extent of the intrusion. This delay is not just irresponsible; it puts students, parents and teachers at heightened risk of cyberattacks and identity theft.",

      "The director of a homeless shelter where A.V. stayed in January 2022 told the child welfare agency that she appeared to have untreated paranoia, dissociative behaviors and PTSD, according to the lawsuit. The state began investigating and eventually spoke to the woman\u2019s counselor, midwife and a hospital social worker without her knowledge, even though it had no jurisdiction over fetuses.",
      "The woman remained unaware of the probe until she gave birth and her daughter was immediately taken away, according to ACLU senior staff attorney Harrison Stark.",
      "A.V. had no knowledge that hospital officials were giving updates to the state while she was in labor, including details of her cervix dilation, and that she had lost temporary custody of her baby. The state even sought a court order forcing the woman to undergo a cesarean section, although it was rendered moot because she agreed to the surgery.",
      "The woman was not able to win full custody of her child until seven months later.",
      "\"It\u2019s a horrific set of circumstances for our client,\" Stark said. \"It\u2019s also clear from what has happened that this is not the first time the agency has done this. We have learned from several confidential sources that DCF has a pattern and practice of looking into folks like our client who are pregnant, who are of interest to the agency based on a set of unofficial criteria and who the agency is tracking on what is called a 'high risk pregnancy docket' or 'high risk pregnancy calendar.'\"",
      "Department for Children and Families commissioner Chris Winter said the agency will not comment until officials have reviewed the lawsuit and investigated its accusations.",

This is an opportunity for Vermont to signal to other states, as a leader, and say that these rights don\u2019t just exist on paper. They exist in practice, too.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 08:00:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Massachusetts&apos; overcrowded shelter system has allowed immigrants to enter without vetting and keep taxpayers out in the cold, a former director says.",
    "story": [
      "Jon Fetherston, who managed a migrant shelter in Massachusetts between November 2023 to July 2024, described the chaos he witnessed and decried the state's emergency shelter program.",
      "A former migrant shelter director in Massachusetts described the chaos he saw under the state's right-to-shelter laws, saying that the influx of illegal immigrants has clogged the state's infrastructure and that there is virtually no vetting for the surge of border crossers.",
      "Massachusetts spent nearly $1.1 billion of taxpayers' money this fiscal year to house and feed migrants streaming into the state, often in hotels that have been converted to shelters. However, taxpayers have at times found themselves boxed out of shelters as immigrants have crowded the system and taken priority, said Jon Fetherston, who acted as a migrant shelter director at the Marlborough Holiday Inn between November 2023 and July of last year.",
      "Under its right-to-shelter law, established in 1983, the state must provide housing for displaced families and pregnant women. In 2023, the state's shelters reached their capacity of 7,500 enrolled families \u2013 yet migrants continue to use Massachusetts' programs.",
      "Fetherston previously detailed the repeated violent incidents and mistreatment of children he saw during his tenure \u2013 and decried a lack of consequences for their perpetrators.",
      "CHILD RAPE AND VIOLENT INCIDENTS REPORTED AT MASSACHUSETTS MIGRANT SHELTERS, FORMER FACILITY DIRECTOR SAYS",
      "Illegal immigrants line the floors of a terminal at Boston Logan Airport as Massachusetts' shelters are overrun. (WBZ)",
      "In light of a man from the Dominican Republic, who was accused of possessing an AR-15 and $1 million worth of fentanyl in a state-subsidized room last month in Revere, Fetherston explained the vetting process \u2013\u00a0or lack thereof \u2013\u00a0in an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "Leonardo Andujar Sanchez, 28, was arrested on Dec. 27 after his girlfriend called Revere police to report that he had drugs and a long, black gun hidden under a pink suitcase in their hotel room. The woman told police that she had been living at the Quality Inn for three months and that she and Sanchez had obtained the room through a refugee program.",
      "\"I worked in that shelter for a very limited time,\" Fetherston told Fox News Digital. \"You can't hide an AR-15 in that room. You cannot hide drugs in that room. The rooms are not big\u2026 the case manager there should have been standing up\u2026 there should have been red flags\u2026 to say 'Hey, listen, this guy's not attending those meetings. This guy is blowing off housekeeping.'\"",

      "Fetherston said that the incident was just another example of a lack of security and vetting at the state's strained migrant facilities.",
      "The Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, which oversees the state's shelter program, told Fox News Digital that it has security guards at every facility and conducts warrant checks every 30 days. However, Fetherston did not see that activity during his tenure.",
      "\"I will tell you that all the shelters that I've either worked in and volunteered [at] do have a form of security. But\u2026 it's really basically somebody sitting at the desk \u2013\u00a0no better than you would have in a corporate office park\u2026 it's certainly not the level of security that you need in these shelters\u2026 I never saw anybody come in and do a warrant check.\"",

      "\"You hire people just because they can speak the language that you need, being either Haitian or, you know, Portuguese or Spanish. So you're not necessarily hiring a qualified caseworker or mental health advocate or somebody who's been experienced in navigating these things, because those people don't exist,\" he said.",
      "\"A lot of times\u2026 the case managers became sympathetic to their fellow countrymen when they taught them how to navigate the system and not always in the most ethical ways. And that's where the chaos came down.\"",
      "Meanwhile, he said, there was \"a tremendous amount of domestic violence\u2026 a tremendous amount of violence towards children [and] a tremendous amount of violence towards other countrymen.\"",
      "Fetherston said residents' alleged friends and relatives would constantly cycle through the facility where he worked. Despite policies about residents coming through security, staffing was stretched so thin that actually keeping track of who was coming in and out was near impossible.",

      "Pictured are items allegedly found in Leonardo Andujar Sanchez's possession when he was arrested at a Revere, Massachusetts, migrant shelter on Dec. 27. (ERO Boston)",
      "\"[The Revere arrest] touch[es] the hot point [for me] from day three, maybe, of me being in the shelter,\" Fetherston said. \"'Who's that?\u2026 I didn't check them in. I didn't see them when they came in. Who were they?\u2026 How did this guy get past?' 'Well, that's so-and-so's uncle.'\"",
      "Oftentimes, he said, families would \"disappear\" \u2013 housekeeping would report that a family had not been in their room for three or four days. He would get calls about residents showing up at the facility, and they would never arrive, or a person whose ID did not match at all would show up.",
      "Since a ruling handed down by the Supreme Court in November of last year, after Fetherston left the shelter, shelters are not allowed to ask families for identification or documents when they are applying for its short-term shelter program.",
      "This distinction, he said, makes Democratic Gov. Maura Healey's recent call to further vet emergency shelter residents to ensure that they are in the U.S. legally, with rare exceptions, impossible.",
      "\"I believe these changes are appropriate and needed to ensure the long-term sustainability of the state shelter system in a way that aligns with the original intent of the law,\" Healey said in a statement. \"In addition, these proposed changes will allow us to continue to ensure the safety of our system, support cities and towns in addressing the needs of unhoused families in their communities and put us on the path toward a more fiscally sustainable shelter system.\"",
      "\"She can say she will increase vetting, but how do you vet someone who has no ID? She also wants migrants to self-identify if they have committed crimes in the past \u2013 that's not going to happen,\" Fetherston said.",

      "Fetherston said he has had to turn away American citizens who had fallen on hard times amid the chaos at the state's migrant shelters.",
      "\"I would have veterans walk up to the shelter, [saying] \u2018I am a Vietnam veteran, I just need a room for tonight.\u2019 And I would say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry. This is for migrants. All the public is not allowed. This is for migrants only,'\" he recalled.",

      "\"I wasn't always able to find, you know, a homeless veteran a place on a cold night.

And I'm sending a decorated veteran out into the cold. At least half a dozen times I had to do that.\"",
      "He also said that, although there are technically limitations to how long one can stay in the state's shelters, they are not always enforced, and spots for citizens in need are not made available.",
      "\"You can't blame the people who stepped up and tried to do their job. You have to blame the system and the person running the system for not putting checks and balances,\" Fetherston said. \"The governor had no plan and she just wanted to get these shelters open\u2026 Nobody specializes in this \u2013 Massachusetts is the only state in the entire nation that has the right to shelter. So it's fair to say, well, they didn't have qualified people. Well, nobody's qualified for this because nobody's ever had to experience this.\"",

      "The deal, brokered by Qatari negotiators and facilitated by Egyptian intermediaries, also saw significant involvement from the United States. Both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration applied strategic pressure to finalize the agreement, despite concerns about Hamas rearming and internal tensions within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition.",
      "Sources told Fox News Digital that a weekend meeting between Netanyahu and Trump's incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, led to the breakthrough.

      "The agreement calls for the release of three hostages on the first day, followed by weekly batches. Women, children, and men over 50 will be prioritized initially, with younger men in humanitarian cases included later. Updates on hostages\u2019 statuses will alternate between announcements of survivors and confirmation of those who did not survive captivity.",
      "The operation\u2019s execution relies on extensive coordination among the IDF, Shin Bet, Israeli Police, the Ministry of Health, the International Red Cross, and Egyptian authorities. Over 42 days, 33 Israeli hostages are expected to be released. Early stages will focus on civilian women, children and female soldiers, followed by elderly men. The final hostage in this group is scheduled for release on the 42nd day.",

      "On the 16th day, the second phase will begin, addressing the release of younger men, soldiers, and the return of remains. Netanyahu assured hostage families that every captive is accounted for in the deal. Approximately 1,000 Palestinian prisoners will be freed in exchange, with murder convicts barred from returning to the West Bank. Instead, they will be sent to Gaza, Qatar, or Turkey.",
      "The cease-fire will also facilitate significant humanitarian aid to Gaza, with up to 600 trucks of supplies entering daily. By the 22nd day, displaced residents will be allowed to return to northern Gaza. Qatari and Egyptian teams will manage vehicle inspections, while pedestrian crossings will not require checks.

Before each release stage, Israel will receive updated information on their identities and health statuses. The International Red Cross will oversee their transfer from Gaza to Israel, ensuring their safety while addressing logistical challenges such as crowd control.",
      "Upon entering Israel, hostages will undergo identity verification and initial questioning by Shin Bet and the IDF.

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Democratic lawmakers who boycotted Trump's first inauguration say they feel compelled to go this time, while protests are expected to be a fraction of their 2017 size.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump\u2019s first inauguration was marked by riots in the streets of Washington and spurred global counterprotests that included millions, including what was estimated to be the largest single-day of protest in U.S. history. The turnout set the stage for four years of vociferous demonstrations against a president whose victory was seen as a fluke.",
      "This year, ahead of Trump\u2019s second inauguration, which falls on Monday\u2019s Martin Luther King Day holiday, thousands are expected to turn out at demonstrations to honor King and protest Trump. But their numbers are expected to be far smaller than they were eight years ago as the burning intensity of the anti-Trump \u201cResistance\u201d movement cooled to a smolder in the wake of his second victory \u2014 the first time Trump has won the popular vote.",
      "The result is an emboldened Trump and weakened grassroots opposition, with some questioning whether all the protesting, donating, door-knocking and letter-writing they did during his first term amounted to much of anything.",
      "Anti-Trump marches will be smaller, celebrities more likely to stay on the sidelines, and corporations, which at times found themselves in an uneasy alliance with left-leaning protesters, donating to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and sending their CEOs to attend.",
      "\u201cThis is not going to be a time of resistance like it was in 2017,\u201d said Donna Brazile, the veteran Democratic activist and former Democratic National Committee chair.",
      "Trump\u2019s favorability rating is at an all-time high, reaching net positivity \u2014 meaning more people approve of him than disapprove of him \u2014 for the first time since pollsters began tracking him. Even Democratic polls show pluralities of Americans expecting the economy and immigration to improve on his watch.",
      "While around 60 Democratic lawmakers boycotted Trump\u2019s first inauguration, fewer are planning to be absent this year. Some of those who plan to skip say it\u2019s for unrelated reasons. For instance, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who attended Trump\u2019s first inauguration, will not be at the second and is recovering from recent surgery.",
      "Some who plan to be elsewhere for the inauguration are not calling it a boycott. Even Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., one of the most outspoken progressives on Capitol Hill, chalked up her planned absence to a \u201cgeneral conflict of logistics\u201d rather than an intention to snub Trump.",
      "California Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman, who boycotted Trump\u2019s first inauguration, plans to attend Monday, telling Politico, \u201cIt\u2019s different now. ... Whether we like it or not, this guy was just elected by the country with full disclosure of all of his ugliness.\u201d",
      "Recently elected Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who as a member of the House in 2017 boycotted Trump\u2019s first inauguration, said he\u2019s going this time.",
      "\u201cThe electorate sent a very clear message in this last cycle that they want an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to work together,\u201d he told Phoenix-based NBC affiliate KPNX-TV. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m going to come to this office with an approach of trying to do my best in the best interests of all Arizonans, and part of that is to participate in this ceremony.\u201d",
      "A march on Washington is taking place Saturday. And authorities are bracing for potential disruption in the nation\u2019s capital on Monday. But all signs point to a smaller reaction to Trump\u2019s swearing-in than eight years ago, when some demonstrators burned cars and smashed shop windows, while\u00a0notable liberals gathered across the city for counterprogramming events.",
      "As of Friday afternoon, fewer than 50,000 people had RSVP\u2019d to participate in the People\u2019s March, the Saturday rally planned by some of the same groups that organized the 2017 Women\u2019s March. That turnout would be far smaller than eight years ago, when as many as 500,000 people were estimated to have flooded downtown Washington.",
      "A planned satellite protest in West Palm Beach, Florida, home to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, had fewer than 300 RSVPs Friday afternoon. Another in New York City had about 1,500 RSVPs.",
      "Separately, the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader and MSNBC host, is planning a rally to honor King at a historic Black church in Washington several blocks north of the White House.",
      "Meanwhile, speaking from her animal sanctuary near Joshua Tree, California, Women\u2019s March co-founder Vanessa Wruble told the BBC she\u2019s not attending the anti-inaugural march this year.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know it was still a thing,\u201d she told the news outlet.",
      "At the same time, the celebrities whose megaphones helped amplify the anti-Trump movement around his 2017 inauguration have quieted.",
      "Trump struggled to attract top-name talent to perform at his first inauguration, with a long list of artists reportedly refusing to participate. By contrast, Carrie Underwood is set to perform this time, facing some backlash online \u2014 but also earning some unlikely defenders like Whoopi Goldberg.",
      "The Golden Globes ceremony that preceded Trump\u2019s first inauguration was marked by impassioned anti-Trump speeches from stars like Meryl Streep, Hugh Laurie and Viola Davis. But at this month\u2019s ceremony, the presenters were more muted, making only vague allusions to \u201cdifficult moments\u201d for the country.",
      "A long list of celebrities participated in the 2017 Women\u2019s Marches, including Scarlett Johansson, Alec Baldwin, Cher, Emma Watson, Julia Roberts, Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal, Alicia Keys and many more.",
      "The speakers\u2019 list at Saturday\u2019s march is lower-wattage, composed mainly of activists, though some celebrities may still attend the event.",
      "\u201cEntertainment and culture is going to feel a lot less squeamish\u201d about Trump, comedian Josh Gondelman wrote on X. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be less resistance-based entertainment and more pandering to who they imagine Trump voters are.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s inauguration will be closely followed by a conservative event, the annual anti-abortion March for Life, which organizers expect will draw some 150,000 next weekend \u2014 three times the estimated turnout for this Saturday\u2019s anti-Trump march."

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 11:00:00 GMT",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As Republicans gear up for new jobs in the second Trump administration, people who worked for Donald Trump the first time around are dispensing advice about a must-buy item for those coming to Washington.",
      "It\u2019s not an article of clothing or a trendy apartment, and it is something most hope they will never use.",
      "Incoming administration staffers are being warned to weigh the threat of a pricey legal defense and consider purchasing a form of legal insurance that would provide them a lawyer if needed, a protection that many now consider part of doing business after former Trump aides were hauled before congressional committees and grand juries over the past eight years, five former senior administration officials and longtime Washington advisers said.",
      "In a cautionary move, Trump\u2019s transition has briefed some incoming administration staff members on the need to price and buy professional liability insurance, according to two people familiar with the warnings. The transition did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "It is a need that former aides said they realized they had during Trump\u2019s first impeachment. \u201cEveryone started getting it,\u201d a former administration official said. This person went without insurance and emerged unscathed but said if they returned, they would not be so cavalier.",
      "\u201cYou need legal representation if you\u2019re facing people who have the arms of the government at their disposal,\u201d said a former White House official who also was not covered by insurance during the last administration but has purchased it since. \u201cIt\u2019s very intimidating when you don\u2019t have people on your side to tell you what you can do and what circumstances you might be walking into.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s edging into absolute requirement territory,\u201d said a second former Trump White House official. \u201cIt would be reckless if you have any assets to protect \u2014 the house, college funds, whatever.\u201d",
      "Better prepared",
      "Washington insiders have long sounded a note of caution when advising incoming administration officials about the legal risks they could face as they go about their jobs.",
      "\u201cOne thing I tell every client considering taking a political appointment in a new administration, whether Republican or Democrat, is to expect that they could get drawn into an investigation and to think hard about whether they are willing to take that risk and whether they\u2019re prepared for it,\u201d said Robert Kelner, the head of the congressional investigations practice at the law firm Covington & Burling. \u201cIt\u2019s just become so routine that it\u2019s almost to be assumed, and it can be very distracting and burdensome and occasionally expensive for political appointees.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a lesson many learned the hard way. During Trump\u2019s first term, White House aides said they would not cooperate with Democrats\u2019 probes, and current and former officials rebuffed demands to testify before Congress during special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry, and the probe in the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "Two former Trump advisers \u2014 Steve Bannon and Roger Stone \u2014 ultimately served jail time for refusing to cooperate with congressional investigations.",
      "\u201cI often say that congressional investigations are like the wild, wild West because there are no rules,\u201d Kelner said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about who\u2019s the quicker draw, and who\u2019s tougher, and who\u2019s more clever. So there\u2019s a lot of strategy, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of posturing, but not a lot of law, not a lot of rules governing the process.\u201d",
      "Some in Washington see a business opportunity in helping to defray the cost of legal expenses for government workers. Anthony Vergnetti left his job as a lawyer more than a decade ago to launch an insurance firm protecting government workers from legal exposure. Vergnetti said in a \u201cFEDTalk\u201d podcast interview that aired in 2023 that the cost of a policy can range from $250 to $400 and often extends for a number of months after a person leaves their government job. Certain agencies help pay part of the cost, he said. Vergnetti declined to be interviewed by NBC News.",
      "Brace for the worst",
      "In May 2017, Trump was barely five months into office and already the hint of potential congressional investigations was prompting aides to brace for cover. In a memoir of his 500-day stretch in the Trump White House, former White House director of message strategy Cliff Sims wrote that a leaked story falsely reported that he and another colleague would be helming a \u201cRussia War Room\u201d \u2014 and immediately yoked them to a political live wire.",
      "\u201cWe were livid,\u201d Sims wrote in \u201cTeam of Vipers: My 500 Extraordinary Days in the Trump White House.\u201d \u201cFirst of all, it wasn\u2019t true. But more concerning was that being connected to anything Russia-related opened up the possibility of legal bills that could easily be more than a year\u2019s salary in the White House.\u201d",
      "The hope is that this time around, aides will enter with some cover as Trump begins rolling out a promised immigration crackdown and a sweep of executive actions.",
      "A former senior Trump White House official said that Trump\u2019s staff members \u2014 unlike the president himself, whose core presidential powers are protected \u2014 bear the brunt of any actions that could come under future legal fire.",
      "\u201cIf Trump gives an illegal order and you do it out of loyalty to him, you are liable,\u201d the former senior official said. \u201cHe\u2019s protected, you\u2019re not. You can find yourself with a serious legal problem, while he\u2019s protected.\u201d",
      "Trump used a political account to help pay for lawyers for some of his allies who were summoned before the Jan. 6 committee and grand juries, but that assistance didn\u2019t stretch to everyone. And even when it did, at least one recipient didn\u2019t believe it helped.",
      "Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson appeared before the Jan. 6 committee with a lawyer who had been paid by Trump\u2019s allies. She later secured a lawyer of her own and returned to the committee to offer more information, saying she felt the first attorney was giving her bad advice. In her book, Hutchinson wrote about the anxiety she faced about being unable to pay for her own lawyer, including traveling to her estranged biological father\u2019s house to beg him to help her retain a lawyer and an offer from an aunt and uncle to mortgage their house to foot the bill.",
      "The investigations into Trump left other staff members staring down a gantlet of costly lawyer\u2019s fees as they sought out representation that wouldn\u2019t leave them saddled with a mountain of legal debt. Investigations into Trump continued after he left office, leading White House alumni to help set up a charity to help pay for the legal defense of certain co-defendants.",
      "\u201cThese are things that people that have been around Washington know, to get liability insurance,\u201d the first former White House official explained. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t necessarily told to everybody last time, but in a difficult way, we eventually figured out.\u201d",
      "The advice this person is dispensing today? \u201cPrepare for the worst. You never know.\u201d",
      "One former Republican official who worked for the party made the argument that if you have any level of exposure to potential subpoenas, insurance is nondiscretionary. \u201cYou have got to buy insurance. It\u2019s not one of these \u2018I\u2019m going to roll the dice\u2019 scenarios. You self-insure,\u201d said the former official. Certain insurers will even allow you to roll it into your current home or auto coverage.",
      "Said the former first White House official: \u201cFor most, that can do some damage to your bank account.\u201d",
      "Mike Howell, a lawyer who represented a high-profile client pro bono in front of the Jan. 6 committee, said the dynamic generates perverse incentives among Republican attorneys at a time when incoming political appointees are more at risk than ever.",
      "\u201cThe right\u2019s lawyers exist to make a lot money off these conflicts; they see it as a client base and a market,\u201d Howell argued. \u201cAnd so, when young people are subject to these lawfare exercises, there is nobody to protect them.\u201d",
      "Not a new phenomenon",
      "The threat of political investigations is hardly new. There was the Benghazi report, where Congress flexed its powers, the probe into whether George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department ordered the dismissal of U.S. attorneys, and an impeachment inquiry into Bill Clinton. Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency saw the Iran-Contra affair.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re kind of in low-intensity conflict, is what the Defense Department guys like to call it,\u201d said the second former White House official. \u201cThis low-level warfare goes on all the time. The only question is, can they figure out some way to damage you personally, not just as an official of the government?\u201d",
      "Yet incoming political staffers on both sides of the aisle, and especially those new to government, have not always thought to buy insurance. The thinking is that if an administration official were to be called in for questioning over a work matter, they could safely rely on the government\u2019s counsel.",
      "But that promise has failed to halt concerns. One former Obama White House official recalled how friends at the State Department began searching for cover as congressional Republicans promised a drumbeat of investigations into the assault that killed Americans at the U.S. Mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.",
      "And Kelner said he does not recall a situation where he represented someone in government and his firm\u2019s fees were paid by an insurance policy \u2014 suggesting these were not likely geared toward the rates of Big Law.",
      "The person may instead find themselves with an attorney selected by their provider and not one of the handful of white shoe partners with experience before the most challenging government investigations, meaning some insurance may not offer the kind of coverage that some come to expect. The corollary is the more charged the inquiry, the higher the potential reputational cost.",
      "Kelner said Clinton\u2019s presidency marked a turning point as partisan, politicized investigations ramped up with no sign of slowing. \u201cIt never really stopped after that,\u201d he added."

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "China hacking threat",
    "story": [
      "As President-elect Donald Trump enters his second term Monday, he\u2019s facing down an unprecedented foreign threat: Chinese hackers.",
      "In the last several years, three distinct Chinese hacking campaigns have occurred in the United States \u2014 even reportedly infiltrating U.S. government computers belonging to top Biden administration officials.",
      "While China has long been a top cyber adversary for the U.S., over the course of the Biden administration it has become more dogged and ambitious than ever before, experts and U.S. officials say, building to what has become perhaps the biggest cyber challenge the U.S. has faced to date.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that the risk of Chinese cyberattacks has gone up,\u201d said Adam Segal, who served as a senior cybersecurity adviser in the State Department last year. \u201cAnd Chinese capabilities have seemed to have notably increased over the last four years.\u201d",
      "The most recent breach, discovered in December, gave the hackers access to files from the Treasury Department. The department described the breach as a \u201cmajor incident\u201d and sanctioned a Chinese company for allegedly helping that country\u2019s cyber programs. Another, called Salt Typhoon, included a massive compromise of telecommunications companies, including AT&T and Verizon, and gave the hackers access to the Trump and Harris campaigns\u2019 phone calls last year, as well as the phone records of more than a million Americans. FBI Director Christopher Wray said last month it may prove to be the \u201cmost significant cyber espionage campaign in history.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the biggest threat, known as Volt Typhoon, consists of hackers stealthily burrowing into infrastructure, including power, communications and water facilities. In a marked departure from other alleged Chinese hacking campaigns, which generally seem designed to collect intelligence, U.S. officials say Volt Typhoon is pre-positioning in case of military conflict \u2014 particularly if China were to invade the self-ruling island of Taiwan \u2014 to cause mass chaos and hamper the U.S. from conducting a full and immediate response.",
      "While AT&T and Verizon say they have worked to clear the hackers from their systems, White House officials have said that both the Salt and Volt Typhoon hacks should be considered perpetual operations and that the hackers are unlikely to give up trying to get back in. China has denied being behind all three hacking campaigns.",
      "As the Biden administration prepares to depart the White House, there are indications that the government realizes it has not done enough to stop China-backed hackers.",
      "On Thursday, in one of his final official acts as president, Joe Biden signed an executive order that largely tackles cybersecurity problems, including giving the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency more power to monitor federal networks for hackers.",
      "According to a memo published on Jan. 6 by the Southern Nevada Counter Terrorism Center \u2014 one of dozens of fusion centers across the U.S. that share law enforcement and intelligence information \u2014 senators received multiple briefings on Salt Typhoon last month. The memo, seen by NBC News, is unclassified but marked for official use only, and was provided to NBC News by Property of the People, a nonprofit that uses freedom of information requests to obtain hidden government documents.",
      "In at least one of those briefings, private experts told senators that countering China would require both hardening U.S. telephone networks \u2014 a massive investment \u2014 and beginning \u201ca sustained, direct, and more forceful effort to disincentivize Chinese espionage.\u201d One expert suggested the U.S. create a \u201ccredible threat of painful retaliation\u201d for such campaigns.",
      "Trump\u2019s incoming team has said it plans to be more confrontational and aggressive against China.",
      "\u201cFor too long our country has been on defense when it comes to cyberattacks,\u201d Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance transition spokesperson, told NBC News in an emailed statement.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to imposing costs on private and nation state actors who continue to steal our data and attack our infrastructure,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., told CBS News last month that the next administration would take \u201ca different approach to cyber.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to start going on offense and start imposing, I think, higher costs and consequences to private actors and nation state actors that continue to steal our data, that continue to spy on us, and that even worse, with the Volt Typhoon penetration, that are literally putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "Waltz declined in the interview to say whether that could include sanctions, and did not otherwise describe what such deterrence might mean.",
      "During his first term, Trump eliminated the federal government\u2019s cybersecurity czar, a move that attracted intense criticism from Democrats. Experts praised the Biden administration\u2019s cyber policies, despite what appeared to be steeply escalating issues affecting citizens and the government itself.",
      "Chris Painter, the top cyber diplomat during the Obama administration, said it was clear that China\u2019s cyber activity is not being deterred, but that it isn\u2019t clear how the Trump administration\u2019s approach would fix that.",
      "\u201cThere has been a lot of activity over the years, both in the Trump administration and this administration, but it hasn\u2019t protected us from these massive events. They\u2019re going to have to take this seriously,\u201d he said.",
      "Vulnerabilities in private companies, like those exploited to give hackers access to American telecoms, are \u201can enduring problem\u201d that Biden\u2019s team tried to address with regulations that are unlikely to last under Trump, Painter said. Trump campaigned on the \u201cmost aggressive regulatory reduction\u201d and has vowed to sign a flurry of executive orders on his first day in office, many overturning Biden policies.",
      "\u201cSo how do you cure that? The Biden administration, for the first time in years, has moved to this idea in the national cyber strategy that maybe it\u2019s time to think about the dirty word of regulation and have more responsibility. I think that\u2019s out the window in the new administration.\u201d",
      "Segal, the former Biden official, said the U.S. won\u2019t be able to convince China to stop conducting cyber espionage, especially given the United States\u2019 own long history of that practice.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very little that can be done or said to China about espionage,\u201d Segal told NBC News. \u201cCountries are going to commit espionage and then continue committing espionage, and so really it\u2019s on us to better defend ourselves.\u201d",
      "The Biden White House has conducted operations to disrupt China\u2019s hacking infrastructure, same as it does with other hackers adversarial to the U.S. On Tuesday, the Justice Department and the FBI announced they had removed a type of malware that China has used to infect Americans\u2019 computers to unwittingly do Beijing\u2019s bidding.",
      "Most of the operations that the U.S. Cyber Command conducts, including disrupting Chinese hacking operations, are classified, making it impossible to fully judge their effectiveness. But it\u2019s not clear that simply disrupting that kind of hacker infrastructure is an effective long-term plan, said Brandon Wales, the executive director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cOffensive cyber operations can complicate adversary planning and disrupt operational infrastructure, but we have seen both nation-state and criminal organizations reconstitute that infrastructure relatively quickly,\u201d Wales, now the vice president for cybersecurity strategy at cybersecurity company SentinelOne, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhere the U.S. government has its best access to Chinese networks, do we want to burn those on operations now or save those for conflict when they could mean the difference between life and death?\u201d he said."

    "summary": "Since two gene therapies were approved for sickle cell disease in late 2023, only a handful of patients have started the expensive treatments.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 For Wedam Minyila, hospital rooms have always meant blinding pain. \u201cLike someone is jamming a knife in me,\u201d he said.",
      "But for a brief moment on a recent December morning, Wedam, 19, who has sickle cell disease, allowed himself to believe what his doctors had been telling him for months: This visit could be the first step to a cure. As one of the first patients in the world to undergo commercial treatment for the genetic condition, he could start imagining a future free of excruciating pain.",
      "\u201cI choose to partially believe it,\u201d he said the day he was admitted to Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., for his stem cell collection \u2014 the first major step of the revolutionary sickle cell gene therapy process. \u201cBut that also comes with the skepticism of: Will it really work?\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the same question sickle cell patients nationwide have been asking since the Food and Drug Administration approved two gene therapies that could cure the symptoms of the disease just over a year ago.",
      "Since then, only a few dozen patients nationwide have been able to access it. Paperwork snarls, a multimillion-dollar price tag and patient concerns over serious side effects mean only a limited number of hospitals have treated patients so far.",
      "More than 100,000 people in the United States \u2014 9 in 10 of them Black \u2014 have sickle cell disease. The inherited illness causes red blood cells, usually round, to contort into a crescent, or sickle, shape. The sickle-shaped cells often pile up in blood vessels, resulting in excruciating pain, strokes, damage to organs and shorter lives. The new gene therapies, one from Boston-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the other from Somerville, Massachusetts-based Bluebird Bio, offer a potential cure.",
      "That\u2019s why Wedam pushed past his skepticism \u2014 and worked through months of insurance approvals and medical consultations.",
      "\u201cI know what it can mean for me,\u201d he said quietly as a team of medical professionals began swarming his bedside. \u201cBut until it happens, I\u2019m not really as excited as everybody else.\u201d",
      "His mom, Sylvia, watched from the corner of the room, holding her breath. \u201cThis is a brand-new thing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I never thought that, you know, we would be one of the pacesetters for this. It feels unreal.\u201d",
      "But the first step of what she describes as her \u201cmiracle\u201d was happening before her eyes: Nurses gave her son a medication to mobilize stem cells normally trapped inside the bone marrow to flow into the bloodstream. A couple of hours later, Wedam was hooked up to what\u2019s known as an apheresis machine, which draws blood out of the body and then spins it at high speeds to separate out the millions of stem cells before it returns the rest of blood back into the veins.",
      "Dr. Andrew Campell stepped to Wedam\u2019s bedside as the first of the light orange liquid containing his stem cells began collecting in an IV bag hanging next to him.",
      "\u201cYou are one of the few in the country and even in the world, you know, taking this big step \u2014\u00a0 gene therapy,\u201d said Campbell, director of the hospital\u2019s Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease Program. \u201cIt took a lot of bravery, because I know this is still very new in the process.\u201d",
      "Wedam looked unfazed. \u201cI had to,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not something I could really pass up. So I didn\u2019t really have a choice.\u201d",
      "A learning curve for hospitals",
      "In coming months, Wedam\u2019s cells will be shipped to a lab in Tennessee, where technicians will use a gene-editing tool called CRISPR to modify a gene in the stem cells so they produce red blood cells that are less likely to sickle and block blood flow, resulting in pain crises.",
      "Wedam will need intensive chemotherapy to wipe out his existing stem cells and make room in his bone marrow for the gene-edited cells, which a team at Children\u2019s National Hospital will reintroduce into his bloodstream intravenously.",
      "\u201cTo be able to deliver a therapy that is a cure and is going to keep him out of the hospital and is likely going to extend life, this is amazing,\u201d said Dr. David Jacobsohn, Children\u2019s National\u2019s chief of blood and marrow transplantation. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very powerful what we\u2019re able to provide now compared to five or 10 years ago.\u201d",
      "Even so, Jacobsohn acknowledged few patients have begun the gene therapy treatment. At Children\u2019s National \u2014 which was ahead of the curve after it participated in Bluebird Bio\u2019s clinical trials \u2014 only 10 people, including Wedam, have initiated or finished the process. That\u2019s out of a pool of about 1,500 patients with sickle cell disease that the team treats in the Washington area.",
      "\u201cAt first, leadership in the hospital, they were super excited. They said: \u2018We have dozens and dozens of patients eligible. We need to build more beds!\u2019 And my feeling is eventually we will, but it\u2019s not going to happen right away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a learning curve for the hospitals, and it\u2019s been a learning curve for the insurance companies.\u201d",
      "Jacobsohn said his team is ramping up to start one or two patients on the treatment per month\u00a0 \u2014 a pace he called \u201cexciting.\u201d",
      "\u201cRemember, this is a very high-risk treatment requiring high-dose chemotherapy with potential for complications,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not something that we would want to ramp up too rapidly.\u201d",
      "The monthslong treatment Casgevy from Vertex Pharmaceuticals comes with a list price of $2.3 million. Bluebird Bio\u2019s Lyfgenia is listed at $3.1 million. Neither includes the cost of care to stay in the hospital or for chemotherapy.",
      "To manage the hefty price tag, insurers have implemented extensive pre-authorization procedures. Both drug companies told NBC News they have yet to see an \u201cultimate denial\u201d for their drugs.",
      "The procedure is resource-intensive for the limited number of hospitals authorized to deliver it,\u00a0requiring multiple days in the hospital for the stem cell collection and, months later, multiweek hospital stays for chemotherapy and the reintroduction of the stem cells, Jacobsohn said. In between, the stem cell processing lab needs several months to genetically alter the cells and perform safety checks before it sends them back to the hospital for infusion.",
      "For patients like Wedam, there are other considerations, too. The intensive chemotherapy lasts four days and makes patients extremely ill and susceptible to infection. Many develop ulcerating sores in their mouths, throats and esophagi that make eating nearly impossible. Longer-term, the chemotherapy raises the risk of cancer and infertility.",
      "For all of those reasons, only a single patient has completed the process at City of Hope Children\u2019s Cancer Center in Los Angeles. Dr. Leo Wang, a pediatric hematologist-oncologist at the center, says he expects that number to rise rapidly in coming months after the \u201cearly adopters\u201d start showing success.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that uptake will increase and become more acceptable to people who are maybe a little bit more risk-averse,\u201d Wang said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve already seen that where we\u2019ll have patients come and ask us about it and say, \u2018Well, I\u2019d really like to talk to somebody who\u2019s been through this already and get their perspective, and then maybe I\u2019ll be interested in doing that.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u2018God, you did this for me\u2019",
      "That\u2019s one of Wedam\u2019s motivations for becoming an \u201cearly adopter.\u201d \u201cIf all of those people could see me and see that it works, they\u2019ll have some hope,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a tiny bit.\u201d",
      "The disease has robbed him of his ability to do much of anything, including getting out of bed. But the idea of a cure has him dreaming of some day becoming a filmmaker.",
      "Near-term, his ambitions are much smaller \u2014 he\u2019d like to attend his college classes in person instead of online.",
      "\u201cNow, I don\u2019t really keep up with most of my friends, so I\u2019d be able to make new ones,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be able to learn the material better if I\u2019m in person, asking the teacher actual questions. I just think, being a normal person, doing what a normal person would, I think that is what really excites me.\u201d",
      "The disease ravaged the Minyila family for close to two decades. In addition to Wedam, his 14-year-old brother, Wekem, also has sickle cell.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taken almost everything,\u201d Sylvia Minyila said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken our joy.\u201d",
      "Wedam, she said, was once a happy boy who loved school and dancing. But once his pain crises started around middle school, she said, he changed.",
      "\u201cHe became withdrawn. Anywhere there was bone, he could have pain there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnywhere in the house you were, you could hear him moaning. And this is something that I used to think about regularly: \u2018Am I going to lose him?\u2019 Because he was in so much pain.\u201d",
      "Until the gene therapy, the only cure for sickle cell disease was a stem cell transplant from a donor. That worked for Wekem after Sylvia discovered she was a match for her younger son. After some scary complications, the procedure was successful.",
      "But antibodies in Wedam\u2019s bloodstream prevented the same cure for him.",
      "\u201cI was ecstatic. I said: \u2018God, you did this for me. But what about my other son?\u2019\u201d Sylvia said, tears rolling down her face. \u201cI wanted the same for Wedam.\u201d",
      "She said that when the doctors at Children\u2019s Hospital called her just months later to let her know that Wedam might be a good candidate for the new gene therapy, it felt like a double miracle \u2014 an answer to her prayers.",
      "\u201cAll I kept asking is: \u2018Is it curative? Is this something that he\u2019ll still have to take medications for? Is he going to have pain crises?\u2019 They said, \u2018No.\u2019 And I said: \u2018We\u2019re in. We are in.\u2019\u201d",
      "Wedam has seen his younger brother transform since his treatment \u2014 even using his new energy to teach himself to ride a bike. The excruciating pain before Wekem\u2019s stem cell transplant had made that impossible.",
      "Wekem said he\u2019s looking forward to seeing his older brother be healed.",
      "\u201cI feel like it changed the life that he is going to live,\u201d Wekem said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think that there was going to be something else that was available to us so he could get treated and cured.\u201d",
      "But Wedam remains skeptical. \u201cMaybe 60%,\u201d he said of his odds of being cured.",
      "Still, even with the life-threatening complications that may come, he said, if there\u2019s any chance of a less painful future, it\u2019s worth trying.",
      "NBC News will continue following Wedam Minyila\u2019s journey as he begins the next phases of his sickle cell treatment."

    "story": [
      "When the Detroit Lions and the Washington Commanders square off in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs Saturday, don\u2019t expect to see many punts or field goals.",
      "The Lions and the Commanders are two of the most aggressive fourth-down teams in the NFL, and their coaches\u2019 willingness to be bold will almost certainly be a major factor in who advances to the NFC championship game.",
      "During the regular season, Detroit and Washington ranked second and third, respectively, in giving themselves the biggest edge on fourth downs in a formula devised by The Athletic\u2019s Austin Mock.",
      "The Commanders, in fact, are appearing in Saturday's matchup in large part because of their mettle on do-or-die downs. Washington went for it five times on fourth down against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in its playoff opener. It converted three of those attempts, including a fourth-and-2 in the fourth quarter for a go-ahead touchdown.",
      "\u201cWe were going to be bold but not reckless,\u201d Commanders coach Dan Quinn said. Quinn kept going for it on fourth down even after the team didn\u2019t convert its first attempt of the night.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s who we are the whole season,\u201d he added. \u201cBut when you do get stopped early, you just have to stay the course knowing that \u2018hey, keep your chin tucked and keep swinging,\u2019 knowing that this is going to be a game that\u2019s going to go all the way down to the end.\u201d",
      "While Washington finished first in the NFL in fourth-down conversion percentage during the regular season (87%) \u2014 the best mark in NFL history for a team with more than 10 attempts \u2014 Quinn is kind of stealing Detroit\u2019s whole flow.",
      "Since Dan Campbell took over the Lions in 2021, no other team has attempted more fourth-down conversions. Campbell was doing it even when his team wasn\u2019t good, having introduced his bold strategy during the Lions\u2019 3-13-1 season in his first year at the helm.",
      "Campbell\u2019s unapologetic nature on fourth down has been polarizing, even as he has made it easier for coaches like Quinn to adopt a version of it for themselves.",
      "In last year\u2019s NFC championship game against the San Francisco 49ers, Detroit went 1-for-3 on fourth down in a 34-31 loss, a game in which they led by 17 at one point. Both failed attempts came while the team was in field goal range, including once while the 49ers led 27-24.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t regret those decisions,\u201d Campbell said after the game.",
      "Campbell shocked even some of the most analytics-pilled NFL onlookers this season when he attempted a late fourth-down conversion against the Green Bay Packers.",
      "In a tie game with 43 seconds left, the Lions had a fourth-and-1 on the Packers\u2019 21-yard line. Green Bay was out of timeouts. A field goal would have given Detroit a 34-31 lead, and the Packers would have had to drive into field-goal range with no timeouts on their next possession.",
      "Instead, Detroit went for it and picked up the yard on a handoff even after quarterback Jared Goff stumbled. The Lions were able to run down the clock and kick the winning field goal as time expired.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019d love to say that if you\u2019re going to do that, you\u2019re going to convert every one of them, but that\u2019s not the reality,\u201d Campbell said after the win. \"It doesn\u2019t always work that way. So, you know, you\u2019re taking a high level of risk. There is risk with it, but I felt like with our guys, it wouldn\u2019t be as big of a risk as it may appear to be.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 23:23:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Roki Sasaki, a 23-year-old right-handed ace from Japan, signed with the MLB.",
    "story": [
      "Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki, the hottest international free agent in baseball, is headed to the Los Angeles Dodgers, he announced on social media Friday.",
      "The 23-year-old right-hander said he signed a minor-league deal. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.",
      "\"I have signed a minor contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers,\" he said on Instagram in a translated post from Japanese to English. \"It was a very difficult decision, but I will do my best to make it the right decision when I look back after my baseball career. I want to slip my sleeve on the Dodgers uniform at the opening conference, thanking everyone who has supported me this far.\"",
      "Sasaki is just the latest Japanese star to join MLB. Reigning National League MVP Shohei Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers ahead of the 2024 season after six years with the Los Angeles Angels. The franchise also brought in pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto in 2023 on a 12-year, $325 million deal. Both were instrumental in Los Angeles winning the 2024 World Series.",
      "Sasaki's long-awaited signing follows a suspenseful offseason, during which teams including the, San Diego Padres, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Yankees, the Chicago Cubs and the San Francisco Giants courted the young pitcher. For his initial meetings with teams, Sasaki requested that no players be present, prompting much speculation around his landing spot.",
      "By Monday, Sasaki had narrowed down his finalists to Blue Jays, Dodgers and Padres. Many saw the Dodgers as the long-held favorites thanks to his experience playing with Ohtani and Yamamoto on the Japanese national team and the team\u2019s star-studded lineup. The Padres were also seen as a major contender because Sasaki would be reunited with his one-time mentor, accomplished Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish.",
      "Despite Sasaki\u2019s draw, his contract isn\u2019t the blockbuster that others like Ohtani have signed because of MLB rules. International players under the age of 25 are considered amateurs and can only sign a minor-league contract with an additional bonus.",
      "Sasaki, who played for the Chiba Lotte Marines in Japan\u2019s Nippon Professional Baseball League, has a career ERA of 2.10 with 505 career strikeouts and a 29-15 record. In 2022, he threw a perfect game against the Orix Buffaloes, NPB\u2019s first perfect game in almost 30 years. His stellar performance earned him the nickname \u201cthe Monster of the Reiwa Era,\u201d referring to Japan\u2019s current political era. Still, Sasaki has said he has more to learn in MLB.",
      "\u201cRoki is by no means a finished product,\u201d Sasaki\u2019s agent Joel Wolfe told Sports Illustrated of his move to the U.S. \u201cHe knows it, and the teams know it. He\u2019s incredibly talented. We all know that. But he is a guy that wants to be great. He\u2019s not coming here just to be rich or to get a huge contract. He wants to be great. He wants to be one of the greatest ever.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 13:10:01 GMT",
    "summary": "This weekend's divisional round of the NFL playoffs features two quarterbacks in remarkably similar positions.",
    "story": [
      "This weekend's divisional round of the NFL playoffs features two quarterbacks in remarkably similar positions. Josh Allen of the Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens are the leading MVP candidates this season.",
      "Both signal callers are seeking their first Super Bowl appearances as they have both been unable to get past Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs. They are also dual threats: Jackson led all quarterbacks this year with 915 rushing yards. Allen was fifth with 531.",
      "The two face each other Sunday in arguably the marquee game of the weekend, which also features the Chiefs hosting the Houston Texans and the Detroit Lions and the Washington Commanders on Saturday. Sunday's other contest is between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Los Angeles Rams.",
      "With a multitude of storylines to watch, NBC News\u2019 Rohan Nadkarni and Andrew Grief and NBC Sports\u2019 Patrick Daugherty are here to break it down from every angle.",
      "Lamar Jackson faces Josh Allen on Sunday night. Who is your NFL MVP?",
      "Nadkarni: I feel pretty confident in saying Jackson is the MVP, and it\u2019s not a particularly difficult decision. That\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t close or that Allen doesn\u2019t have a good case. At the same time, Jackson has more passing yards, a higher completion percentage, more passing touchdowns, fewer interceptions, more rushing yards and more total touchdowns. The Bills\u2019 superior record does not matter to me, because the AFC East was not very good. And while Derrick Henry has been a boon to the Ravens\u2019 backfield, it\u2019s not like every quarterback who played with him puts up Lamar numbers.",
      "Greif:\u00a0I think this is a true toss-up, and it must be acknowledged, too, that the presence of Henry at running back made Jackson\u2019s job easier.\u00a0And yet Jackson, to me, pulled off something no other MVP candidate did \u2014 dramatically improve upon what was already an elite skill set.\u00a0Already a two-time MVP, Jackson this season looked like a completely different passer. His percentage of on-target passes was 8 percentage points higher than his career average; he threw a career-high number of passes yet threw a career-low four interceptions, and even then, none of those interceptions could be attributed to a poor throw or decision by Jackson.",
      "Daugherty: It\u2019s Jackson. I\u2019m sympathetic to the idea that it\u2019s a bit crazy Jackson could end up with his third MVP while Allen has zero, but just as players can only play the game in front of them, voters can only vote the season in front of them. Jackson somehow ascended to his most stratospheric statistical heights yet this season, achieving ludicrous levels of efficiency while, you know, leading the league with 47 total touchdowns. The Ravens averaged 6.85 yards per play, the second most in NFL history.",
      "Jackson\u2019s past MVP wins and \u201cfairness\u201d shouldn\u2019t really matter. Was he the best player or not? His statistical case is unassailable, and the Bills\u2019 one extra regular-season victory is hardly enough to swing the argument in Allen\u2019s favor, especially since Jackson\u2019s Ravens roughed the Bills up in their head-to-head matchup. Despite their MVP disparity, you could still argue Allen has had the better career. You can\u2019t argue who had the better season.",
      "What team do you feel differently about after the wild-card round?",
      "Greif:\u00a0The Rams. By the eye test and statistics, their defense profiled as one that might struggle. And the team was playing only days after wildfires devastated Los Angeles, not far from where the team practices. Instead, their pressure and focus absolutely wrecked Minnesota. Dismiss coach Sean McVay\u2019s playoff chances at your own peril.",
      "Daugherty: The Rams. You can debate whether the Rams\u2019 wild-card roughhousing of the Vikings said more about the winner or loser. What is inarguable is that it was yet another playoff game where McVay looked like the most prepared coach this side of Bill Belichick. Relentlessly exploiting the Vikings\u2019 weaknesses while leaning on his strengths, McVay took the approach every coach espouses but few achieve: one play at a time. As the Rams stacked victories one by one, the Vikings spiraled out of control, having no answer for McVay\u2019s game-planning mastery. This is far from McVay\u2019s best squad. It\u2019s also his first without Aaron Donald. It has still proven it deserves \u201cany given Sunday\u201d respect thanks to its deep well of experience and unmatched preparation.",
      "Nadkarni: I picked the Rams to upset the Vikings in this space last week, and even still I\u2019m marveling at the performance they had in the wild-card round. Los Angeles flat-out dominated on both sides of the ball. Watching the Rams\u2019 defensive line against the Eagles\u2019 offensive line is the matchup of the divisional round for me. Los Angeles wasn\u2019t particularly elite during the season in terms of pass-rush win rate, and yet its defensive line mounted pressure on Sam Darnold even when rushing only four. If the Rams can get ahead early and make Jalen Hurts uncomfortable in the pocket, that game becomes a lot more interesting.",
      "Which underdog this weekend has the best chance at an upset?",
      "Daugherty: The Rams. The Eagles forced four turnovers against the Packers and still won only 22-10. It was a one-score game for the first half of the fourth quarter. It was the same story for several months: dominating defense, questionable offense. That\u2019s not great news with McVay\u2019s opportunistic Rams headed for Philly.",
      "The Eagles feasted on Jordan Love\u2019s inexperience and the Packers\u2019 nerves. That\u2019s not going to be an option vs. Los Angeles. When the Eagles\u2019 offense is humming, the Rams are not capable of winning a shootout. We saw that in Philly\u2019s 37-20 victory in Week 12. When Jalen Hurts is struggling and the defense can focus all of its attention on Saquon Barkley, however, the calculus quickly changes. If it\u2019s another 13 completions for 121 yards kind of day for the Eagles\u2019 quarterback, McVay\u2019s Rams will be well-positioned for their second straight upset.",
      "Nadkarni: Picking the Bills \u2014 a very slim underdog at home \u2014 feels like cheating. So I\u2019m going to make an argument on behalf of the Houston Texans. Look, the Texans didn\u2019t exactly wow anyone in the wild-card round when they won a wacky game against the Los Angeles Chargers. But Houston\u2019s defense is absolutely ferocious, with a defensive line and a secondary that wreaks havoc on opposing offenses. Several quarterbacks have looked awful against the Texans this year. And C.J. Stroud, despite his so-so sophomore year, is still proving to be a game changer at the position. Add all this to the Chiefs\u2019 very long layoff and their own offensive malaise this season, and I\u2019m at least expecting a tight game because of Houston\u2019s defense.",
      "Greif:\u00a0At one point this week the Bills were a slight underdog, but as a team that finished 8-0 at home and has beaten the top seeds in each conference, they don\u2019t feel like much of an underdog\u00a0against Baltimore, even though the Ravens have already beaten Buffalo once this season.",
      "Underrated storyline you\u2019re watching",
      "Nadkarni: Can a storyline be underrated if you wrote about it? I will have my eye on the fourth-down attempts between the Lions and the Commanders, though, because I believe the aggressive natures of both teams are going to play a massive role Saturday. Washington went for it on fourth down five times against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while Detroit has been the face of fourth-down aggression since Dan Campbell took over in 2021. Will either of these coaches blink in a big moment? Could the game turn on a failed fourth-down attempt? That will be the game-within-the-game when these teams face off, and it should add a decent dose of drama.",
      "Greif:\u00a0When Houston faces Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes, can its defense make life miserable for yet another top quarterback? Already this season the Texans\u2019 scheme has led Buffalo\u2019s Allen to post a career-worst completion percentage, Detroit\u2019s Jared Goff to throw five interceptions and Miami\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa to throw three interceptions and lose a fumble. The latest data point came in Houston\u2019s wild-card playoff victory last week against the Chargers, when Justin Herbert was intercepted four times \u2014 the same Herbert who had thrown three interceptions in his previous 17 games.",
      "Daugherty: You would think the two-time defending Super Bowl champions\u2019 beginning their quest for a threepeat as 15-2 home favorites would be the storyline of the divisional round. Alas, the Chiefs find themselves well behind the Bills and Ravens\u2019 \u201cgame of the century\u201d and the Lions\u2019 hunt for the first Super Bowl title in franchise history. So I\u2019ll ask: Can the Chiefs win convincingly after an anything but convincing 2024?",
      "Because let\u2019s be real: The Chiefs are going to win. The only question is if they will do so in a fashion that actually makes them favorites for the AFC championship game. You can lean on your \u201cchampionship pedigree\u201d when you are grinding out regular season victories over the Chargers and the Steelers. The same is true for the Texans in the divisional round. But Baltimore or Buffalo with the Lamar Hunt Trophy on the line? We are going to need to see some proof it\u2019s possible this Saturday."

      "Erling Haaland has signed a new contract at Manchester City through 2034, committing his long-term future to the Premier League champions with one of the most lucrative deals in soccer amid uncertain times for the club on and off the field.",
      "City announced the deal \u2014 covering 10 years from the start of this season \u2014 on Friday for the 24-year-old Haaland, who has scored 111 goals in 125 games since joining the club from Borussia Dortmund in 2022 to establish himself as\u00a0one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "The deal is the longest in the Premier League, with Haaland reportedly earning around 500,000 pounds ($600,000) per week.",
      "Asked what his reaction was when told of the unusual length of Haaland\u2019s contract, City manager Pep Guardiola replied: \u201cI said, \u2018Can you repeat?\u2019\u201d",
      "The Norway striker will be turning age 34 when the contract expires. The Athletic reported that the deal removed release clauses that were in his previous contract, which was due to expire in June 2027.",
      "\u201cNow I want to keep developing, keep working to get better and look to do my best to try and help us achieve more success going forward,\u201d Haaland said in a City statement.",
      "The new deal for Haaland comes as City awaits a verdict after being charged with 115 breaches of the Premier League\u2019s financial rules. Possible sanctions include a points deduction or relegation from the top division.",
      "Among\u00a0the promotional material published by City\u00a0to announce the Haaland deal, the striker said tellingly: \u201cNow I am City no matter what.\u201d",
      "In one of the videos, Haaland is seen calling City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak to say: \u201cIt\u2019s all signed now.\u201d",
      "\u201cOK, now I am comfortable,\u201d Khaldoon was heard replying.",

      "It kickstarts what looks like being a busy few weeks for City, which is expected to buy multiple players with the team enduring its worst season since Guardiola joined as manager in 2016.",
      "City is sixth in the Premier League after 21 games of a title defense that has been derailed by injuries to key players and a dip in form of others. Guardiola\u2019s team isn\u2019t even sure of advancing to the knockout stage of the Champions League, either, and has a crucial game against Paris Saint-Germain next week.",
      "City has been linked with signing striker Omar Marmoush from Eintracht Frankfurt and young defenders Abdukodir Khusanov from Lens and Vitor Reis from Palmeiras. They would reportedly cost more than $150 million.",
      "\u201cI am really confident that we will turn things around,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cThings have been difficult as we are so used to winning games, but also it is a challenge for us.",
      "\u201cTo get this feeling of hunger inside every single one of us to not look at things easier. Don\u2019t take things for granted, that is an important thing. I will do everything I can to change things around.\u201d",
      "Haaland scored 52 goals in all competitions \u2014 including a single-season record 36 in the Premier League \u2014 in his first season with City, when the team won the league, FA Cup and Champions League to clinch the Treble.",
      "He scored 38 goals in 45 appearances last season and has 21 goals already in this campaign as he goes for a third straight Golden Boot in the Premier League.",
      "\u201cOf course he is a special player,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cTo find a player like Erling, it\u2019s so difficult to find a striker at that level. Once you have it, you need to make the effort to keep him.\u201d",
      "Haaland, who\u00a0announced in October\u00a0he was expecting his first child with his girlfriend, said it has \u201cbeen like a dream in this two-and-a-half years.\u201d",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "As President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated on Monday, families worry he will fulfill his campaign promise by ordering sweeping deportations across the country.",
    "story": [
      "On a Monday evening in January, South Brooklyn Sanctuary is crowded with dozens of volunteers, translators and migrants. The migrants ask a range of urgent questions \u2014 What does the incoming Trump administration mean for their pending asylum cases? How do you fight a deportation order? And, in the worst-case scenario, how do you prepare for family separation?",
      "They\u2019re fearful that as soon as President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated on Monday, he will fulfill his campaign promise by ordering sweeping deportations across the country. The 210,000 undocumented people who have arrived in New York City since 2022 are also facing Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 closure of the Floyd Bennett Field shelter, which houses 1,800 people, and his threats to roll back the city\u2019s sanctuary policies by overriding the City Council\u2019s opposition with an executive order. Incoming Trump administration officials and Adams have met to discuss deporting migrants who have committed crimes.",
      "Emily Schectman, South Brooklyn Sanctuary director, said the organization is doing what it can to prepare for the uncertainty ahead. In recent weeks, it has had 150 new volunteer sign-ups and expects more after the inauguration. \u201cWe\u2019re predicting that we\u2019ll be doing a lot more deportation defense, ICE watch and anti-family separation work,\u201d she said.",
      "South Brooklyn Sanctuary is one of dozens of groups across the country that operates as a pro se community, teaching migrants to represent themselves \u201con their own behalf\u201d in the legal system with volunteer support. The nonprofit has worked with over 5,000 migrants since opening in 2022 with a pool of over 100 trained and active volunteers. Last year alone, they helped 715 migrants file change-of-address forms so they don\u2019t miss their court dates and risk deportation.",
      "Once in office, Trump has promised to launch the \u201clargest deportation program in American history,\u201d send Congress a bill to ban sanctuary cities and request funding to hire and retain 10,000 new border agents. He has also said he will restrict federally funded benefits to only American citizens and reinstate and expand a travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. During a December interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Trump claimed that he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to deport millions of people, and that \u201cthey\u2019re costing us a fortune,\u201d a claim that has been disputed by economists.",
      "To prepare for the work ahead, South Brooklyn Sanctuary is fundraising for a full-time staff attorney and building a new program to help migrants file motions to reopen their asylum cases, which can combat removal orders. It\u2019s also expanding into a new space this month, where it\u2019ll train a new cohort of French and Arabic-speaking volunteers to accommodate the growing number of migrants from African countries.",
      "\u201cOur promise to the community is that we will remain knowledgeable and be prepared for any policy changes that will happen,\u201d she said.",
      "Training volunteers to support migrants",
      "Emelis, who asked that her last name not be used for fear of deportation, said she left Venezuela after being targeted by the military for her high school protests against authoritarian President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The 26-year-old was almost out of time to apply for asylum when she attended South Brooklyn Sanctuary\u2019s walk-in migration program at Good Shepherd Church in Bay Ridge; asylum applications need to be submitted within a year of an applicant\u2019s arrival date in the United States. With the help of volunteers, she filled out her asylum and work permit forms just in time.",
      "\u201cI felt scared when I first arrived, but I received my work permit after only about a month,\u201d Emelis said.",
      "South Brooklyn Sanctuary was founded in the wake of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s decision to bus over 27,300 migrants to New York, citing the need for border security. Over 8 million migrants have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border since 2020 because of political suppression, gang violence, poverty and natural disasters, many settling in immigrant hubs in large cities that struggled to rapidly expand their safety net. As of 2024, border crossing numbers and new migrant arrivals to New York City and other major metropolitan hubs have declined.",
      "In Brooklyn, Juan Carlos Ruiz, pastor of the Good Shepherd Church, and residents welcomed their new neighbors to a weekly walk-in program with immigration information, hot food and clothes. They soon realized what migrants also needed was knowledge about their rights.",
      "At the time, legal clinics in New York City were overwhelmed by the influx of migrants struggling to find free legal representation. Other cities saw the same. The Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network in Washington, D.C., and Mountain Dreamers in Frisco, Colorado, were just two of the many organizations formed in the absence of local government and nonprofit services helping migrants fill out asylum and employment authorization applications.",
      "In New York, the city\u2019s official asylum center places strict restrictions on who can schedule an asylum application appointment: Migrants must be in the city\u2019s shelter system, eligible for work authorization and not have been in the country for more than 11 months. Meanwhile, many migrants who do get their day in immigration court are unprepared and often appear without legal representation. Nearly 44% of immigrants in New York state are battling their cases alone, Schectman said, and many don\u2019t speak English, know their rights or have any legal training.",
      "\u201cIn the absence of attorney capacity, we want a robust pro se community that can fill that justice gap,\u201d Schectman said.",
      "Preparing for the policy changes ahead",
      "Maria Meneses, 45, is an asylum recipient herself and began volunteering with South Brooklyn Sanctuary last summer to share the advice that had once benefited her.",
      "She sits with asylum applicants and tells them that she understands the traumas they carry with them. Meneses asks them for any proof of violence or abuse to make their case stronger. \u201cI tell them, it might feel embarrassing, but it\u2019s important to show what happened to you,\u201d she said.",
      "Meneses emphasized the importance of asylum-seekers naming the specific gang that threatened them and the towns it operates in. \u201cBecause of high corruption levels, many of these gangs are serious economic and political operations embedded in the government,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can make the case that resisting them leads to government persecution.\u201d",
      "Meneses said that though her personal experience makes her an effective volunteer, it can take a toll on her, too. \u201cThese families put all their dreams into the asylum process,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re forced to recount the most terrible things that have happened to them and the reason why they left everything behind.\u201d",
      "But seeing South Brooklyn Sanctuary\u2019s volunteer pool more than doubled during the past three months gives her hope. \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring to see how New York City people show up to support their community,\u201d she said.",
      "For now, Emelis is building her life in New York. After she was granted a work permit in 2023, she found home attendant work with a temp agency. She\u2019s able to spend time with her son and brothers after her evening shifts. \u201cAll I want is to give my son a better future here,\u201d she said."

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 01:18:24 GMT",
    "summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Allies of former Sen.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Allies of former Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., have approached the White House on his behalf multiple times since the fall to see if President Joe Biden might be willing to pardon him, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Left with the impression that he won\u2019t receive a pardon from Biden, Menendez has now shifted his focus onto President-elect Donald Trump, three people familiar with the discussions said.",
      "Menendez told people close to him even before the November election that he might have a better chance of securing clemency from Trump, two people with direct knowledge of his comments said. And in recent weeks, he has discussed with people close to him whether he might be more successful with Trump if he sought a sentence commutation rather than a full pardon, three people familiar with the discussions said.",
      "Menendez is facing potentially years in prison after he was convicted on federal corruption charges in July, with federal prosecutors last week recommending a sentence of at least 15 years.",
      "Menendez, who pleaded not guilty to the charges, resigned from the Senate in August. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 29. His pursuit of a pardon from the president underscores how concerned the 71-year-old is about spending significant time in prison.",
      "Biden and Menendez, both Democrats and former chairmen of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, are not particularly close. Their relationship has been contentious at times, with disagreements over high-profile issues such as Iran and more recently over Biden\u2019s willingness to move toward Republicans on immigration policies, which Menendez called \u201ctruly shameful.\u201d",
      "Menendez, along with all Senate Democrats, voted to convict Trump during both of his impeachment trials, which the president-elect is unlikely to easily forget, according to a source close to Trump. But two people familiar with the discussions said the former senator has suggested to people close to him that a rejection of a pardon from Biden might make Trump more inclined to grant him clemency.",
      "Menendez declined to comment.",
      "Representatives for the White House and the Trump team did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Longtime Biden adviser Steve Ricchetti, who serves in the White House as counselor to the president, was among those approached about a pardon for Menendez, two people familiar with the discussions said. Ricchetti was noncommittal, they said, but the takeaway for Menendez was that Biden would be unlikely to do it.",
      "Ricchetti declined to comment.",
      "The former senator later tried to gain traction on a pardon from Biden through third-party outreach to other people close to the president, two people familiar with the discussions said.",
      "Menendez has also used emissaries in discussions with the Trump transition team, including Jewish leaders in New Jersey, two people familiar with the discussions said. Menendez was a fierce advocate for Israel during his time in public office and has leveraged his strong ties to the Garden State\u2019s Jewish communities.",
      "As part of his efforts to gain clemency from Trump, Menendez has looked at Trump\u2019s 2020 decision to commute the sentence of former Illinois Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich.",
      "Blagojevich was convicted of corruption charges related to his solicitation of bribes to influence his decision on who would fill Barack Obama\u2019s U.S. Senate seat after he was elected president. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2011.",
      "A jury found Menendez guilty in July on charges that he accepted bribes \u2014 including cash and gold bars \u2014 to benefit the governments of Egypt and Qatar, as well as extortion, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent.",
      "Menendez\u2019s wife, Nadine Menendez, was also charged and pleaded not guilty. She will be tried separately. After the jury verdict, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, whose office prosecuted the case, said that \u201cyears of selling his office to the higher bidder have finally come to an end.\u201d",
      "Trump and his allies have repeatedly claimed he was prosecuted by a weaponized Department of Justice, which two Menendez allies said the former senator could also use to curry favor with the president-elect and argue he too was prosecuted by a corrupt DOJ. They said it could also be used as a justification for Trump if he were to pardon Menendez."

    "story": [
      "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has appointed his lieutenant governor, Jon Husted, to the Senate seat recently vacated by Vice President-elect JD Vance.",
      "\"I have worked with him, I have seen him. I know his knowledge of Ohio. I know his heart. I know what he cares about. I know his skills,\" DeWine said at a Friday news conference from the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus. \"All of that tells me he is the right person for this job.\"",
      "Word of Husted's selection began trickling out Friday morning, after it became clear that DeWine would announce his choice at an afternoon news conference. Signal Ohio first reported that DeWine had settled on Husted, and two sources with knowledge of the decision confirmed it to NBC News.",
      "\"This decision was not made lightly,\" Husted said while standing alongside his wife, Tina, and DeWine. \"My family and I listened to the advice of so many people, including the governor and so many others.\"",
      "Husted\u2019s move has broader ramifications on Ohio\u2019s political landscape, removing him from a long-planned run to succeed the term-limited DeWine as governor in 2026.",
      "It also eases a path for biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who has signaled interest in mounting his own campaign for governor. Ramaswamy took himself out of consideration for the Senate seat last fall, after agreeing to lead President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency alongside billionaire Elon Musk. But Ramaswamy, who lives in the Columbus area, resurfaced as a late contender for the Senate appointment in recent days and met last weekend with DeWine.",
      "\u201cVivek\u2019s base plan remains [the] same,\u201d an Ohio operative familiar with Ramaswamy\u2019s thinking, wrote in a text message. \u201cTo get accomplishments at DOGE and then announce a run for governor shortly.\u201d",
      "Husted, 57, will hold the Senate seat at least through a 2026 special election to fill the remaining two years of Vance\u2019s term. He had recently emerged as a leading contender, though there were questions about whether the post was in line with Husted's personal and political ambitions. DeWine had said appointing someone who could win a competitive Republican primary next year was among his chief considerations.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Husted confirmed that he will run to keep the seat. He said that he had spoken with Trump by phone Friday morning.",
      "\"He congratulated me, and I told him that he could count on me to be an ally,\" Husted said of Trump when asked if he believed he would have his endorsement in a GOP primary. \"He is going to, I think, probably say something more about this next week. That's up to him. I'm not going to speak for him.\"",
      "Husted also said he plans to vote to confirm each of Trump's Cabinet nominees.",
      "\"I think he deserves the team that he wants to lead America, and I'm going to support them,\" he added.",
      "DeWine and Husted discussed the upcoming race for governor and the Senate seat in a meeting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort last month in Florida. Trump at the time made no commitment to endorsing Husted for either post, sources said.",
      "A Trump spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment Friday.",
      "Vance congratulated Husted in a post on X Friday, saying the two had spoken on the phone earlier in the day.",
      "\"Earlier today, I called Jon Husted to congratulate him on his appointment to the United States Senate. Look forward to working with both Jon and Bernie Moreno to Make America Great Again!\" Vance wrote.",
      "While Husted was DeWine\u2019s preferred successor as governor, choosing Husted for the Senate vacancy reduces the risk that he loses a bruising primary to Ramaswamy, who would potentially bring Trump-movement cachet to the race.",
      "And while DeWine\u2019s decision removes a Ramaswamy rival, other prominent Republicans \u2014 including Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and state Treasurer Robert Sprague \u2014 have been preparing their own bids for governor.",
      "\"I was planning on running for governor ... that's what I had been preparing for,\" Husted said in the interview, acknowledging the hard choice to pivot away from a long-held aspiration. \"All of a sudden you have an opportunity to be appointed to the U.S. Senate and work in a Republican Party with Republican president, and so then I paused, and I said, 'You have to think about this.'\"",
      "Husted said would wait to see who all runs for governor before deciding if he will endorse anyone. He noted that he has \"had a long, good relationship with Vivek,\" who informally advised him during the pandemic and served on the board for the Husted-led InnovateOhio agency.",
      "\"I look forward to hearing what his plans are,\" Husted added, referring to Ramaswamy.",
      "Trump is a political force in Ohio, where he has won three times by comfortable margins. He and DeWine were on opposite sides of last year\u2019s GOP primary for the state\u2019s other Senate seat \u2014 a race in which DeWine backed a state lawmaker loathed by much of Trump world over Trump-endorsed businessman Bernie Moreno.",
      "Moreno easily won the primary and went on to unseat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who has not ruled out running in next year\u2019s special election for Vance\u2019s old seat.",
      "Husted, a former Ohio secretary of state and state House speaker, has long been part of the state's GOP establishment. Husted also has been a loyal governing partner for DeWine, who is not always on the same page, politically, as Trump. The governor took flack from the party's right-wing base for his early vigilance and lockdown orders during the pandemic.",
      "\"I've always been a conservative,\" Husted replied when asked how his politics fit in with Trump's. \"I've been for balanced budgets, tax cuts and school choice and Second Amendment rights and less government and returning more power to the states. So those things are all pretty traditional Republican issues that I have been dedicated to, but I also agree with where the president wants to take America and that we want to be strong again, that we want to focus on the needs of the middle-class and working people.\"",
      "DeWine and Husted have been allies since they ran together in 2018. Husted had plans to seek the governorship that year, as well, but he agreed to join DeWine\u2019s ticket as lieutenant governor.",
      "\"Gov. DeWine has seen it all,\" Husted said. \"He's been a U.S. senator. He's been a governor and in many other roles. And so the fact that he has a high opinion of me means a lot to me. But he didn't push me in this direction. Everybody's name who you hear out there would have taken this appointment, but he offered it to me, and I said, yes, but he didn't push.\"",
      "DeWine said Friday that he interviewed \"a large number of people\" for the Senate post and heard from many others interested in the appointment. Though he mentioned no names, others who were in the mix to succeed Vance included Sprague, former state GOP chair Jane Timken, U.S. Rep. Mike Carey and former state Rep. Jay Edwards."

A sixth defendant was being arraigned separately in juvenile court.",

      "A lawyer for Brainard, Christopher Todd, said, \u201cWe\u2019re just looking forward to having the process play out.\u201d The lawyer for Trudeau, Robert Iacovelli, said afterward that she\u2019s innocent.

    "title": "Florida jury convicts CNN of libeling Navy veteran in Afghan story",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 23:10:28 GMT",
    "summary": "Zachary Young blamed CNN for destroying his business by showing his face onscreen in a story about a \u201cblack market\u201d of smuggling out desperate Afghans for high fees.",
    "story": [
      "A Florida jury on Friday found that CNN defamed a U.S. Navy veteran in a 2021 story about people paid to rescue endangered Afghans following the Taliban takeover of that country.",
      "It was an unusual ruling against a media outlet in a defamation case. Libel laws are generally protective of news organizations, and plaintiffs must meet a high standard to prove defamation.",
      "The jury in Panama City, Florida, deliberated for more than eight hours starting Thursday before ruling in favor of Zachary Young, who blamed CNN for destroying his business by showing his face onscreen in a story about a \u201cblack market\u201d of smuggling out desperate Afghans for high fees.",
      "The jury awarded Young $5 million in compensatory damages. An undisclosed settlement was reached later Friday regarding punitive damages, according to the judge overseeing the case. Details of that settlement were not immediately available.",
      "Young had argued that his business targeted sponsors who could afford to pay for Afghans to get out, not individual Afghans charged as much as $10,000 for the service. While CNN said it was wrong to use the phrase \u201cblack market,\u201d it contended that its reporting on Young was accurate.",
      "CNN told The Associated Press that it would have no comment on the verdict. But it sent a statement to the website Mediaite saying: \u201cWe remain proud of our journalists and are 100% committed to strong, fearless and fair-minded reporting at CNN, though we will of course take what useful lessons we can from this case.\u201d",
      "At a trial located in a conservative part of the country, Young\u2019s lawyers urged jurors to send a message to the media. Questions submitted by jurors during the trial telegraphed some hostility, with one wondering whether CNN had treated the plaintiff as guilty until proven innocent.",
      "Private messages also became part of the trial, with plaintiffs showing internal messages where CNN\u2019s reporter, Alex Marquardt, said some profane and unflattering things about Young. Marquardt testified in the trial that his story \u201cwas not a hit piece.\u201d",
      "Marquardt\u2019s story first aired on Nov. 11, 2021, during Jake Tapper\u2019s CNN broadcast, and subsequent printed stories were used on the network\u2019s website.",
      "Defamation trials are actually rare in the United States, in part because the strong constitutional protections for the press make proving libel difficult. From the media\u2019s standpoint, taking a case to a judge or jury is a risk many executives don\u2019t want to take.",
      "Rather than defend statements that George Stephanopoulos made about Trump last spring, ABC News last month\u00a0agreed to make the former president\u2019s libel lawsuit go away\u00a0by paying him $15 million toward his presidential library. In the end, ABC parent Walt Disney Co. concluded an ongoing fight against Trump wasn\u2019t worth it, win or lose.",
      "In another case, Fox News\u00a0agreed to pay\u00a0Dominion Voting Systems $787 million on the day the trial was due to start in 2023 to settle the company\u2019s claims of inaccurate reporting in the wake of the 2020 presidential election."

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 04:11:33 GMT",
    "summary": "About 1,500 people were instructed to leave Moss Landing and the Elkhorn Slough area.",
    "story": [
      "Evacuations were lifted Friday night for people near an ongoing fire that erupted Thursday at one of the world\u2019s largest battery storage plants in the northern half of California.",
      "Video circulating on social media showed smoke and flames erupting from the Moss Landing Power Plant on Thursday night in the Monterey County community of Moss Landing, about 25 miles south of Santa Cruz.",
      "The Monterey County Sheriff's Office\u00a0said Friday evening that evacuation orders for as many as 1,500 people were lifted, but residents were told to stay indoors in case the fire pollutes the air with toxic gasses.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency said testing determined the air was not a threat for now, according to a statement from the County of Monterey Department of Emergency Management.",
      "Speaking at an afternoon news conference, Monterey County Supervisor Glenn Church and California Assembly Member Dawn Addis expressed their wish to keep the storage facility offline until investigators can determine the cause of the fire.",
      "Addis said it's been determined that allowing the fire to burn out is the safest way to move forward. A spokesperson for the plant concurred.",
      "The plant is owned by Texas-company Vistra Corp and contains tens of thousands of lithium batteries, which are important for storing electricity from such renewable energy sources as solar energy, but can be extremely difficult to put out if they go up in flames.",
      "Vistra said in a statement in 2021 that the newer, storage side of the plant, which was initially developed in 1950 as a Pacific Gas & Electric fossil fuel based power facility, can handle 400 megawatts or 1,600 megawatt-hours of electricity, which comes from renewable energy and can be released to the California power grid when needed.",
      "Battery storage is crucial to a future that could depend on renewable energy such as solar power, which is drawn from peak daylight hours but needed day and night, rain or shine.",
      "The North County\u00a0Fire Protection\u00a0District Fire received a call around 3 p.m. Thursday about the fire at the plant, according to Chief Joel Mendoza, who spoke at a news briefing Friday morning.",
      "\u201cOur first unit on scene arrived and found that there was smoke out of the building and we did find at least one battery on fire,\u201d Mendoza said.",
      "About an hour into the fire, \u201cconditions changed drastically\u201d and a fire suppression system in the facility that has worked well in past incidents was not proving to be helpful.",
      "\u201cIn this particular case, that system was not sufficient, it was overridden, and that led to fire overtaking the system and eventually overtaking the entire building,\u201d Mendoza said.",
      "It was then that a mandatory evacuation for the area was issued, and surrounding roadways were closed. Around 1,200 to 1,500 residents were evacuated safely from about 7,600 acres of land, according to Monterey County Communications Director Nick Pasculli, who also spoke at the briefing Friday.",
      "No injuries or deaths have been reported as a result of the fire, Pasculli said.",
      "Mendoza reported that \u201cmost of that fire has gone out,\u201d and that there is very little active flame left. The peak of the fire seemed to be between 8 and 10 p.m. Thursday, he added.",
      "Hydrogen fluoride, the primary toxic gas released when lithium batteries burn, was not detected by monitors used to track air quality on the scene, Mendoza said, emphasizing that this is based on a preliminary report.",
      "In an update shared Friday morning, the Santa Cruz County Office of Response, Recovery and Resilience said the fire poses no imminent significant threat and that people can resume normal activities.",
      "\"Sensitive groups including those with respiratory difficulties should continue monitoring local air conditions,\" the county said in the update posted on X. \"While home, we recommend keeping doors and windows closed until further notice, especially residents who live closest to the fire.\"",
      "During the briefing, Monterey County District 2 Supervisor Glenn Church described the fire \"as a worst case scenario of a disaster\" that nobody predicted.",
      "\u201cThis is really a lot more than just a fire, it\u2019s really a wake up call for this industry, and if we\u2019re going to be moving ahead with sustainable energy we need to have safe battery systems in place,\" Church said.",
      "Church said this is the fourth fire that has happened at this site since 2019, adding that a transition to sustainable energy should not come before safety and the environment.",
      "The cause of the fire is not known at this time, but Church promised accountability.",
      "\u201cThere must be accountability for this, and there will be accountability,\u201d he said.",
      "There were fires at the Vistra plant in 2021 and 2022 that were caused by a fire sprinkler system malfunction that resulted in some units overheating, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Vistra Director of Community Affairs Brad Watson apologized on behalf of the company in the news briefing on Friday.",
      "\"Our company takes very seriously what happened last night and we are hurting today, because we know primarily its impacted and disrupted the people who live around our site \u2014 our neighbors, our friends and businesses.\"",
      "Watson said Vistra has arranged for an outside consultant to monitor air quality in the area. He said an investigation of the cause was expected.",
      "North Monterey County Unified School District announced that all schools and offices would be closed Friday due to the fire. California State University Monterey Bay also said classes at its Moss Landing campus were closed until further notice."

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "China hacking threat",
    "story": [
      "As President-elect Donald Trump enters his second term Monday, he\u2019s facing down an unprecedented foreign threat: Chinese hackers.",
      "In the last several years, three distinct Chinese hacking campaigns have occurred in the United States \u2014 even reportedly infiltrating U.S. government computers belonging to top Biden administration officials.",
      "While China has long been a top cyber adversary for the U.S., over the course of the Biden administration it has become more dogged and ambitious than ever before, experts and U.S. officials say, building to what has become perhaps the biggest cyber challenge the U.S. has faced to date.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that the risk of Chinese cyberattacks has gone up,\u201d said Adam Segal, who served as a senior cybersecurity adviser in the State Department last year. \u201cAnd Chinese capabilities have seemed to have notably increased over the last four years.\u201d",
      "The most recent breach, discovered in December, gave the hackers access to files from the Treasury Department. The department described the breach as a \u201cmajor incident\u201d and sanctioned a Chinese company for allegedly helping that country\u2019s cyber programs. Another, called Salt Typhoon, included a massive compromise of telecommunications companies, including AT&T and Verizon, and gave the hackers access to the Trump and Harris campaigns\u2019 phone calls last year, as well as the phone records of more than a million Americans. FBI Director Christopher Wray said last month it may prove to be the \u201cmost significant cyber espionage campaign in history.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the biggest threat, known as Volt Typhoon, consists of hackers stealthily burrowing into infrastructure, including power, communications and water facilities. In a marked departure from other alleged Chinese hacking campaigns, which generally seem designed to collect intelligence, U.S. officials say Volt Typhoon is pre-positioning in case of military conflict \u2014 particularly if China were to invade the self-ruling island of Taiwan \u2014 to cause mass chaos and hamper the U.S. from conducting a full and immediate response.",
      "While AT&T and Verizon say they have worked to clear the hackers from their systems, White House officials have said that both the Salt and Volt Typhoon hacks should be considered perpetual operations and that the hackers are unlikely to give up trying to get back in. China has denied being behind all three hacking campaigns.",
      "As the Biden administration prepares to depart the White House, there are indications that the government realizes it has not done enough to stop China-backed hackers.",
      "On Thursday, in one of his final official acts as president, Joe Biden signed an executive order that largely tackles cybersecurity problems, including giving the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency more power to monitor federal networks for hackers.",
      "According to a memo published on Jan. 6 by the Southern Nevada Counter Terrorism Center \u2014 one of dozens of fusion centers across the U.S. that share law enforcement and intelligence information \u2014 senators received multiple briefings on Salt Typhoon last month. The memo, seen by NBC News, is unclassified but marked for official use only, and was provided to NBC News by Property of the People, a nonprofit that uses freedom of information requests to obtain hidden government documents.",
      "In at least one of those briefings, private experts told senators that countering China would require both hardening U.S. telephone networks \u2014 a massive investment \u2014 and beginning \u201ca sustained, direct, and more forceful effort to disincentivize Chinese espionage.\u201d One expert suggested the U.S. create a \u201ccredible threat of painful retaliation\u201d for such campaigns.",
      "Trump\u2019s incoming team has said it plans to be more confrontational and aggressive against China.",
      "\u201cFor too long our country has been on defense when it comes to cyberattacks,\u201d Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance transition spokesperson, told NBC News in an emailed statement.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to imposing costs on private and nation state actors who continue to steal our data and attack our infrastructure,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., told CBS News last month that the next administration would take \u201ca different approach to cyber.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to start going on offense and start imposing, I think, higher costs and consequences to private actors and nation state actors that continue to steal our data, that continue to spy on us, and that even worse, with the Volt Typhoon penetration, that are literally putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "Waltz declined in the interview to say whether that could include sanctions, and did not otherwise describe what such deterrence might mean.",
      "During his first term, Trump eliminated the federal government\u2019s cybersecurity czar, a move that attracted intense criticism from Democrats. Experts praised the Biden administration\u2019s cyber policies, despite what appeared to be steeply escalating issues affecting citizens and the government itself.",
      "Chris Painter, the top cyber diplomat during the Obama administration, said it was clear that China\u2019s cyber activity is not being deterred, but that it isn\u2019t clear how the Trump administration\u2019s approach would fix that.",
      "\u201cThere has been a lot of activity over the years, both in the Trump administration and this administration, but it hasn\u2019t protected us from these massive events. They\u2019re going to have to take this seriously,\u201d he said.",
      "Vulnerabilities in private companies, like those exploited to give hackers access to American telecoms, are \u201can enduring problem\u201d that Biden\u2019s team tried to address with regulations that are unlikely to last under Trump, Painter said. Trump campaigned on the \u201cmost aggressive regulatory reduction\u201d and has vowed to sign a flurry of executive orders on his first day in office, many overturning Biden policies.",
      "\u201cSo how do you cure that? The Biden administration, for the first time in years, has moved to this idea in the national cyber strategy that maybe it\u2019s time to think about the dirty word of regulation and have more responsibility. I think that\u2019s out the window in the new administration.\u201d",
      "Segal, the former Biden official, said the U.S. won\u2019t be able to convince China to stop conducting cyber espionage, especially given the United States\u2019 own long history of that practice.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very little that can be done or said to China about espionage,\u201d Segal told NBC News. \u201cCountries are going to commit espionage and then continue committing espionage, and so really it\u2019s on us to better defend ourselves.\u201d",
      "The Biden White House has conducted operations to disrupt China\u2019s hacking infrastructure, same as it does with other hackers adversarial to the U.S. On Tuesday, the Justice Department and the FBI announced they had removed a type of malware that China has used to infect Americans\u2019 computers to unwittingly do Beijing\u2019s bidding.",
      "Most of the operations that the U.S. Cyber Command conducts, including disrupting Chinese hacking operations, are classified, making it impossible to fully judge their effectiveness. But it\u2019s not clear that simply disrupting that kind of hacker infrastructure is an effective long-term plan, said Brandon Wales, the executive director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cOffensive cyber operations can complicate adversary planning and disrupt operational infrastructure, but we have seen both nation-state and criminal organizations reconstitute that infrastructure relatively quickly,\u201d Wales, now the vice president for cybersecurity strategy at cybersecurity company SentinelOne, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhere the U.S. government has its best access to Chinese networks, do we want to burn those on operations now or save those for conflict when they could mean the difference between life and death?\u201d he said."

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Since two gene therapies were approved for sickle cell disease in late 2023, only a handful of patients have started the expensive treatments.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 For Wedam Minyila, hospital rooms have always meant blinding pain. \u201cLike someone is jamming a knife in me,\u201d he said.",
      "But for a brief moment on a recent December morning, Wedam, 19, who has sickle cell disease, allowed himself to believe what his doctors had been telling him for months: This visit could be the first step to a cure. As one of the first patients in the world to undergo commercial treatment for the genetic condition, he could start imagining a future free of excruciating pain.",
      "\u201cI choose to partially believe it,\u201d he said the day he was admitted to Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., for his stem cell collection \u2014 the first major step of the revolutionary sickle cell gene therapy process. \u201cBut that also comes with the skepticism of: Will it really work?\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the same question sickle cell patients nationwide have been asking since the Food and Drug Administration approved two gene therapies that could cure the symptoms of the disease just over a year ago.",
      "Since then, only a few dozen patients nationwide have been able to access it. Paperwork snarls, a multimillion-dollar price tag and patient concerns over serious side effects mean only a limited number of hospitals have treated patients so far.",
      "More than 100,000 people in the United States \u2014 9 in 10 of them Black \u2014 have sickle cell disease. The inherited illness causes red blood cells, usually round, to contort into a crescent, or sickle, shape. The sickle-shaped cells often pile up in blood vessels, resulting in excruciating pain, strokes, damage to organs and shorter lives. The new gene therapies, one from Boston-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the other from Somerville, Massachusetts-based Bluebird Bio, offer a potential cure.",
      "That\u2019s why Wedam pushed past his skepticism \u2014 and worked through months of insurance approvals and medical consultations.",
      "\u201cI know what it can mean for me,\u201d he said quietly as a team of medical professionals began swarming his bedside. \u201cBut until it happens, I\u2019m not really as excited as everybody else.\u201d",
      "His mom, Sylvia, watched from the corner of the room, holding her breath. \u201cThis is a brand-new thing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I never thought that, you know, we would be one of the pacesetters for this. It feels unreal.\u201d",
      "But the first step of what she describes as her \u201cmiracle\u201d was happening before her eyes: Nurses gave her son a medication to mobilize stem cells normally trapped inside the bone marrow to flow into the bloodstream. A couple of hours later, Wedam was hooked up to what\u2019s known as an apheresis machine, which draws blood out of the body and then spins it at high speeds to separate out the millions of stem cells before it returns the rest of blood back into the veins.",
      "Dr. Andrew Campell stepped to Wedam\u2019s bedside as the first of the light orange liquid containing his stem cells began collecting in an IV bag hanging next to him.",
      "\u201cYou are one of the few in the country and even in the world, you know, taking this big step \u2014\u00a0 gene therapy,\u201d said Campbell, director of the hospital\u2019s Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease Program. \u201cIt took a lot of bravery, because I know this is still very new in the process.\u201d",
      "Wedam looked unfazed. \u201cI had to,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not something I could really pass up. So I didn\u2019t really have a choice.\u201d",
      "A learning curve for hospitals",
      "In coming months, Wedam\u2019s cells will be shipped to a lab in Tennessee, where technicians will use a gene-editing tool called CRISPR to modify a gene in the stem cells so they produce red blood cells that are less likely to sickle and block blood flow, resulting in pain crises.",
      "Wedam will need intensive chemotherapy to wipe out his existing stem cells and make room in his bone marrow for the gene-edited cells, which a team at Children\u2019s National Hospital will reintroduce into his bloodstream intravenously.",
      "\u201cTo be able to deliver a therapy that is a cure and is going to keep him out of the hospital and is likely going to extend life, this is amazing,\u201d said Dr. David Jacobsohn, Children\u2019s National\u2019s chief of blood and marrow transplantation. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very powerful what we\u2019re able to provide now compared to five or 10 years ago.\u201d",
      "Even so, Jacobsohn acknowledged few patients have begun the gene therapy treatment. At Children\u2019s National \u2014 which was ahead of the curve after it participated in Bluebird Bio\u2019s clinical trials \u2014 only 10 people, including Wedam, have initiated or finished the process. That\u2019s out of a pool of about 1,500 patients with sickle cell disease that the team treats in the Washington area.",
      "\u201cAt first, leadership in the hospital, they were super excited. They said: \u2018We have dozens and dozens of patients eligible. We need to build more beds!\u2019 And my feeling is eventually we will, but it\u2019s not going to happen right away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a learning curve for the hospitals, and it\u2019s been a learning curve for the insurance companies.\u201d",
      "Jacobsohn said his team is ramping up to start one or two patients on the treatment per month\u00a0 \u2014 a pace he called \u201cexciting.\u201d",
      "\u201cRemember, this is a very high-risk treatment requiring high-dose chemotherapy with potential for complications,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not something that we would want to ramp up too rapidly.\u201d",
      "The monthslong treatment Casgevy from Vertex Pharmaceuticals comes with a list price of $2.3 million. Bluebird Bio\u2019s Lyfgenia is listed at $3.1 million. Neither includes the cost of care to stay in the hospital or for chemotherapy.",
      "To manage the hefty price tag, insurers have implemented extensive pre-authorization procedures. Both drug companies told NBC News they have yet to see an \u201cultimate denial\u201d for their drugs.",
      "The procedure is resource-intensive for the limited number of hospitals authorized to deliver it,\u00a0requiring multiple days in the hospital for the stem cell collection and, months later, multiweek hospital stays for chemotherapy and the reintroduction of the stem cells, Jacobsohn said. In between, the stem cell processing lab needs several months to genetically alter the cells and perform safety checks before it sends them back to the hospital for infusion.",
      "For patients like Wedam, there are other considerations, too. The intensive chemotherapy lasts four days and makes patients extremely ill and susceptible to infection. Many develop ulcerating sores in their mouths, throats and esophagi that make eating nearly impossible. Longer-term, the chemotherapy raises the risk of cancer and infertility.",
      "For all of those reasons, only a single patient has completed the process at City of Hope Children\u2019s Cancer Center in Los Angeles. Dr. Leo Wang, a pediatric hematologist-oncologist at the center, says he expects that number to rise rapidly in coming months after the \u201cearly adopters\u201d start showing success.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that uptake will increase and become more acceptable to people who are maybe a little bit more risk-averse,\u201d Wang said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve already seen that where we\u2019ll have patients come and ask us about it and say, \u2018Well, I\u2019d really like to talk to somebody who\u2019s been through this already and get their perspective, and then maybe I\u2019ll be interested in doing that.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u2018God, you did this for me\u2019",
      "That\u2019s one of Wedam\u2019s motivations for becoming an \u201cearly adopter.\u201d \u201cIf all of those people could see me and see that it works, they\u2019ll have some hope,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a tiny bit.\u201d",
      "The disease has robbed him of his ability to do much of anything, including getting out of bed. But the idea of a cure has him dreaming of some day becoming a filmmaker.",
      "Near-term, his ambitions are much smaller \u2014 he\u2019d like to attend his college classes in person instead of online.",
      "\u201cNow, I don\u2019t really keep up with most of my friends, so I\u2019d be able to make new ones,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be able to learn the material better if I\u2019m in person, asking the teacher actual questions. I just think, being a normal person, doing what a normal person would, I think that is what really excites me.\u201d",
      "The disease ravaged the Minyila family for close to two decades. In addition to Wedam, his 14-year-old brother, Wekem, also has sickle cell.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taken almost everything,\u201d Sylvia Minyila said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken our joy.\u201d",
      "Wedam, she said, was once a happy boy who loved school and dancing. But once his pain crises started around middle school, she said, he changed.",
      "\u201cHe became withdrawn. Anywhere there was bone, he could have pain there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnywhere in the house you were, you could hear him moaning. And this is something that I used to think about regularly: \u2018Am I going to lose him?\u2019 Because he was in so much pain.\u201d",
      "Until the gene therapy, the only cure for sickle cell disease was a stem cell transplant from a donor. That worked for Wekem after Sylvia discovered she was a match for her younger son. After some scary complications, the procedure was successful.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 22:55:05 GMT",
    "summary": "Justin Baldoni filed a $400 million lawsuit against \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, on Jan. 16. Here's a look at some of the allegations.",
    "story": [
      "\"It Ends With Us\" director and actor Justin Baldoni filed a lawsuit on Thursday against his co-star Blake Lively, adding another layer to the legal saga between the pair that began in December.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, an \"It Ends With Us\" LLC, producer Jamey Heath and PR pros Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel filed a 179-page complaint in a U.S. district court in New York on Jan. 16, accusing Lively; her husband, Ryan Reynolds; her PR person Leslie Sloane; and Sloane's business of defamation and other contractual claims.",
      "\"Heartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\" attorneys for Baldoni write in the complaint.",
      "Lively's legal team responded to the filing, calling the lawsuit \"another chapter in the abuser playbook\" in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\"This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim,\" the statement continued.",
      "Lively's legal team said Baldoni and Wayfarer \"are trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni. The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony\u2019s cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\"",
      "The statement concluded by saying \"the strategy of attacking the woman is desperate, it does not refute the evidence in Ms. Lively\u2019s complaint, and it will fail.\"",
      "Lively previously filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni in California and a lawsuit against him in New York. Baldoni has denied Lively's allegations against him.",
      "Baldoni is seeking damages of at least $400 million for defamation, civil extortion, false light invasion of privacy, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional interference with contractual relations, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage\u00a0and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, said in a statement to TODAY.com that the lawsuit was \"a legal action based on an overwhelming amount of untampered evidence detailing Blake Lively and her team\u2019s duplicitous attempt to destroy Justin Baldoni, his team and their respective companies by disseminating grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret. Blake Lively was either severely misled by her team or intentionally and knowingly misrepresented the truth,\" he said.",
      "\"Ms. Lively will never again be allowed to continue to exploit actual victims of real harassment solely for her personal reputation gain at the expense of those without power,\" he continued. \"Let\u2019s not forget, Ms. Lively and her team attempted to bulldoze reputations and livelihoods for heinously selfish reasons through their own dangerous manipulation of the media before even taking any actual legal action. We know the truth, and now the public does too. Justin and his team have nothing to hide, documents do not lie.\"",
      "Here\u2019s what Baldoni accuses Lively of in the complaint related to allegations of \u201cbreach of contract, extortion, defamation and further wrongdoing.\u201d",
      "Baldoni says Lively insisted on oversight of her character\u2019s costume",
      "Lively, who was hired as an actor to play Lily Bloom in the film, allegedly insisted on control over her character's costume before filming even began, according to the complaint.",
      "Baldoni alleges that Lively's actions led the costume designer to re-shop her wardrobe, \"far exceeding the allocated budget and diverting time and resources, while also preparing wardrobes for the rest of the cast,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Lively spoke about her involvement with the costumes during the press tour for the film, including with TODAY's Sheinelle Jones.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s storytelling,\u201d she said on TODAY. \u201cTo me, fashion and costume design is storytelling.\u201d",
      "Lively wrote a draft of the rooftop scene, then said Reynolds wrote it at the film's premiere, lawsuit says",
      "During production, Lively asked Baldoni if she could \"take a pass\" at writing one of the scenes in the film, where Lily and Baldoni's character, Ryle, meet on the rooftop of his apartment building, the complaint states.",
      "Baldoni alleges the draft of the scene Lively wrote significantly differed from the original version, and that he thanked her for her passion and said that the final scene would likely end up being somewhere between her version and the original version.",
      "Lively did not respond and went silent for multiple days afterward, according to the complaint.",
      "In text messages, Lively referred to a meeting she called at her penthouse, in which Reynolds greeted Baldoni and gave his wife praise for her version of the scene, the complaint says.",
      "\"Hours later, as the meeting was ending, a famous, and famously close, friend of Reynolds and Lively, walked into the room and similarly began praising Lively\u2019s script,\" the complaint says. \"Baldoni understood the subtext: he needed to comply with Lively\u2019s direction for the script.\"",
      "In one of the messages, Baldoni refers to the friend as \"Taylor,\" but the name is redacted in other messages. (Baldoni's team confirmed this was a reference to Taylor Swift; the pop star has not commented.)",
      "Lively\u2019s complaint did not have details on this specific alleged meeting.",
      "Later, during a red carpet interview, Lively said her husband had written the scene, according to the complaint.",
      "\"This was also the first time that Plaintiffs learned that Reynolds \u2014 who had no formal role whatsoever in the Film\u2019s production \u2014 had made unauthorized changes to the script in secret,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "Baldoni explains why he asked for Lively's weight",
      "Lively introduced Baldoni to the person who would become his personal trainer, according to the complaint.",
      "During production, Baldoni privately reached out to the trainer to ask what Lively's weight was so that he could properly prepare his back muscles for a scene in which he had to lift her up, according to the complaint. (Baldoni has suffered from lifelong back injuries, according to the complaint.)",
      "The next day, Lively asked Baldoni to come to her penthouse, where he was greeted by Reynolds, who swore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cHow dare you f------- ask about my wife\u2019s weight?\" Reynolds asked Baldoni, according to the complaint. \"What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d",
      "Baldoni offered what are described in the lawsuit as \u201crepeated (and completely unwarranted)\u201d apologies, and Reynolds demanded that the scene be removed entirely, according to his complaint. Lively allegedly refused to perform the scene, even after it was rehearsed with a stunt double, according to the complaint.",
      "In Lively\u2019s original complaint, she alleges that weeks after she gave birth to her fourth child, Baldoni \u201csecretly called her fitness trainer without her knowledge or permission and implied that he wanted her to lose weight in two weeks\u201d because he was concerned about picking her up in a scene. She said in her complaint that \"there was no such scene.\"",
      "Later, according to Baldoni's complaint, Lively delivered an ultimatum: \"If Baldoni could not get on board with her work methods, he had two weeks to recast her.\"",
      "Baldoni's attorneys say a 17-point document brought by Lively was 'essentially signed under duress'",
      "After filming was paused due to multiple strikes, production was set to begin again once the SAG-AFTRA strike ended, according to the complaint.",
      "\"The same day that the SAG-AFTRA strike ended, Baldoni, the studios, and producers were eager to resume production. Instead, they were met with an email from Lively\u2019s lawyer, who sent Wayfarer an unsettling and unexpected 17-point list of non-negotiable conditions that must be met before Lively would return to work,\" the complaint states.",
      "\"The stunning list was drafted for the apparent purpose of insinuating or outright claiming that Baldoni, Heath, and others had engaged in sexually inappropriate conduct during filming,\" the complaint continues.",
      "In Lively\u2019s complaint, she also includes details on the meeting, saying it was to discuss \u201cthe inappropriate conduct that Ms. Lively, her employees and other cast and crew experienced at the hands of Mr. Baldoni and Mr. Heath.\u201d Her complaint included the list\u00a0she says was reviewed at the meeting.",
      "In the list, Lively suggested that there wasn't an intimacy coordinator on set, but attorneys for Baldoni write that there was one assigned to the film.",
      "The complaint alleges that Lively didn't meet with the intimacy coordinator, leading Baldoni to work on scenes with the coordinator and relay any changes to Lively.",
      "Baldoni accuses Lively of unchoreographed kissing during scenes, while one of the 17 points on Lively's list was \"no spontaneous improvisation\" during intimate scenes.",
      "Before returning to production, Lively allegedly had more notes and script changes that Baldoni eventually mostly agreed to, out of fear the film would be taken from him by \"threats and coercion,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni write that the document was \u201cessentially signed under duress,\u201d and in an email to his team, Baldoni wrote that he was \u201cwaiving the white flag and submitting\u201d and that he would give Lively \u201c98% of what she wants.\u201d",
      "Baldoni says Lively refused to promote the film if she didn\u2019t get her own cuts, replaced film editors with her own",
      "In April and May 2024, Lively was granted her own cut of the film after Sony told Wayfarer that Lively would refuse to promote the film unless her demands were met, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cUltimately, Lively replaced the Film\u2019s editors with her own choice: an editor often used by Reynolds, and the Film\u2019s editors had to be let go,\u201d the complaint states.",
      "As there were two versions of the film, Lively's cut and Baldoni's cut, the studio agreed to do an official audience test of both versions, according to the complaint. Baldoni's version \"scored significantly higher with key audience demographics,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Lively then said Hoover would not promote the film unless her version was released, and Sony later told Wayfarer that neither Lively nor any of the film's cast would promote the film unless her cut was used.",
      "As noted previously, Lively specified in her response to Baldoni\u2019s lawsuit that \u201cSony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony\u2019s cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\u201d",
      "\"Baldoni was forced to choose between killing the film and his own career by insisting on his own creative vision and rights, or putting out a version of the Film that Baldoni knew could still be so important to domestic violence survivors, even if it differed greatly from what it could have been,\" the complaint states. \"Baldoni reluctantly chose the latter, and stood down, allowing Lively\u2019s version of the Film to be released and promoted.\"",
      "The film went on to bring in over $148 million at the box office throughout its theatrical run.",
      "Baldoni alleges he was kept apart from Lively at the film's premiere",
      "The lawsuit contends that Lively communicated that she would not promote the movie if she was not given a producer credit.",
      "Baldoni and Wayfarer also allege they sent a letter to the Producers Guild of America \"under duress\" asking for Lively to be given a \"coveted\" p.g.a. designation on her producer's credit even though they didn't believe she deserved it.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni write in the lawsuit that he was in Sweden for his wife's birthday when he was informed that Lively and a \"majority of the cast\" would boycott the \"It Ends with Us\" premiere if Baldoni attended it.",
      "A compromise was reached in which \"Wayfarer persuaded Lively to 'permit' Baldoni and the Wayfarer team, along with their friends and family, to attend\" the premiere, according to court documents. Baldoni and his family and friends then attended under \"demeaning and humiliating conditions,\" per the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Baldoni had to cut his time on the red carpet short at the event and was \"instructed to stop immediately\" because Lively was on her way.",
      "The court documents include photos of Baldoni with friends and family on folding chairs and surrounded by pallets of soda bottles. Baldoni's attorneys say the photos are from the basement of the venue, where Baldoni and his entourage were allegedly moved to be separate from the remainder of the cast at the premiere.",
      "The group was then escorted out of the building by security to \"avoid even a chance of interaction with Lively or her guests,\" his complaint says.",
      "Baldoni and Wayfarer also allege that they had to organize and pay for a separate after-party for \"himself and the Wayfarer team\" because he was excluded from the official after-party attended by Lively and the cast. He alleges Wayfarer paid for both parties.",
      "Baldoni's attorneys also allege that he was not invited to any events involving cast members, such as photo shoots, screenings and promotional events, according to court documents.",
      "Baldoni alleges the cast was 'induced' by Lively to shun him, unfollow him on social media",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Lively \"induced\" other cast members to avoid Baldoni \"in an early attempt to give fans the impression that Baldoni had committed an egregious sin, something so egregious that no one wanted to even take photos with him or have him around.\u201d Lively\u2019s response to his lawsuit says that \u201ccast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer.\u201d",
      "His attorneys also write that Lively told Sony that she and the cast would not take part in any promotion of the film with Baldoni present, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit also alleges she ordered him to be removed from all artwork promoting the film, including the posters.",
      "Baldoni's attorneys allege that Lively used tactics like unfollowing him on social media as \"crumbs,\" to give fans \"just enough to allow them to come to their own conclusions\" about him, according to court documents.",
      "The court documents include alleged screenshots of a friendly and complimentary text message exchange between Baldoni and actor Isabela Ferrer, who plays a younger version of Lively's character in the movie. The lawsuit asserts that Lively then turned Ferrer against him.",
      "\u201cIt was not until Ferrer spent substantial time with Lively during film promotions that Ferrer felt compelled to shun Baldoni in repudiation of her warm words,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "Ryan Reynolds allegedly told an executive at Baldoni's agency to 'drop' him",
      "Baldoni and Wayfarer allege in the lawsuit that Reynolds told an executive at William Morris Endeavor to get rid of Baldoni as a client.",
      "They allege the first meeting with the executive took place at the premiere of \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" the blockbuster 2024 film starring Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.",
      "Reynolds allegedly approached a WME executive and \u201cexpressed his deep disdain for Baldoni, suggesting the agency was working with a 'sexual predator'\" and, at a later date, \"demanded that the agent 'drop' Baldoni,\" court documents say.",
      "These allegations were also included in Baldoni\u2019s lawsuit against the New York Times, and WME denied having had any of the alleged conversations.",
      "\u201cIn Baldoni\u2019s filing there is a claim that Reynolds pressured Baldoni\u2019s agent at the\u00a0\u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019\u00a0premiere. This is not true,\u201d WME said in a statement to\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter.",
      "On Dec. 21,\u00a0The New York Times published\u00a0an investigative report about Baldoni\u2019s alleged PR campaign against Lively. After the article was published, WME stopped representing Baldoni, Ari Emanuel, chief executive of the agency\u2019s parent company, Endeavor, told the Times.",
      "Lively allegedly demanded Wayfarer and Baldoni put out a statement 'accepting blame' or 'the gloves would come off'",
      "Baldoni's attorneys allege in the court documents that when word of troubles involving the promotion of the movie began surfacing in the media, Lively and Reynolds wanted Wayfarer, Baldoni and Heath to make a public apology in August 2024.",
      "If they did not, they were told the \"gloves would come off\" from Lively and Reynolds.",
      "\"They told Heath that Lively and Reynolds had demanded that Wayfarer put out a statement 'accepting blame' for the problems during filming, with an express threat that they themselves would attack Wayfarer in the press if Wayfarer refused,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "Baldoni and Wayfarer did not issue any such statement.",
      "Blake Lively's team allegedly worked to smear Baldoni",
      "A portion of the lawsuit echoes the allegations Baldoni has made in a separate $250 million libel lawsuit he filed against The New York Times in late December 2024.",
      "The\u00a0New York Times story\u00a0published on Dec. 21 includes text messages and emails between public relations experts working for Baldoni that allegedly suggest Lively was the target of a smear campaign. Baldoni's attorneys contend it was the opposite \u2014 Lively started a push to smear him.",
      "The Times story was published the day after Lively filed a\u00a0sexual harassment complaint\u00a0against Baldoni with the California Civil Rights Department, saying he repeatedly harassed her on the set of the film and crossed boundaries during intimate scenes.",
      "In Baldoni's lawsuit against Lively, he alleges that she and her team worked in \"close coordination\" with The New York Times, \"likely over a matter of months.\" He alleges that she provided the newspaper with a copy of her sexual harassment complaint \"long before filing it.\"",
      "\"Lively and her team used cherry-picked text messages, stripped of context and even manipulated, to peddle a narrative that Plaintiffs had responded to Lively\u2019s complaints about purported sexual harassment by plotting to destroy her reputation through a shadow smear campaign,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "\u201cThe allegations against The New York Times in this new lawsuit are meritless and recycled from the equally baseless claims in the suit that was filed against The Times in California,\" a New York Times spokesperson said on Jan. 16.",
      "Baldoni's attorneys allege that any backlash against Lively during the promotion of the movie was due to her own social media missteps, like promoting her alcohol brand alongside a movie involving domestic violence and her \"bubbly, sunny messaging\" about a film depicting serious issues.",
      "Her reaction to the negative press was to shift blame to Baldoni, his attorneys allege in the lawsuit.",
      "\"Lively ordered her team to begin a campaign to frame herself as a martyr and pin the blame on Plaintiffs,\" the lawsuit reads. \"Behind the scenes, Lively\u2019s publicist, Leslie Sloane, devised and executed a smear campaign of her own against Baldoni.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges Sloane engaged with a reporter with the Daily Mail and began \"seeding false information to cast Baldoni in a negative light.\"",
      "NBC News reached out to Sloane for comment but did not receive a response."

      "Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham, filed a 81-page federal lawsuit Jan. 15 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which was obtained by TODAY.com.",

      "Read on to learn more about Drake\u2019s federal lawsuit against his own record label.",
      "Why is Drake suing his record label, Universal Music Group?",
      "Drake filed a federal lawsuit against his record label, UMG, on Jan. 15 alleging that the company helped to spread a \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d narrative about him by promoting and releasing his rap rival Kendrick Lamar\u2019s diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",

      "The suit also details several violent break-in attempts at Drake\u2019s Toronto home that he and his legal team believe were \u201cproximately caused by\u201d the lyrics of \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe lyrics repeatedly accuse Drake of engaging in criminal acts, including by calling him a \u2018certified pedophile[]\u2019 and a \u2018predator\u2019 who needs to be \u2018placed on neighborhood watch,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit states.",

      "Drake\u2019s legal team previously filed a petition in November, which was later withdrawn on Jan. 14, accusing UMG of using payola and bots to boost the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on Spotify. The new lawsuit, however, does include similar messaging and repeats some of the same claims.",

      "\u201cWe employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Spotify declined to comment to NBC News at the time of Drake\u2019s complaint. The music streaming service, however, does note on their website that artificial streaming is a major issue and they strictly prohibit \u201cusing any third party service that promises streams or playlist placement in exchange for money.\u201d",
      "How has UMG responded to Drake's lawsuit?",
      "UMG responded to Drake\u2019s lawsuit in a statement on Jan. 15., saying the claims were \u201cuntrue\u201d and the idea that the label would want to \u201charm\u201d any of its artists is \u201cillogical.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have invested massively in his music and our employees around the world have worked tirelessly for many years to help him achieve historic commercial and personal financial success,\u201d the label said.",
      "\u201cThroughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth \u2018rap battles\u2019 to express his feelings about other artists. He now seeks to weaponize the legal process to silence an artist\u2019s creative expression and to seek damages from UMG for distributing that artist\u2019s music.\u201d",
      "Spotify declined to comment to TODAY.com as of Jan. 17.",
      "What exactly does Kendrick Lamar say about Drake in \u2018Not Like Us\u2019?",

      "\u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2018em young/ You better not ever go to cell block one,\u201d and later adds, \u201cCertified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles,\u201d a reference to Drake\u2019s 2021 album, \u201cCertified Lover Boy,\u201d he raps in the song.",
      "The song also mentions a \u201cpredator\u201d whose name \u201cgotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch.\u201d",
      "How did the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar start?",
      "Drake and Lamar weren\u2019t always rivals. Early on in his career, Lamar appeared as a guest artist on Drake\u2019s song \u201cBuried Alive Interlude\u201d from his second studio album, \u201cTake Care,\u201d released in November 2011, and he also appeared as a guest on his \u201cClub Paradise Tour\u201d the following year.",
      "However, things changed after Lamar took shots at Drake and other rappers during his guest verses on Big Sean\u2019s song \u201cControl\u201d in August 2013. He appeared to ridicule Drake again in his lyrics during a performance at the BET Hip-Hop Awards in October 2013.",
      "Between 2014 and 2020 the two artists released several diss tracks about each other but the vitriol between the rappers seemed to die down shortly after that.",
      "Then, in October 2023, Drake collaborated with fellow rapper J.Cole on a track called \u201cFirst Person Shooter.\u201d J.Cole bragged on the track that he, Drake and Lamar were \u201cBig 3\u201d artists in rap, while Drake\u2019s verses compared his stardom to that of Michael Jackson\u2019s.",
      "Lamar responded to \u201cFirst Person Shooter\u201d in March 2024 in blistering guest verses on Metro Boomin and Future\u2019s collaborative track \u201cLike That,\u201d which rose to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.",
      "Lamar blasted the idea of a \u201cBig 3,\u201d insisting there was only a \u201cBig Me.\u201d He also ridiculed Drake for comparing himself to Michael Jackson while likening himself to Prince.",
      "Lamar\u2019s guest verses prompted Drake to quickly release a new diss track about Lamar called \u201cPush Ups,\u201d in which he called Lamar a \u201cpipsqueak.\u201d Less than two weeks later, Lamar took another swipe at Drake in a song called \u201cEuphoria.\u201d",
      "The diss tracks continued at a breakneck pace until it eventually died down in the summer of 2024.",
      "How successful has \u2018Not Like Us\u2019 been?",
      "Both Drake and Lamar have benefited from their renewed beef over the past year. Both artists scored multiple hit songs and received several competing nominations at the 2024 BET Awards.",
      "\u201cNot Like Us,\u201d has been streamed more than a billion times on Spotify, and is nominated for five Grammys 2025 Grammys, including record and song of the year.",

      "Andarna: She is an unknown breed of dragon and the second bonded dragon to Violet. When she was a baby dragon (known as a feathertail) she was able to stop time for brief moments. However, the power faded with age. Currently, she can change the color of her scales, but her development from a child into an adolescent was altered. By the end of \"Iron Flame,\" her personality is akin to that of a teenager: moody, keen on not being left out and searching for independence.",

After seeing the truth, Dain frees Violet just as Xaden and Garrick arrive. Xaden and Violet then kill Varrish together.",

      "Violet and Xaden give the cadets and gryphon fliers the choice to fight or not, and most decide to join.",
      "When they arrive, Violet and Xaden rush to the wardstone, passing dead guards, to find Jack and his dragon within the chamber.

Violet kills the venin and runs to Jesinia, who has been continuously transcribing one of the First Six's journals amidst the battle. Jesinia reveals that Andarna is the secret to activating the wardstone. Andarna turns out to be a dragon breed of her own and waited for Violet \u2014\u00a0a period of 650 years \u2014\u00a0before hatching.",
      "Now, Violet has a solution to their ongoing battle. But a dragon can only power one wardstone, meaning Violet and Xaden have to decide to protect either Basgiath or Aretia.",
      "Xaden tells her to go ahead and ward Basgiath. But first, the wardstone has to be imbued with a rider's power, which typically takes weeks to do safely.",
      "Violet decides to sacrifice herself, pouring all of her power into the wardstone knowing she will die from it. Just before Violet burns out, her mother kicks her aside and forces Sloane to siphon all of her power into the stone. Lilith and her dragon die in an act of sacrifice for her children, and the wards at Basgiath are restored.",
      "The wyvern fall with the wards back up, but a bigger threat looms. It's revealed that while Violet was sacrificing herself, Xaden was taking on a venin general \u2014\u00a0and losing. When Xaden felt Violet dying for him, he channeled power from the Earth so he could save her, turning venin in the process.",
      "Now, in the aftermath of the battle, he reveals his new venin status to Violet, and she looks on in horror.",
      "The final pages of \"Iron Flame\" are from Xaden's perspective. Xaden seeks out Jack for help finding a cure to being venin. Jack responds that there is no cure, saying Xaden will \"only hunger for more\" power.",
      "\"All this time, you've been convincing everyone you're the hero, and now you'll be the villain... especially in her story,\" Jack says. \"Welcome to our f---ed-up family. Guess we're brothers now.\"",
      "What will happen in 'Onyx Storm'?",
      "It's unclear where \"Onyx Storm\" will pick up after the events of \"Iron Flame.\"",
      "Yarros teased what the book will hold in an interview with Elle, revealing that \"fans can expect to see Violet with one singular motivation, which is to save Xaden.\"",
      "\"You\u2019re going to follow the implications of what\u2019s been revealed in\u00a0'Iron Flame,' and you\u2019re going to see Andarna very curious about where she comes from,\" she said. \"I think that\u2019s the biggest thing I can tease before a publisher jumps out and tackles me to the floor.\"",
      "After nearly eighteen months at Basgiath War College, Violet Sorrengail knows there\u2019s no more time for lessons. No more time for uncertainty.",
      "Because the battle has truly begun, and with enemies closing in from outside their walls and within their ranks, it\u2019s impossible to know who to trust.",
      "Now Violet must journey beyond the failing Aretian wards to seek allies from unfamiliar lands to stand with Navarre. The trip will test every bit of her wit, luck, and strength, but she will do anything to save what she loves\u2014her dragons, her family, her home, and\u00a0him.",
      "Even if it means keeping a secret so big, it could destroy everything.",
      "They need an army. They need power. They need\u00a0magic. And they need the one thing only Violet can find\u2014the truth.",
      "But a storm is coming...and not everyone can survive its wrath."

    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker had the kind of career stat line that would be sad if it wasn\u2019t so funny. But funny is what would ultimately cement his legacy.",
      "Uecker, who died Jan. 16 at the age of 90, was a career .200 hitter across six seasons in Major League Baseball. He ultimately embraced his own ineptitude, often mocking himself for his lack of ability on the diamond.",
      "Uecker took his schtick and ran with it, all the way to Hollywood. Nicknamed \u201cMr. Baseball,\u201d he was a frequent, gut-busting guest on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u201d for years after he retired. He appeared in several well-known Miller Lite commercials, in which he poked fun at himself when he declared, \u201cI must be in the front row\u201d after an usher at a game informs him that he\u2019s in the wrong seats. He parlayed those efforts into a starring role on the small screen, playing George Owens on the ABC sitcom \u201cMr. Belvedere,\u201d which ran for six seasons from 1985 until 1990.",
      "But all of that may have just been a prologue for what seems like a casting job that was as natural as a tailor-made 4-6-3 double play. In the hit 1989 movie \u201cMajor League,\u201d Uecker played Cleveland play-by-play announcer Harry Doyle, whose wit would often serve as cover for how awful the team was, only for him to get caught up in the fervor when the team begins winning.",
      "(There's profanity in the clip below.)",

      "\u201cUecker\u2019s irreverence enlivened a character \u2014 the play-by-play announcer \u2014 that had long been taken for granted in baseball films,\u201d Noah Gittell wrote in the 2024 book \u201cBaseball: The Movie.\u201d",
      "\u201cTypically, their role was to set the scene for the film\u2019s climactic game with flowery prose or ... act as foil to the players or manager. (Director and writer David S.) Ward and Uecker collaborated on a true innovation of the genre by turning this archetype into a comic Greek chorus punctuating the clownish action on the field with perfectly delivered zingers. It was a breath of fresh air for the baseball film, which had perhaps become overly solemn in the \u201880s with \u2018The Natural,\u2019 \u2018Field of Dreams\u2019 and \u2018Eight Men Out.\u2019\u201d",
      "Uecker, who spent 54 seasons as the radio play-by-play man for the Milwaukee Brewers, reprised the role in \u201cMajor League II.\u201d He wasn\u2019t just a perfect fit as Harry Doyle, though. He also provided a template for those who came after him.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a play-by-play announcer in the game who hasn\u2019t once paid homage to the film by impersonating Uecker\u2019s delivery of that line,\u201d Gittell added about how Uecker said, \u201cJuuuust a bit outside.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t only announcers, either. If you ever played Wiffle ball in your backyard, turned on a baseball game or, heck, even tried archery and missed a target by 10 feet, you\u2019ve probably said, \u201cJuuuust a bit outside.\u201d",
      "Uecker had an uncanny talent for putting a smile on people\u2019s faces, whether in a studio audience or in a movie theater.",
      "\u201cThe most hilarious guy I\u2019ve ever met, off-camera and on,\u201d \u201cMr. Belvedere\u201d co-star Rob Stone once said about Uecker.",
      "Baseball and movies are known for their characters \u2014 movies for the characters in them, baseball for characters who add personality to the game.

Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor.

      "Williams responded, \u201cDo I seem that way?\u201d The rest of the show\u2019s hosts agreed she didn\u2019t.",
      "Finnie, too, spoke to her aunt\u2019s temperament. \u201cThis does not match an incapacitated person,\u201d she said. \u201cMy aunt has always been a unique personality. \u2026 That is who she is.\u201d",
      "Morrissey did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.",
      "In the Lifetime documentary, Williams often appeared to have cognitive difficulty when speaking to her loved ones. Her son, Kevin Hunter Jr., and manager Will Selby both suggested that these issues were associated with her alcohol use.",

      "Primary progressive aphasia, or PPA, impacts speech, reading, writing and the ability to understand what others are saying to you. It\u2019s a subtype of frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, which affects communication, including speech, writing and the ability to understand language.",

      "Lymphedema is a condition where the limbs \u2014\u00a0in Williams\u2019 case, her feet and legs \u2014 swell because the lymphatic system doesn\u2019t drain properly.

We realized that we had to share that part of our story.\u201d",

      "Among his \u201cbiggest concerns\u201d for the film was how his mom was going to be portrayed, \u201cbecause she is the one that I look up to as my hero. The one that got me through those tough times, that helped me to find that little ounce of hope to keep going.\u201d He tells TODAY.com his goal was to show people where her strength came from.",

      "Jerome echoed Anthony Robles\u2019 comments in an interview with Variety, telling the magazine the athlete coached him 14 hours a day.",
      "\u201cRepeating the same moves again and again. He taught me to use my fists and my arms and to stretch and pull with all these different parts of my body,\u201d the actor said. \u201cIt was the most physically challenging thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d",
      "It was also challenging for Anthony Robles, who said had to get back on the mat for some scenes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a high school wrestling coach. I\u2019m showing technique, but to get back into the physicality of it, I was training like I was back in my wrestling days,\u201d Anthony Robles tells TODAY.com.",

      "Anthony Robles' real-life bond with his coaches",
      "Michael Pe\u00f1a co-stars as coach Bobby Williams, Anthony\u2019s high school coach and one of his biggest champions. To this day, he remains in contact with them and tells TODAY.com that they \u201ctext regularly.\u201d",
      "\u201cBobby Williams, he\u2019s always been like a father figure to me,\" he says, crediting him for helping him find his abilities. \"Walking into the wrestling room for the first time, he treated me like I was a national champion already.\u201d",
      "He adds that Williams also echoed his mom\u2019s advice to him, saying, \u201cMy mom would always tell me, \u2018Focus on what you\u2019re capable of, focus on what you can do, not what you can\u2019t.\u2019 And in the wrestling room, my coach used to tell me, \u2018We\u2019re going to focus on your strengths and camouflage your weaknesses. We\u2019re going to build a style that works for you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Just like in \u201cUnstoppable,\u201d he would get advice from Williams while wrestling in college. They would later go on to coach together for three years.",
      "Don Cheadle took on the role of coach Shawn Charles, Anthony\u2019s ASU wrestling coach who, at first, appears to question Anthony\u2019s ability. He\u2019s quickly proven wrong when Anthony goes above and beyond during try-outs and training.",
      "As for Charles, Anthony Robles says his coach would always back him up when he was struggling. He credits him for taking him to a \u201cwhole new level.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe forced me outside of my comfort zone on a regular basis,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust challenged me to think at a different level and improve myself.\u201d",
      "He says that having them both at the national tournament his senior year, seeing him win and celebrating together \u201cwas something very special, because I could not have gotten there without either one of them.\u201d",
      "Where is Anthony Robles now?",
      "Anthony Robles would go on to become the first athlete signed by Nike after retiring from a sport. At the end of the film, there is a message from former CEO of Nike, Inc. Phil Knight that reads, \u201cAfter what he accomplished, Anthony Robles will be a Nike athlete for life.\u201d",
      "In 2013, former President Barack Obama appointed him to President\u2019s council on fitness, sports and nutrition, and in 2022 he took over as wrestling coach at Mesa High in Arizona.",
      "Now a motivational speaker and author, Anthony Robles is a husband and father. He and wife, Laura Robles, have been married for three years. They are parents to a 2-year-old boy named Abel.",
      "He also continues to be a wrestling coach, helping other students get motivated and inspired.",
      "\u201cIf I can help even one of them, that\u2019s my way of giving back and saying thank you to the people who helped me to get here today,\u201d he says."

      "James, whose season of the ABC dating competition aired in 2021, announced his split from Kirkconnell in an Instagram post on Jan. 16.",
      "\"Father God, give Rachael and I strength to mend our broken hearts. Give us a peace about this decision to end our relationship that transcends worldly understanding,\" he captioned the post. \"Shower our friends and family with kindness and love to comfort us. And remind us that our Joy comes from you, Lord \ud83d\udc94.\"",

      "Despite Kirkconnell's public apology, James did not move forward with their relationship at the time.",
      "He explained his decision while speaking with Kirkconnell during the special, saying, \"When I questioned our relationship, it was in the context of you not fully understanding my Blackness and what it means to be a Black man in America, and what it would mean for our kids when I saw those things that were floating around the Internet.\u201d",
      "James added that he ended their relationship so Kirkconnell could work on herself. Meanwhile, she said she felt blindsided.",
      "\u201cI thought about how strong I thought our relationship was, so for him to end things, he must have been very, very hurt by everything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was hard because I lost the love of my life and in the process of doing that, I hurt him. \u2026 I love him so much and I always will.\u201d",
      "The couple later reunited and went on to date for several years.",
      "In February 2024, James talked to People about getting engaged to Kirkconnell in the future.",

    "story": [
      "As a girl, Aaliyah dreamed of musical stardom \u2014 and used her Barbie dolls to act them out.",
      "\u201cThe dolls would be singing and they\u2019d be performing. Sometimes I\u2019d try to get in on it,\u201d Rashad Haughton, the late singer\u2019s brother and a writer and director, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Aaliyah's childhood fantasies turned into reality as she grew up and became one of the most celebrated R&B artists of the \u201890. Sadly, the singer, whose full name was Aaliyah Haughton, passed away at the age of 22 in 2001 following a plane crash.",
      "Nearly 24 years after Aaliyah\u2019s death, the singer is being honored with a Barbie doll in her likeness.",
      "Part of the Barbie Music Collector Series, the doll is being released on the singer\u2019s birthday, Jan. 16. and will be available to purchase on the Mattel Shop for a suggested retail price of $55. (As of Jan. 16 at 9:34 a.m., the doll is sold out).",
      "Haughton worked closely with Mattel to design a doll that would resemble his sister and capture her style. The end result? A striking doll that rocks a miniature replica of the outfit Aaliyah wore in the music video for her hit song \u201cOne in a Million.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was the second album and \u2018One in a Million\u2019 was such a key song in transitioning her sound to maturity, empowerment, confidence at that point in her career,\u201d Haughton says.",
      "Haughton and Mattel worked together to design the doll\u2019s outfit, which consists of a faux leather black top and matching pants with lace-up details, a zippered vest with detached sleeves and cool sunglasses. The Mattel team also enlisted the insight of Aaliyah\u2019s stylist Derek Lee.",
      "Haughton was \u201cblown away\u201d when he saw the final product and thinks his sister would approve of the edgy ensemble since her favorite color was \u201call black.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still tight fitting, it\u2019s still a little bit sexy. But it\u2019s pants so it brings that power and that confidence and expression. It really just checked all the boxes of what my sister represents and also what Barbie represents, which is empowerment and expression,\u201d he explains.",
      "Best known for the musical style she called \u201cstreet but sweet\u201d and hits like \u201cTry Again,\u201d Aaliyah earned a host of awards throughout her career, including three American Music Awards for favorite soul/R&B female artist and two MTV Video Music Awards. She also collaborated with top musicians, including Missy Elliot and Timbaland.",
      "Haughton regularly worked as a creative consultant for the singer. Following an Aaliyah makeup collection with M.A.C. in 2018, the singer\u2019s Barbie doll is the latest brand collaboration Haughton has spearheaded to ensure that his sister\u2019s legacy lives on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like that job that I had with her is still continuing. And obviously it\u2019s emotional at times, but it\u2019s also wonderful because there\u2019s a lot of meaning in that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt brings back memories and it continues on dreams that we had when she was here. In a lot of ways, it makes me feel like things are continuing on as they should, and those dreams are still valuable and they\u2019re still real.\u201d",
      "Haughton calls the collaboration with Mattel \u201ca dream come true\u201d for himself and Aaliyah.",
      "\u201cIt was something that I always wanted because I know it was something that was my sister\u2019s dream,\u201d he says.",
      "With her new doll, Aaliyah joins other legendary musicians who have been part of the Barbie Music Collector Series, including Gloria Estevan, David Bowie, Elvis Presley, Elton John and Stevie Nicks.",
      "\u201cTo have my sister part of that list, it really is a testament to her legacy, and I\u2019m elated to have this doll come out. It\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Haughton says.",
      "When asked how he wants people to remember Aaliyah, Haughton shares a quote his sister once gave during an appearance on MTV.",
      "\u201cWhat she said was, \u2018I want people to remember me as a true entertainer\u2019 because she really, truly loved what she did every single day. As hard as the work was and as challenging it was, I think it\u2019s not work when you love what you do,\u201d he says.",
      "Noting that Aaliyah was always \u201cappreciative\u201d of her success, Haughton recalls how those dreams started in her childhood bedroom while playing with her Barbie dolls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s (about) imagination and taking that imagination and dreaming about what you want to be, then taking those steps from childhood to the future and making it real. My sister did that. Every little girl can do that too. That\u2019s the message that I want people to take from this collaboration.\""

    "summary": "TEL AVIV \u2014 For eight months, the framework of the ceasefire deal that could bring an end to the war between Israel and Hamas had been on the table, prompting fury about the delay among some, and now praise for President-elect Donald Trump for helping to get it over the line.",

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 For eight months, the framework of the ceasefire deal that could bring an end to the war between Israel and Hamas had been on the table, prompting fury about the delay among some, and now praise for President-elect Donald Trump for helping to get it over the line.",
      "President Joe Biden confirmed in a statement Wednesday that the deal was based on the \u201cprecise contours\u201d of a May 2024 ceasefire plan that was \u201cendorsed unanimously\u201d by the United Nations Security Council. He also credited the work of key negotiators, including Egypt and Qatar, and \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on Hamas for helping to secure the truce.",
      "While U.S. officials have credited the collaboration between Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and Biden\u2019s Middle East representative Brett McGurk for securing the deal, the president-elect sought to claim much of the credit for himself on Thursday.",
      "Biden \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said in an interview on \u201cThe Dan Bongino Show.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIf I didn\u2019t do this, if we didn\u2019t get involved, the hostages would never be out.\u201d",
      "The deal could soon bring an end to more than 15 months of war in Gaza that began on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hamas attacks on Israel in which roughly 1,200 people were killed and around 240 people taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict. Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 46,500 people since then, according to health officials in the enclave.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Trump directly for his role in the negotiations in a phone call Wednesday, Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement. Afterward, he thanked Biden in a separate call, the statement added.",
      "For David Mencer, a spokesman for Netanyahu, it was Hamas that had changed its stance since the deal was first tabled in May. The death of its leader Yahya Sinwar, who was confirmed killed by Israeli forces in October, had also played a role, he said in a voice note Friday.",
      "\u201cWhat changed was that Hamas had been heavily degraded,\u201d he said, adding that most of its leadership had been \u201celiminated\u201d and \u201ctheir weapons stockpile has been wiped out.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d on Thursday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also said, \u201cWhat really got us to this point was the isolating and weakening of Hamas.\u201d Previously, Hamas had thrown up obstacles to the deal \u201ctime and time again\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t willing to negotiate in good faith,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s support for the deal had \u201ccertainly helped,\u201d but \u201cwe need to stop worrying about this whole credit business and who gets credit for what,\u201d he said.",
      "Asher Kaufman, a professor of history and peace studies at Indiana\u2019s University of Notre Dame, also noted that progress in the talks came amid a shifting landscape in the Middle East, although he did attribute the success to Trump.",
      "\u201cIt has to be remembered that the world, the region has changed with the weakening of Hezbollah, the weakening of Iran, the fall of Assad,\u201d he said in a phone interview on Thursday. \u201cThere are changing dynamics ... which facilitate the possibility of such an arrangement.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said, he believed that ultimately Trump was \u201cthe game changer in a sense, because of the relationship between him and Netanyahu.\u201d",
      "Inside Israel, many are crediting the \u201cTrump effect\u201d for the breakthrough.",
      "Among them is Efrat Machikawa, whose 80-year-old uncle Gadi Moses remains in captivity. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for the Biden administration for the very long period where they tried, but I have to say the Trump effect is great,\u201d Machikawa, 56, said Friday.",
      "Machikawa, 56, added that she had not received any news about her uncle for months, but he is\u00a0on the list of the 33 hostages expected to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire deal. Not knowing his fate was \u201cjust terrible,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump was also credited as the \u201cX factor\u201d that got the deal over the line by Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was taken hostage and killed in Gaza. Dickmann said in an interview Wednesday that the only thing that had changed since May was \u201cthat Carmel is now dead and Trump is now president, and now we have a deal.\u201d",
      "In Gaza, the death toll has risen by more than 11,500 since May, according to Palestinian tallies, although researchers have warned that the death toll is likely significantly higher than official numbers suggest and thousands of people are feared buried under the rubble.",
      "Even Gershon Baskin, an Israeli who has acted as a mediator with Hamas for decades, credited Trump for the success, although he said it was \u201cdisgusting\u201d that a truce has only come to fruition eight months after it was first tabled.",
      "Pointing to the fact that thousands of Palestinians and several hostages were killed in Gaza in the intervening period, Baskin, a frequent critic of Netanyahu\u2019s government, said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that it had taken so long.",
      "\u201cIt was only really accepted in the end because Trump came along and Trump told Netanyahu to do it,\u201d added the seasoned negotiator, who helped to secure the release of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit more than a decade ago.",
      "Just as it seemed ready to be approved, the deal appeared to hit a roadblock after Netanyahu\u2019s office claimed Hamas had reneged on part of the agreement \u2014 an accusation the group strongly denied.",
      "However, in the early hours of Friday morning, Nentanyahu\u2019s office said he would seek approval for a deal from his security Cabinet and then his full Cabinet. Israel\u2019s Supreme Court would then have 24 hours to permit an appeal.",
      "If all goes to plan, the deal will come into effect as early as this Sunday, the day before Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "But Baskin said he feared a \u201cdifficult process\u201d in seeing the three-phase ceasefire deal enforced in the months ahead.",
      "\u201cThe crucial thing is that it has to be implemented now,\u201d he said."

His father, who says he's been through a \u201cliving hell\u201d for 15 months now, says he won\u2019t believe the news of his son's pending release until he's actually returned home.",
      "His father, Jonathan Dekel-Chen, told NBC News that as of early afternoon Thursday, he had yet to hear from anyone outside of the media that his son was scheduled to be freed \u00a0in the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal.",

In the first year of Trump\u2019s first term,\u00a0U.S. forces, working with Syrian Kurdish allies,\u00a0defeated\u00a0the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d and liberated\u00a0its capital. But the fall of the Assad regime has left Syria at risk of coming apart under pressure from a variety of terrorist groups, local militias and Israeli airstrikes. And Syria\u2019s interim leaders, while proclaiming moderate intentions, have roots\u00a0in Al Qaeda and\u00a0another terrorist group, Hayat al Sham (HTS). The\u00a0nightmare scenario for many experts is that\u00a0ISIS could re-establish its stronghold in the fledgling state and export more terrorism to the West or inspire it, as it did the New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans.",

He\u00a0also\u00a0said the Kurdish forces are coming under increased pressure from\u00a0Turkish\u00a0President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who views them, along with\u00a0Kurdish separatists based in Syria\u00a0known as the PKK,\u00a0as threats\u00a0to his regime.",

Bush,\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0recently\u00a0that even if Trump were to continue bombing campaigns and targeted operations against the terrorist group, removing U.S. troops would leave the Kurdish coalition vulnerable and ultimately lead to an expanded footprint for ISIS.",
      "\u201cWith those troops out of there, we\u2019re putting a lot of U.S. interests at risk,\u201d\u00a0Kattouf\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t see\u00a0[HTS]\u00a0or other allied rebel forces able to take on that issue right now.\u201d",
      "The fear among Biden administration counterterrorism officials\u00a0is that\u00a0a Trump withdrawal of U.S. forces would leave the Syrian Kurds guarding the ISIS prisoners vulnerable to attacks from other factions \u2014 or the looming presence of Turkey, just across the border.\u00a0Both\u00a0Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden\u00a0have worked hard to restrain Erdo\u011fan,\u00a0whose country remains\u00a0a NATO ally, from attacking America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Trump said\u00a0at his news conference last week that\u00a0he had asked Erdo\u011fan\u00a0not to\u00a0go\u00a0after \u201ccertain people,\u201d clearly referring to the Kurds.

      "Beyond serving as a base for operations and planning, any Syrian territory that falls to ISIS could help it project an image of power and resistance and inspire others around the world. The group has already been\u00a0expanding its global\u00a0reach through social media, sponsoring attacks and\u00a0influencing followers worldwide, including so-called lone wolves,\u00a0through what anti-terrorism experts say is a surge of sophisticated online propaganda. CIA Director William Burns\u00a0told NPR\u00a0last\u00a0week\u00a0that\u00a0the agency is \u201cquite concerned\u201d about the rising threat posed by ISIS, particularly its \u201cability to inspire people.\u201d\u00a0And in July, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned the House Judiciary Committee that \u201cthe greatest terrorism threat to our homeland has been posed by lone actors or small cells of individuals who typically radicalize to violence online and use easily accessible weapons to attack soft targets.\u201d",
      "The U.S. intelligence community\u00a0and the FBI have been sounding those alarm bells for more than a year.\u00a0A senior administration official\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0on Friday, \u201cThere is a heightened focus on ISIS,\u201d pointing to the cancellation of three Taylor Swift Eras Tour shows in Vienna in August after warnings from U.S. intelligence of ISIS terrorist plots targeting the venues. And in March, gunmen from ISIS-K, an affiliate of ISIS based in Afghanistan, killed more than 130 people at the Crocus City Hall, a well-known concert venue outside Moscow, despite warnings from U.S. intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",

      "Clearly alarmed by the possibility of the collapsed state\u2019s exporting terrorism to Europe,\u00a0two weeks ago\u00a0the foreign ministers of France and Germany, representing the European Union, traveled to Damascus to meet Syria\u2019s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa,\u00a0who was\u00a0known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, before he disavowed his connections with\u00a0HTS.",
      "American boots?",
      "\u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend,\u201d Trump said on X in the hours before the collapse of the Assad regime, adding, \u201cThe United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!\u201d",

Mike Waltz,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance for the United States to intervene in Syria but underscored the incoming administration\u2019s commitment to combating ISIS. \u201cWe do not need American boots running around Syria in any way, shape or form, but we\u2019re keeping an eye on those things, ISIS, Israel\u2019s border, and kind of the broader dynamic with our Gulf allies,\u201d Waltz said on a podcast late last month.",
      "But experts question the ability to continue the fight against ISIS in Syria without a U.S.\u00a0military\u00a0presence.",
      "During the transition, a senior Biden administration official said, the current administration has been briefing Trump\u2019s national security team on the need for a continued U.S. military presence to prevent Russia, Turkey or Iran from gaining dominance. The outgoing Biden administration has itself been treading carefully, sending its top Middle East diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Barbara\u00a0Leaf, to Damascus only after European counterparts had already visited and only after\u00a0public pressure\u00a0from the mother of Austin Tice, the American journalist believed to be imprisoned in Syria,\u00a0who said\u00a0the United States should be more engaged.\u00a0To even meet with the new interim leader, the State Department first\u00a0had to lift\u00a0the\u00a0$10\u00a0million bounty\u00a0it\u00a0had\u00a0put\u00a0on\u00a0his\u00a0head\u00a0when he led\u00a0HTS.",
      "But now the critical question of whether the United States should play a role in preventing Syria from again harboring terrorists or permitting power plays from U.S. regional adversaries will be on Trump\u2019s doorstep as he arrives at the White House. That and the challenge of combating the online propaganda that spreads ISIS\u2019 terrorist philosophy far and wide."

    "summary": "The arrival of American users on RedNote has brought instant online connection between Americans and Chinese even as academic and other exchanges have dampened.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 For most people in the U.S. and China, what they hear about each other\u2019s countries comes mostly from their governments and the media. Now they are learning directly from each other, at least for now.",
      "The excitement is palpable on the Chinese social media platform RedNote, or Xiaohongshu (\u201cLittle Red Book\u201d) as it\u2019s known in Chinese, after a wave of American users set up accounts in recent days. The self-described \u201cTikTok refugees\u201d are seeking a replacement for the short-form video app as it faces a U.S. ban stemming from concerns over ties between TikTok\u2019s owner, Beijing-based ByteDance, and the Chinese government.",
      "TikTok says it will go dark when the ban takes effect Sunday unless it receives \u201cdefinitive\u201d assurances from the Biden administration, which has been \u201cexploring options\u201d for how to keep the app available, NBC News reported.",
      "In protest of the looming ban, TikTok users have joined Shanghai-based RedNote, sending it to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store and mocking U.S. security concerns as they try to navigate the Chinese-language app.",
      "Their arrival has brought instant online connection between Americans and Chinese even as academic and other exchanges have been dampened in recent years by pandemic border restrictions and tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",
      "\u201cI feel very touched to see all of the friendly American people coming here, and see we are getting to know each other and learning from each other,\u201d said Eric Wang, a 28-year-old graphic designer from China\u2019s Shandong province. \u201cIt makes me feel that we\u2019re never really far away from each other.\u201d",
      "On RedNote, Americans and Chinese can communicate in a way they are mostly unable to on Western social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and X, all of which are inaccessible in China without VPNs. TikTok is also not available in China, although it does have a version there called Douyin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very moving to see people who have never met, and who may have been misinformed about each other in the past, now engaging on equal terms and eager to learn about each other,\u201d said Jia Yuxuan, a research associate at the Center for China and Globalization, a think tank in Beijing.",
      "The trust that is being established through these connections \u201chas already led to a wave of fact-checking that traditional diplomacy hasn\u2019t been able to achieve in years,\u201d she said.",
      "For example, Americans on RedNote have been asking if people in China really live under a \u201csocial credit system\u201d that scores individuals based on their behavior and blacklists them if their scores are too low.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese netizens in the comments section are simply astonished and say, \u2018This is not true,\u2019\u201d Jia said.",
      "In just one day this week, the number of U.S. iPhone users on RedNote increased from about 400,000 to 1.8 million, according to data from analytics firm Similarweb, and it has since gone even higher. That is still a tiny portion of the 170 million American users on TikTok and 300 million users on Xiaohongshu overall.",
      "The new American users could create problems for the app, which like other Chinese social media platforms is strictly controlled by government censors and is not well equipped to moderate English-language content. The situation has drawn comparisons to the Clubhouse app, which China blocked in 2021 after a brief period in which Chinese users freely discussed politically taboo topics in its chat rooms.",
      "Xiaohongshu has not publicly commented on the influx of new users. The company did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Americans, meanwhile, may chafe under China\u2019s online censorship.",
      "\u201cThere is a very naive base of users in America, who don\u2019t understand any of this. They\u2019re just upset that TikTok is going to be banned,\u201d said Christine Lu, 48, a Los Angeles-based Taiwanese American who lived in China for a decade.",
      "It took all of five hours for Lu\u2019s RedNote account to be banned after she signed up on Tuesday, after she purposely posted hashtags and pictures related to topics deemed sensitive in China. She said she began testing the app after seeing some American users complain that some of their posts, including ones showing cleavage or the flags of Taiwan and Tibet, were getting blocked.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re posts that otherwise in free societies are very normal conversation topics,\u201d she said.",
      "Not all Chinese users are thrilled with the Americans piling into their online community.\u00a0Some who depend on RedNote as a source of income say they may face unfair competition from their American counterparts, whose TikTok-length videos are far shorter than what is typical for the Chinese app.",
      "\u201cIt only takes like two seconds and they\u2019re getting hundreds, thousands and even tens of thousands of likes,\u201d said Becca Wang, a lifestyle vlogger in Beijing.",
      "Others say the new American users need to learn to play by the rules of the Chinese-language app and should respect the culture of its existing users, including by using the app\u2019s Chinese name of Xiaohongshu.",
      "\u201cIf they can\u2019t pronounce it, they should learn,\u201d one comment read.",
      "Yolanda Ma, a journalism lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, said it was unclear how the app would handle the influx of American users. For example, live broadcasts are required to be in Chinese, with English and other languages considered inappropriate and subject to warnings.",
      "If the company decides to broaden its user base, she said in an email, then the best approach would be a separate app for international users, \u201cto both ensure the content on the platform is under control, and to keep the new users on the platform after the initial few days of excitement.\u201d",
      "The discussion between American and Chinese users on RedNote revolves around what they had for breakfast, how they make their morning coffee, what their front yards look like and how they make a living. Jia saw one American fisherman ask if there are fishermen in China.",
      "\u201cIn the comment section, everybody is sharing their catch and fishing equipment,\u201d she said.",
      "Users are also going deeper, asking one another about salaries, debt and health care systems to compare how well they\u2019re living under America\u2019s capitalist system and China\u2019s socialist system.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion is that the ordinary workers are basically the same,\u201d Jia said. \u201cThey\u2019re both struggling for life, and they\u2019re also aspiring for a better life.\u201d",
      "Diego Obando, a new RedNote user who lives in Pasadena, California, says the app is fairly easy to use and has a \u201cnicer\u201d community than TikTok. Obando, 19, said he isn\u2019t really concerned about security, because \u201cthere\u2019s always someone spying on you on any app you\u2019re on.\u201d",
      "Beijing has so far appeared open to the idea of Americans on RedNote.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that \u201cwe believe that the use of social media is a personal choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a matter of principle, China has always supported and encouraged strengthening people-to-people exchanges and the promotion of people-to-people bonds with all countries,\u201d spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a regular briefing in Beijing.",
      "Chinese state media coverage has also been positive.",
      "\u201cMoving to RedNote can be seen as an act of defiance against the U.S. government\u2019s narrative that Chinese apps are security threats,\u201d read a commentary Wednesday in the People\u2019s Daily newspaper. \u201cBy embracing RedNote, users challenge the assumption that Chinese platforms are inherently dangerous.\u201d",
      "Jia said Beijing\u2019s openness to the new RedNote users was in line with its efforts to draw more foreign tourists as its economy struggles to recover from the pandemic. Since 2023, China has introduced visa-free policies for visitors from countries around the world, though not yet the United States.",
      "Others were more skeptical, saying the Chinese government was bound to step in.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to last forever,\u201d said Wang, the lifestyle blogger. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be short.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki, the hottest international free agent in baseball, is headed to the Los Angeles Dodgers, he announced on social media Friday.",
      "The 23-year-old right-hander said he signed a minor-league deal. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.",
      "\"I have signed a minor contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers,\" he said on Instagram in a translated post from Japanese to English. \"It was a very difficult decision, but I will do my best to make it the right decision when I look back after my baseball career. I want to slip my sleeve on the Dodgers uniform at the opening conference, thanking everyone who has supported me this far.\"",
      "Sasaki is just the latest Japanese star to join MLB. Reigning National League MVP Shohei Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers ahead of the 2024 season after six years with the Los Angeles Angels. The franchise also brought in pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto in 2023 on a 12-year, $325 million deal. Both were instrumental in Los Angeles winning the 2024 World Series.",
      "Sasaki's long-awaited signing follows a suspenseful offseason, during which teams including the, San Diego Padres, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Yankees, the Chicago Cubs and the San Francisco Giants courted the young pitcher. For his initial meetings with teams, Sasaki requested that no players be present, prompting much speculation around his landing spot.",
      "By Monday, Sasaki had narrowed down his finalists to Blue Jays, Dodgers and Padres. Many saw the Dodgers as the long-held favorites thanks to his experience playing with Ohtani and Yamamoto on the Japanese national team and the team\u2019s star-studded lineup. The Padres were also seen as a major contender because Sasaki would be reunited with his one-time mentor, accomplished Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish.",
      "Despite Sasaki\u2019s draw, his contract isn\u2019t the blockbuster that others like Ohtani have signed because of MLB rules. International players under the age of 25 are considered amateurs and can only sign a minor-league contract with an additional bonus.",
      "Sasaki, who played for the Chiba Lotte Marines in Japan\u2019s Nippon Professional Baseball League, has a career ERA of 2.10 with 505 career strikeouts and a 29-15 record. In 2022, he threw a perfect game against the Orix Buffaloes, NPB\u2019s first perfect game in almost 30 years.

He\u2019s incredibly talented. We all know that. But he is a guy that wants to be great. He\u2019s not coming here just to be rich or to get a huge contract. He wants to be great.

      "The signing of the treaty with Iran follows last year\u2019s pact with North Korea \u2014 countries once identified by former President George W. Bush, along with Iraq, as \u201cthe Axis of Evil.\u201d",
      "Welcoming Pezeshkian as they sat down for talks, Putin said the new treaty will \u201cgive an additional impulse to practically all areas of our cooperation.\u201d",
      "Pezeshkian, who met Putin for the third time since coming to power in July, said the documents form a \u201csolid foundation for our forward movement.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe do consider our relations with you as vital, sensitive and strategic, and we are on this path strongly,\u201d he said.",
      "The Iranian president emphasized that countries in the region should resolve their own problems themselves, adding in an apparent reference to the U.S. that the presence of outside forces will only exacerbate tensions and destabilize the situation.",
      "\u201cThey come from another side of the world to make chaos in the region,\u201d he said. \u201cThese ties will defuse their plot, definitely.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s ties with Iran have grown closer after Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine and the West have accused Tehran of providing Moscow with hundreds of drones for use to attack Ukraine, which Moscow and Tehran have denied.",
      "Pezeshkian spoke in support of prospective Russia-Ukraine peace talks, saying that \u201cwar is not a solution\u201d and urging the West to \u201cavoid imposing excessive demands\u201d and acknowledge others\u2019 \u201csecurity concerns.\u201d",
      "Last year, Iran joined the BRICS bloc of developing economies and Pezeshkian attended its summit, which was hosted by Russia in Kazan.",
      "Russia and Iran, which had troubled relations in the past, developed cordial ties after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, with Moscow emerging as a key trade partner and supplier of weapons and technologies for Tehran, which has faced bruising international sanctions.",
      "Russia built Iran\u2019s first nuclear plant that was launched in 2013 and is building two more nuclear reactors there.",
      "Russia was part of the 2015 deal between Iran and six nuclear powers offering sanctions relief for Tehran in exchange for curbing its atomic program, and the Kremlin offered political support to Iran when the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the agreement during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Russia and Iran also pooled their efforts to shore up Bashar Assad\u2019s government during Syria\u2019s civil war, but failed to prevent his downfall last month after a lightning offensive by the opposition. Assad and his family fled to Russia.",
      "His ouster dealt another blow to Tehran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d across the region, which had already been pummeled by Israel\u2019s offensives against two militant groups backed by Iran \u2014Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel also attacked Iran directly on two occasions.",
      "Tehran increasingly needs Moscow\u2019s assistance as it faces economic woes and stinging setbacks across its sphere of influence in the Middle East. The troubles could deepen after Trump returns to the White House with his policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran.",
      "In particular, Iran wants sophisticated Russian weapons like long-range air defense systems and fighter jets to help fend off possible attacks by Israel."

      "FIFA has suspended Panama's soccer federation president in the wake of fat-shaming comments he aimed at a star player on Panama's national team last May.",
      "The decision to ban Manuel Arias, who is the acting president of the Panamanian Football Federation known as FEPAFUT, means he will be barred \u00a0by the international football governing body for six months.",
      "\"President Arias was sanctioned for 6 months until July 14, 2025, a period during which he will not be able to participate in activities related to federated football,\" a statement from FEPAFUT said late Thursday.",
      "As replacement, First Vice President Fernando Arce will be taking over the lead duties, the statement added.",
      "Arias' sanction comes months after he directed body-shaming comments towards the Panama women's national team in response to a comment by star player Marta Cox.",
      "After her team was knocked out of an international tournament last spring, Cox told local media that Panama players' greatest hurdle was their lack of adequate facilities at home.",
      "The comment sparked an outburst from Arias, who told reporters that Cox is \"out of shape, she\u2019s fat, she couldn\u2019t move on the pitch.\"",
      "Arias added that Cox, who made history in 2023 for scoring Panama's first-ever Women's World Cup goal, \"doesn't know anything about the Panama league for years, she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here.\u201d",

      "Quickly after, the federation said Arias \"pledged\" he would not repeat those comments.",
      "\"In the Federation we are committed to continue working for women's football, as we have been doing for the last five years through sports and training programs focused on women,\" the federation said in a statement last May.",
      "Nonetheless, FIFA has decided to bar the president from the league, a decision that FEPAFUT said they had no part in.",
      "\"It is important to emphasize that the Panamanian Football Federation is not a party to any past or present proceedings before any FIFA jurisdictional body and this sanction imposed on the president does not, and will not, affect the normal functioning of the institution,\" the federation's statement Thursday said.",
      "After the ban was announced Thursday, Arias took to social media to acknowledge what he called his \"unfortunate\" language.",
      "\u201cI used some very unfortunate language that should never be used,\u201d Arias said on X.",
      "The federation added that they still hope to continue with their goal of promoting the women's team \"through concrete actions such as equalizing travel expenses and prizes in our women\u2019s and men\u2019s teams, in addition to the recent renewal of the coaching staff in our U-20 and Senior women\u2019s teams, without forgetting the continued development of the Women\u2019s and Men\u2019s Youth Tournaments in their U-14 and U-16 categories.\"",
      "Still, the federation continued, it recognizes \"we still have work to do.\"",

      "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014\u00a0A\u00a0Pakistani\u00a0court\u00a0sentenced\u00a0former Prime Minister Imran Khan\u00a0to 14 years in prison on Friday in a land corruption case,\u00a0a setback to nascent\u00a0talks\u00a0between his party and the government aimed at cooling political instability in the South Asian nation.",
      "The verdict in the case was delivered by an anti-graft\u00a0court\u00a0in a prison in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where Khan has been jailed since August 2023.",
      "Khan\u2019s wife, Bushra Bibi, was also found guilty and sentenced to seven years in prison. She was out on bail but was taken into custody after the judgment was pronounced, Geo News reported.",
      "Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told reporters that Khan\u2019s party could reach out to higher\u00a0courts to appeal against the ruling, and that the former cricket star could also file a mercy petition to the president of\u00a0Pakistan.",
      "Omar Ayub, an aide to Khan, said the party would challenge the verdict in higher\u00a0courts.",
      "The former premier, 72, had been\u00a0indicted on\u00a0charges that he and his wife were gifted land by a real estate developer during his premiership from 2018 to 2022 in exchange for illegal favors.",
      "Khan and Bibi had pleaded not guilty.",
      "The case is linked to Al-Qadir Trust, a nongovernment welfare body the couple set up when Khan was in office.",
      "Prosecutors say the trust was a front for Khan to illegally receive land from a real estate developer. They said he was given 60 acres near Islamabad and another large plot close to his hilltop mansion in the capital.",
      "Khan\u2019s\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party says the land was not for personal gain and was for the spiritual and educational institution the former prime minister had set up.",
      "\u201cWhilst we wait for detailed decision, it\u2019s important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,\u201d PTI\u2019s foreign media wing said in a statement.",
      "The announcement of the verdict was delayed three times, most recently on Monday, amid reconciliation talks between PTI and the government. The two sides have been at loggerheads since Khan was ousted from office in 2022.",
      "The verdict is the biggest setback for Khan and his party since a surprisingly good showing in the 2024 general election, when\u00a0PTI\u2019s\u00a0candidates \u2014\u00a0who were forced to contest as independents \u2014\u00a0won the most seats, but fell short of the majority needed to form a government.",
      "Jailed since August 2023, Khan has been facing\u00a0dozens of cases ranging from charges of graft and misuse of power, to inciting violence against the state after being removed from office in a parliamentary vote of confidence in April 2022.",
      "He has either been acquitted or his\u00a0sentences\u00a0suspended in most cases, except for\u00a0this one and another\u00a0on charges of inciting supporters to rampage through military facilities to protest his arrest on\u00a0May 9, 2023.",
      "His supporters have led several\u00a0violent\u00a0protest rallies since the May 9 incidents.",
      "Khan\u2019s cases have\u00a0been tried inside\u00a0prison on\u00a0security grounds."
