      "The United States-based Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) said the shutdown was made in collaboration with Egyptian authorities.",
      "With its 80 associated domains, Streameast was the largest illicit live sports streaming operation in the world, ACE said.",
      "\u201cToday, ACE scored a resounding victory in its fight to detect, deter, and dismantle criminal perpetrators of digital piracy: by taking down the largest illegal live sports platform anywhere,\u201d ACE chairman Charles Rivkin said in the announcement.",

      "\u201cDismantling Streameast is a major victory for everyone who invests in and relies on the live sports ecosystem,\u201d said Ed McCarthy, chief operating officer of the DAZN streaming group. \u201cThis criminal operation was siphoning value from sports at every level and putting fans across the world at risk.

      "On Christmas Eve, while Cliff is heading to Brittany\u2019s family home for a holiday celebration, he trips and chips his tooth. With most dentist offices closed, he ends up at the door of Didi (Liz Larsen). Their interactions are, at first, awkward. Cliff is informal and prying; Didi, many years his senior, is more official. As a partner for Cliff\u2019s eager conversation, Didi, a woman with a defeated, just-getting-through-the-day, middle-aged melancholy, would seem about the least genial match.",

And when the dental work is done, Cliff realizes his car has been towed. Didi reluctantly offers a ride, and, from there, the two end up on an unlikely Christmas Eve odyssey together, without the supernatural qualities of Dickens but nevertheless with ghosts from the past along the way, such as Didi\u2019s ex-husband and Cliff\u2019s former improv troupe (named The Baltimorons).",

      "Zach Cregger's horror proved its staying power as a late-summer viral success and regained the top spot after last weekend saw \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d give Netflix its first box-office win. \u201cWeapons\u201d generated $10.2 million during its fourth weekend in theaters.",

Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 film took \u201ca bite out of the box office,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore, earning $8.1 million in 3,200 North American theaters.",
      "\u201cHow appropriate that a movie that\u2019s celebrating its 50 years, an all-time classic, Jaws, should be as relevant today as it was when it opened,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIt\u2019s so great because we need every dollar to contribute to the bottom line for this summer.\u201d",
      "The rerelease helped boost a summer with earnings likely coming in at $3.7 billion, just under last summer. Still, this year will miss the typical pre-pandemic summer box office benchmark of $4 billion, Dergarabedian said.",
      "\u201cThere were casualties this summer. It\u2019s a very crowded summer, very competitive,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t get to that four billion mark unless every movie just clicked and is performing at or above expectations.\u201d",
      "This summer's earnings were front-loaded, with May releases like \u201cThunderbolts\u201d and \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d becoming box office wins. However, the latter half of the summer struggled despite the success of movies like \u201cWeapons.\"",
      "Dergarabedian said the summer succeeded in provided high-quality movies and marketing, but it's \u201ckind of limping a bit to the finish line in terms of the summer movie season.\u201d",

      "Lee Corso is set to retire from ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d on Saturday",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- It is rare for a sports broadcasting figure to retire on his own terms or to be able to accept the tributes or adulation of colleagues and fans.",
      "Lee Corso gets to experience that on Saturday.",
      "Corso makes his final appearance as part of ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d crew before No. 3 and reigning national champion Ohio State hosts top-ranked Texas.",
      "Since announcing his retirement earlier this year, Corso has received his share of acclaim and send-offs. He was honored at the ESPY Awards in July and received a standing ovation before boarding his flight in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gamut of different emotions. I\u2019m trying to stay in the celebratory lane this weekend,\u201d said GameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit, who has sat next to Corso since 1996. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be emotional or sad when it\u2019s his last show. We can be sad next week. But this weekend, we need to be celebrating him. Everything he\u2019s meant to us and to the sport.\u201d",
      "Corso, who turned 90 on Aug. 7, has been a part of \u201cGameDay\u201d since its start in 1987 and has made pregame shows entertaining under a simple philosophy: \u201cFootball is just the vehicle. It\u2019s entertainment, sweetheart.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlmost everyone, no matter what they accomplish in our industry, sort of gets dragged out boots first. They don\u2019t really get a chance to say farewell,\u201d GameDay host Rece Davis said on Friday after a production meeting. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real blessing that we\u2019re able to give Lee his flowers on a day when he\u2019s feeling great, doing great, and excited for a game.\u201d",
      "GameDay\u2019s 26th appearance in Columbus also marks a full-circle moment for Corso. It was outside Ohio Stadium on Oct. 5, 1996, where Corso\u2019s popular headgear prediction segment began.",
      "Corso donned Brutus Buckeye\u2019s head before Ohio State faced Penn State, and the rest is history.",
      "Corso has worn 69 different schools\u2019 mascot headgear and has dressed up as Notre Dame\u2019s Fighting Irish leprechaun, the Stanford tree, and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. However, Brutus remains Corso\u2019s first love, wearing it 45 times.",
      "\u201cWhen we looked at the schedule, the obvious place was to try to go to Tallahassee, where he played (at Florida State), but this game is so big. The fact that it\u2019s a noon game. It became a no-brainer to have it here,\u201d Herbstreit said. \u201cIt is very kind of storybook. The fact that we started with this and and end it here in Columbus.\u201d",
      "Corso has a 66.5% winning rate on his headgear predictions (286-144), which is much better than his 73-85-6 mark in 15 years as a coach at Louisville, Indiana, and Northern Illinois.",
      "His final headgear pick will be on the field at Ohio Stadium. Besides airing across all of ESPN\u2019s networks, Fox Sports may show part of it. The final hour of both pregame shows will also take place in the Horseshoe.",
      "Tom Rinaldi and Chris Fallica \u2014 former GameDay crew members now with Fox Sports \u2014 are also expected to give their thoughts on Corso\u2019s retirement.",

What was he going to do? Like that was going to determine who would win the game or not, but that was the beauty of the show, getting people excited about every Saturday for college football.\u201d",
      "GameDay producer Jim Gaiero thinks Corso may still have a surprise or two for Saturday. No one would be surprised if he led on that he was picking with Ohio State and ended up going with Texas.",
      "But even though Corso will no longer be a part of Saturday mornings for college football fans, his impact will continue to be felt.",
      "His ability to bring entertainment to a preview show helped get away from seriousness. You can be outrageous and still do your job, but you can still have fun,\u201d Gaiero said. \u201cI think other shows have tried to do that, even political shows.\u201d",

      "The nonprofit APOPO has worked in Morogoro, Tanzania, for more than two decades to train African giant pouched rats for lifesaving missions",
      "MOROGORO, Tanzania -- A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches: a rat with a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.",
      "Then a resounding click. A survivor has been found. The search in Morogoro in Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.",
      "\u201cTheir sense of smell is incredible,\u201d said Fabrizio Dell\u2019Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. \u201cThese rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis \u2014 even tiny amounts of the bacteria \u2014 and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.\u201d",
      "In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled with land mines as part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angola or Cambodia, where APOPO has helped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.",
      "From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these \u201chero rats\u201d have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.",
      "For decades APOPO has trained these \u201chero rats,\u201d which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.",
      "The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).",
      "It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell\u2019Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.",
      "While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world\u2019s most effective detectors of tuberculosis.",
      "\u201cEvery day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,\u201d said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \u201cIt\u2019s more spectacular to be on the minefield \u2026 but for TB \u2026 in terms of social impact, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",
      "Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. The World Health Organization said last October in its most recent TB report that the disease had resurged as the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.",
      "APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.",
      "With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.",
      "False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of using rats are significant,\u201d said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. \u201cThey help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.\u201d",

      "While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.",
      "\u201cHuman error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,\u201d said Stanesloaus. \u201cUsing rats is a very effective initiative.\u201d",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats can scan 100 samples in 20 minutes, and since the program's inception, the rats have been able to identify more than 30,000 patients who had been sent home with a clean bill of health but were actually carrying TB, said Cox. The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.",
      "Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.",
      "The more existential challenge for these \u201chero rats\u201d comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO\u2019s labs before treatment can be administered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d said Cox. \u201cNot being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB \u2026 never reaches us.\u201d",
      "Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.",
      "Regulators may also challenge APOPO\u2019s method of focusing on finding every single positive case possible at the cost of more potential false positives.",
      "APOPO relies on the indication of just one rat to proceed with further investigation into a possible positive case, while higher specificity standards may need multiple rats to flag a sample.",
      "Cox defends this approach.",

      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has brought his young daughter on a significant trip to China, marking her first known overseas appearance",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has brought his young daughter on his most significant foreign trip in years, a trip to China that marks his latest attempt to break out of isolation and bolster his position by balancing between traditional allies Moscow and Beijing.",
      "The girl is believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and is around 12 or 13 years old. Not much else is known about her.",
      "Since 2022, Kim Jong Un has showcased her at a growing number of major public events tied to his nuclear-armed military, fueling speculation she is being primed as the country's next leader.",
      "While North Korean state media have described Kim\u2019s daughter as \u201cbeloved\u201d and \u201crespected,\u201d they have never called her by name.",
      "The assumption that the girl's name is Ju Ae is based on an account by former NBA champion Dennis Rodman where he recalled holding Kim Jong Un\u2019s baby daughter during a trip to Pyongyang in 2013.",
      "Ju Ae's exact age is unconfirmed but South Korean intelligence officials believe she was born in 2013.",
      "In a closed-door briefing to lawmakers in 2023, South Korea\u2019s main spy agency said it believes Kim Jong Un and his wife Ri Sol Ju also have an older son and a younger third child whose gender is unknown.",
      "Kim Jong Un beamed as he stepped out of his family\u2019s iconic green armored train to shake hands with senior Chinese officials upon arrival in Beijing on Tuesday. He was closely followed by Ju Ae.",
      "Dressed in a navy pantsuit with her hair styled in a half-updo, a look reminiscent of her mother\u2019s public appearances, Ju Ae stood in front of senior North Korean officials, including Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui.",
      "However, she did not make a public appearance the next day as her father shared center stage with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in a massive military parade at Tiananmen Square. The parade demonstrated a deepening alignment between Washington\u2019s adversaries.",
      "Kim Jong Un chose to publicly unveil his little-known daughter at a major military event \u2014 a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile \u2014 in November 2022.",

      "State media released a series of photos of Kim and his daughter at the event, marking the first time her image was made public. She wore a white coat and red shoes as she watched a soaring missile from a distance and walked hand-in-hand with her father.",
      "The missile test marked the first in a series of major military events where Kim Jong Un displayed his daughter. Her carefully-crafted appearances have included missile tests, military parades, and the launch of a naval destroyer in April, an event hailed as a major step in expanding North Korea's nuclear arsenal. Kim Jong Un has recently expanded his daughter\u2019s public appearances beyond military events to include some of his most ambitious economic projects and cultural events, including the opening of a beach resort in June.",
      "Ju Ae's increasing number of public appearances and presence in state media has led to speculation that she is being primed as her father\u2019s successor. The theory has been further fueled by her first known foreign trip to China.",
      "South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service issued a careful assessment last year that it views Ju Ae as her father\u2019s likely successor, citing a comprehensive analysis of her public activities and the state protocols provided to her.",
      "However, the spy agency said there are still various possibilities regarding North Korea\u2019s power succession process because Kim Jong Un, 41, is still young, has no major health issues and has other children.",
      "Some South Korean officials and experts initially expressed doubts over Ju Ae as the future heir, citing North Korea's male-nominated power structure and Confucian influence.",
      "Since its foundation in 1948, North Korea has been successively ruled by male members of the Kim family. Kim Jong Un inherited power upon his father Kim Jong Il\u2019s death in late 2011. Kim Jong Il took over power after his father and state founder Kim Il Sung died in 1994.",
      "North Korea\u2019s state media have yet to make any direct comments on a power succession plan beyond Kim Jong Un. It has also not commented on whether Ju Ae has any siblings.",

      "Putin and Kim traveled from a formal reception to the negotiations in the same car, the Kremlin said in a post on social media.

Putin also invited Kim to visit Russia again, following on from the North Korean leader's last visit to the country in 2023.",

      "According to South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent around 15,000 troops to Russia since last year. It has also sent large quantities of military equipment, including ballistic missiles and artillery, to help fuel Putin\u2019s three-year invasion of Ukraine.",

      "There was no shortage of pageantry at Wednesday\u2019s military parade in Beijing, but beyond the spectacle, it also provided the first good look at China\u2019s latest military hardware",
      "BANGKOK -- Soldiers in pristine and pressed uniforms marched in lockstep, their boots clacking a steady cadence on the pavement and their eyes following leader Xi Jinping as he drove by in review. Helicopters flew overhead, forming the numbers 8 and 0 in honor of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.",
      "There was no shortage of pageantry at Wednesday's military parade in Beijing, but beyond the spectacle, it also provided the first good look at China's latest military hardware. New missiles, drones and other high-tech equipment have been added to its arsenal as part of a massive modernization program with the goal, according to the official parade announcers, of producing a force \u201cwith both nuclear and conventional capabilities able to deter wars in all battle spaces.\u201d",
      "Here are some of the highlights:",
      "China's nuclear arsenal still lags far behind that of the United States and Russia, but it has been rapidly expanding. In its annual report to Congress on China, the U.S. Department of Defense estimated that Beijing now has more than 600 warheads and will have more than 1,000 by 2030.",
      "The parade featured many of the missiles capable of delivering those warheads, from air, sea and land. China's official Xinhua News Agency said it was the first time the military's \u201ctriad of strategic nuclear forces was presented in a concentrated fashion,\u201d calling it \u201cChina's strategic trump card for safeguarding national sovereignty and defending national dignity.\u201d",
      "The display of the three systems together is noteworthy, said Meia Nouwens, senior fellow for Chinese security and defense policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "\u201cAll of that, of course, goes back to this key point about deterrence and the messaging that the PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) and Xi Jinping are seeking to send to the U.S. and other partners and allies in the region and further afield,\" she said.",
      "Among the nuclear-capable missiles seen was the DF-61, a new intercontinental ballistic missile which can be fired from a mobile launching platform. Details on its capabilities are scant, but its predecessor has a range of more than 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) and can carry multiple warheads. It also debuted the newest variant of the silo-based DF-5, the DF-5C, whose range has been estimated at 20,000 kilometers.",
      "Also featured were the JL-1 air-launched long-range missile and the JL-3 sea-launched missile, both of which are also nuclear-capable.",
      "The parade saw the debut of other new missiles, including several designed to attack ships. These are likely of particular interest to the U.S., whose naval power is a key component of its Asia-Pacific defense strategy.",
      "China claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its own, and Xi has not ruled out taking the island by force. In the event of a Chinese invasion, if the U.S. were to come to Taiwan's aid, China would need to hold off the U.S. Navy long enough to consolidate control of the island.",

      "A new study says climate change has made extreme weather conditions, like those fueling wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula, 40 times more likely",
      "MADRID -- The extremely hot, dry and windy conditions, which fueled one of the IberianPeninsula's most destructive wildfire seasons in recorded history, were 40 times more likely due to climate change, according to a study released Thursday.",
      "The analysis by World Weather Attribution, or WWA, said the weather conditions were about 30% more intense compared to the preindustrial era, when heavy reliance on fossil fuels began.",
      "Hundreds of wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula broke out in July and August. They spread rapidly thanks to temperatures that pushed above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and strong winds.",
      "The fires in Spain and Portugal killed eight people, forced more than 35,000 evacuations and scorched more than 640,000 hectares (1.58 million acres) or roughly two-thirds of Europe\u2019s total burned area this year.",
      "Most blazes are now under control, officials say, as temperatures have dropped considerably.",
      "\u201cHotter, drier and more flammable conditions are becoming more severe with climate change, and are giving rise to fires of unprecedented intensity,\u201d said Clair Barnes, a researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College, London.",
      "Europe has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, according to the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "WWA, a group of researchers that examines whether and to what extent extreme weather events are linked to climate change, focused on the conditions that allowed the Iberian wildfires to spread that fast, including during Spain's hottest ten-day period on record in August, according to the country's weather agency AEMET.",
      "Without climate change, similar ten-day spells of hot, dry and windy conditions would be rare, expected once every 500 years, they found.",

      "WWA's analysis wasn't a full attribution study. Those seek to determine the influence of climate change, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels, on a specific extreme weather event. This time, the researchers looked at weather observations without using climate models. But the results were consistent with existing research on wildfires in the region, the researchers said, and another study WWA recently published on this year's fires in Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, which found that climate change made fire-prone weather conditions there 10 times more likely.",
      "\u201cWhile fires are a characteristic of the Mediterranean climate, human-caused climate change increases the recurrence and severity of conditions favorable for intense fires, making fire control efforts much more challenging,\u201d Masson-Delmotte said.",
      "The researchers mentioned other factors that have contributed to the severity of the wildfires, including large population shifts that have taken place over decades in Spain and Portugal from the countryside to cities. The study said this has resulted in large areas of neglected overgrown farms and forests, which further fuel the fires.",
      "Removing vegetation using machinery, encouraging grazing by sheep, horses and goats and using other methods, such as controlled burns, would reduce the risk during wildfire seasons, researchers said.",
      "\u201cFrom a human perspective, most of these rural areas have suffered massive abandonment since the 1970s, which has allowed fine fuels to accumulate to dangerous levels, a problem worsened by inadequate forestry management,\u201d said Ricardo Trigo, a professor at the University of Lisbon's geophysics, geographical engineering and energy department.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Ned is a perfectly nice snail. If he had a dating profile, it might read: good listener, stable home, likes broccoli, seeks love.",
      "But he\u2019s already exhausted his local options and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s picky or unappealing. Instead, he\u2019s a common garden snail with an uncommon anatomical problem that\u2019s ruining his love life.",
      "Ned\u2019s shell coils to the left, not the right, making him the 1 in 40,000 snails whose sex organs don\u2019t line up with those of the rest of their species. Unless another lefty snail is found, the young gastropod faces a lifetime of unintentional celibacy.",
      "That dire prospect prompted a New Zealand nature lover who found the snail in her garden in August to launch a campaign to find his perfect match. But Ned\u2019s quest for true love, perhaps predictably, is slow.",
      "Giselle Clarkson was weeding her home vegetable patch in Wairarapa on the North Island when a snail tumbling out of the leafy greens caught her eye. Clarkson, the author and illustrator of a nature book, \u201cThe Observologist,\u201d has an affection for snails and had long been on the lookout for a sinistral, or left-coiled shell.",
      "\u201cI knew immediately that I couldn\u2019t just toss the snail back into the weeds with the others,\u201d she said. Instead, she sent a photo of the snail, pictured alongside a right-coiled gastropod as proof, to her colleagues at New Zealand Geographic.",
      "The magazine launched a nationwide campaign to find a mate for Ned, named for the left-handed character Ned Flanders in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who once opened a store called The Leftorium. That explains the male pronouns some use for Ned, although snails are hermaphrodites with sex organs on their necks and the capacity for both eggs and sperm.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a right-coiling snail and a left-coiling snail, they can\u2019t slide up and get their pieces meeting in the right position,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSo a lefty can only mate with another lefty.\u201d",
      "The fact that romantic hopefuls need not be a sex match should have boosted Ned\u2019s prospects. But his inbox has remained empty except for photos of \u201coptimistically misidentified right-coiling snails,\" Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of enthusiasm and encouragement for Ned, a lot of people who can relate and really want the best for them, as a symbol of hope for everyone who\u2019s looking for love,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as yet, no lefties have been forthcoming.\u201d",
      "Ned\u2019s relatable romantic woes have attracted global news coverage, but New Zealand\u2019s strict biosecurity controls mean long-distance love probably isn\u2019t on the cards. Other left-coiled snails have gotten lucky through public campaigns to find mates before, however, so Clarkson remains optimistic.",

      "Leader Xi Jinping, speaking before the parade, paid tribute to Chinese veterans of the war. Since coming to power in 2012, he has sought to build China into a country that cannot be bullied and is strong enough to stand up to foreign powers.",

      "Highlights of the weaponry in the parade included the AJX002 underwater drone, a long, black, tube-shaped craft that looks like a narrow submarine with a rear propeller.",
      "Other weapons that got attention were hypersonic missiles designed to take out ships at sea and a new intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-61, which could carry nuclear warheads to distant targets.",
      "The hypersonic weapons are of particular concern to the U.S. Navy, which patrols the western Pacific from its 7th Fleet headquarters in Japan.",
      "Fighter jets and bombers flew across the sky, some painting colored trails. Helicopters flew in formation, one group of 26 spelling out the number \u201c80\u201d for the war's anniversary year.",
      "The ceremony began with an 80-gun artillery salute, followed by the national anthem, the \u201cMarch of the Volunteers,\u201d a song composed in 1935 during the early years of resistance against invading Japanese forces.",
      "As the parade got underway, U.S. President Donald Trump said on social media that the big question is whether Xi will recognize the contributions of Americans who fought in the war.",
      "\u201cPlease give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America,\u201d he added.",

      "Xi rode the entire length of their formations along Beijing\u2019s central Chang\u2019an Avenue in a classic black limousine. He stood up through the vehicle\u2019s sunroof with four microphones lined in front of him and greeted flanks of personnel as he passed them and rows of armaments and military vehicles.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taipei resident Mu Chuhua caught some glimpses of China\u2019s mighty military parade on YouTube on Wednesday. As she watched hypersonic missiles roll down Beijing\u2019s Chang\u2019an Avenue and troops march in lockstep, she didn\u2019t feel like they posed a threat to Taiwan, the self-ruled island China claims as its own.",
      "Mu, a 69-year-old retiree, said she saw the parade as simply a way for Chinese President Xi Jinping to \u201csay thank you to the troops.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe lack of public reaction to China\u2019s display of military might reflects both the limits of Beijing\u2019s intimidation campaign against Taiwan and the longstanding concern of Taiwanese people becoming desensitized by the constant military threat posed by China,\u201d said William Yang, a senior Northeast Asia analyst for the International Crisis Group.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially a double-edged sword,\u201d Yang added. \u201cOn the one hand, China\u2019s attempt to regularize military operations around Taiwan in recent years has forced Taiwanese people to view these activities as part of a \u2018new normal\u2019 in their everyday life. However, China\u2019s increasing military presence also reduces the effect of these intimidation tactics on the Taiwanese public.\u201d",
      "Taiwan\u2019s government used the event to renew alarm over Beijing\u2019s military intimidation of the island. China sends military jets and ships near Taiwan almost daily and hasn\u2019t renounced the use the force to take over the territory, which it considers a breakaway province.",
      "Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te said in a speech Tuesday ahead of the island\u2019s Armed Forces Day that the \u201csecurity environment\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating China from Taiwan, was \u201cmore severe than ever before.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s military intimidation and alleged cognitive warfare tactics are \u201cnot only a threat to Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom but also a challenge to the entire democratic world,\u201d Lai said.

      "The nonprofit APOPO has worked in Morogoro, Tanzania, for more than two decades to train African giant pouched rats for lifesaving missions",
      "MOROGORO, Tanzania -- A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches: a rat with a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.",
      "Then a resounding click. A survivor has been found. The search in Morogoro in Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.",
      "\u201cTheir sense of smell is incredible,\u201d said Fabrizio Dell\u2019Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. \u201cThese rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis \u2014 even tiny amounts of the bacteria \u2014 and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.\u201d",
      "In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled with land mines as part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angola or Cambodia, where APOPO has helped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.",
      "From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these \u201chero rats\u201d have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.",
      "For decades APOPO has trained these \u201chero rats,\u201d which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.",
      "The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).",
      "It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell\u2019Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.",
      "While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world\u2019s most effective detectors of tuberculosis.",
      "\u201cEvery day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,\u201d said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \u201cIt\u2019s more spectacular to be on the minefield \u2026 but for TB \u2026 in terms of social impact, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",
      "Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. The World Health Organization said last October in its most recent TB report that the disease had resurged as the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.",
      "APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.",
      "With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.",
      "False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of using rats are significant,\u201d said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. \u201cThey help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.\u201d",

      "TB detection has made significant advances in recent years, including using artificial intelligence tools in conjunction with lung scans. However, many areas that are burdened most by TB, such as rural villages or low-income urban communities, do not have access to these tools.",
      "While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.",
      "\u201cHuman error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,\u201d said Stanesloaus. \u201cUsing rats is a very effective initiative.\u201d",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats can scan 100 samples in 20 minutes, and since the program's inception, the rats have been able to identify more than 30,000 patients who had been sent home with a clean bill of health but were actually carrying TB, said Cox. The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.",
      "Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.",
      "The more existential challenge for these \u201chero rats\u201d comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO\u2019s labs before treatment can be administered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d said Cox. \u201cNot being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB \u2026 never reaches us.\u201d",
      "Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.",
      "Regulators may also challenge APOPO\u2019s method of focusing on finding every single positive case possible at the cost of more potential false positives.",
      "APOPO relies on the indication of just one rat to proceed with further investigation into a possible positive case, while higher specificity standards may need multiple rats to flag a sample.",
      "Cox defends this approach.",
      "\u201cOur choice was to go for that last patient out there \u2014 to go for the social impact,\u201d said Cox.",

But while U.S. President Donald Trump has hinted his country will be involved, he has moved away from calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine and refrained from implementing tough additional economic measures to punish Moscow.",
      "Although Trump said he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Russian President Vladimir Putin and issued several threats to try to cajole him into negotiating an end to hostilities, none has worked.

      "While Trump and European leaders met in Washington after the Alaska summit \u2014 and U.S., European and NATO military chiefs held discussions on support for Ukraine \u2014 little concrete detail has emerged on the security guarantees to deter Moscow from a future conflict.",

      "Supporters of Linehan say U.K. laws are stifling legitimate comment and creating what \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling \u2013- like Linehan, a critic of trans activism \u2014 called \u201ctotalitarianism.\u201d",
      "Others argue that online abuse and hate speech have real-world impact and police have a duty to take it seriously. London's police chief said ambiguities in the law had left officers \u201cin an impossible position.\u201d",
      "Linehan, the co-creator of beloved 1990s sitcom \u201cFather Ted\u201d and other shows including \u201cThe IT Crowd,\u201d says he was detained by five armed police officers on Monday at Heathrow Airport as he returned from Arizona.",
      "Linehan, who has been outspoken in his assertions that trans women are men, said on X in April that trans women were violent criminals if they used women-only facilities. He advocated people \u201cpunch\u201d them if calling police and other measures failed to stop them.",
      "The post came days after the head of the U.K\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Commission said transgender women would be excluded from women-only spaces such as toilets, single-sex hospital wards and sports teams. The decision followed a ruling by Britain\u2019s highest court that the terms \u201cwoman\u201d and \u201cman\u201d refer to biological sex for antidiscrimination purposes.",
      "Another post by Linehan referred to trans-rights protesters and said \u201cI hate them.\u201d",
      "The Metropolitan Police force didn\u2019t name Linehan but said it had arrested a man in his 50s at the airport on suspicion of inciting violence in posts on X.",
      "Linehan, 57, said on Substack that he had been \u201carrested for jokes.\u201d He said the questioning by police sent his blood pressure soaring and he was taken to a hospital before being released on bail, on condition he doesn't post on X.",
      "Linehan is due to appear in a London court on Thursday in a separate case in which he is accused of harassing a transgender woman and damaging her phone. He denies the charge.",
      "Supporters of Linehan condemned his arrest, saying it amounted to the policing of opinion.",
      "\u201cThis is totalitarianism. Utterly deplorable,\u201d Rowling wrote on X.",
      "The tabloid Sun said there was \u201coutrage\u201d at the arrest of the \u201cFather Ted genius.\u201d The right-leaning Daily Mail asked \u201cWhen did Britain become North Korea?\u201d",
      "Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time this government told the police their job is to protect the public, not monitor social media for hurty words.\u201d",
      "But Zack Polanski, leader of the Green Party, said the posts were \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d and the arrest seemed \u201cproportionate.\"",
      "The right to freedom of speech is protected under Britain\u2019s Human Rights Act, but it has limits. Inciting violence is illegal, as is hate speech directed at people on grounds including race, gender, sexuality and religion.",

      "Not all the criticism comes from the right. Civil liberties campaigners say authorities have gone too far in limiting peaceful protest, citing a July decision to ban the group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization.

      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer pushed back against criticism, saying Wednesday he is \u201cvery proud\u201d of Britain\u2019s long history of free speech.

      "NEW YORK -- C-SPAN said Wednesday that it had reached a deal to have its three channels air on YouTube TV and Hulu's live television feed, ending a dispute that had led to a revenue squeeze for the public affairs network in the cord-cutting era.",
      "The network said the streaming services would pay the same fee as cable and satellite companies, roughly 87 cents a year per subscriber, and that C-SPAN would continue its no-advertising policy on television.",
      "Congress involved itself in the issue, passing a resolution this spring calling on the services' parent companies \u2014 Alphabet for YouTube and Disney for Hulu \u2014 to add C-SPAN to their programming mix. Because congressional sessions and hearings represent a big portion of C-SPAN's programming, the politicians faced diminished airtime without a deal.",
      "At its peak a decade ago, C-SPAN was seen in some 100 million homes with television. The number of homes paying for TV has since dropped to some 70 million, with roughly 20 million of those consumers now getting television through services like YouTube and Hulu, and they weren't showing C-SPAN.",
      "C-SPAN said its revenues had dropped from nearly $64 million in 2019 to $45.4 million in 2023.",

The incident has renewed \u2014 for a different president \u2014 questions about how journalists should handle the sensitive issue of how healthy an aging leader of the free world actually is.",

      "A year ago, President Joe Biden, now 82, abandoned his reelection effort after a halting, confused performance in a debate with Trump provoked concerns about his ability to serve another four-year term. Journalists who covered the White House faced attacks for not doing enough to investigate Biden's health and condition.",
      "Trump, who turned 79 in June, is the oldest person to be inaugurated as president.

Gretchen Whitmer last month as \u201cKristi.\u201d",

      "The White House has said Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which means veins in the legs can\u2019t properly carry blood back to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower legs. It\u2019s a fairly common condition for older adults.",
      "As far as the bruising, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it\u2019s from \u201cfrequent handshaking and the use of aspirin,\u201d which Trump takes regularly to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. Easy bruising in general could have several relatively benign causes, including old age or side effects from medications like blood thinners.",

      "Beyond punditry, however, news outlets face serious questions about how to handle the story, much like they did with Biden. The physical signs that have been pointed out online should trigger serious probes into the president's health. Some critics, like historian Garrett Graff, said it was puzzling that many in the media hadn't treated it like a news story \u2014 although the timing over a holiday weekend surely made it more challenging.",

      "Given all that, Graff wrote in a Substack post that \u201cyou'd think reporters would be falling all over themselves to dig deeper right now. Clearly, there's enough smoke to warrant at least a major story in a major outlet investigating whether there is fire.\u201d",

      "It's an issue uniting the left and the right",
      "WASHINGTON -- An unusual alliance emerged in the House on Wednesday as lawmakers, who agree on little else, rallied support for a bill that would prohibit members of Congress and their families from owning and trading individual stocks.",
      "The group included darlings of the far right, the left, moderates and many in between. They gathered to promote a ban that polls well with voters and appears to be finding new momentum after stalling out in previous sessions of Congress.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not every day you see this cast of characters up here,\u201d said Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican who represents a perennial swing district in Pennsylvania. \"You\u2019re all smirking out there. That\u2019s a good thing. It speaks to the power of this cause.\u201d",
      "Congress has discussed proposals for years to keep lawmakers from engaging in trading individual stocks, nodding to the idea that there\u2019s a potential conflict of interest when they are often privy to information and decisions that can dramatically move markets.",
      "A Senate committee has approved legislation from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents \u2014 while notably exempting Republican President Donald Trump. The House bill unveiled this week is limited to Congress, but the sponsors said they were open to extending it to the executive branch if enough support emerged.",
      "Under current law, federal lawmakers are required to disclose their stock sales and purchases. The bill requiring disclosure, The Stock Act, was signed into law in 2012. At the time, lawmakers and government watchdogs predicted that public disclosure would shame lawmakers out of actively buying and selling stock. That hasn\u2019t happened.",
      "The sponsors said they merged their own, individual bills on banning stocks and came together with a single bipartisan effort. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, the bill's lead sponsor, said that the group had been meeting for the last several months, and some sponsors had actually been working on this for years. About a dozen lawmakers from both parties joined Roy on stage. It was an unusually festive moment as the partisan lines in Congress have rarely been sharper.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t agree with some of these people on anything,\u201d said Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican often aligned with the the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus.",
      "Progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. followed Burchett to the podium and fist-bumped him when doing so. She said she felt like the coalition showed how Congress should actually work. \u201cIt feels foreign and it feels alien and it\u2019s like, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d she said.",

Lawmakers who currently own individual stocks and bonds would have 180 days to divest. New members would have 90 days to divest upon taking office.",
      "The mood was celebratory at Wednesday's unveiling, but even if the bill were to pass the House, it would face a more difficult climb in the Senate. At least 60 votes would be needed to advance the legislation in that chamber and some senators have expressed concerns about the concept.",
      "Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., acknowledged that members opposed to banning stocks are \u201cpersistent.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose of us who support banning stock trading in Congress are very vocal in our position, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t opponents,\u201d Magaziner said.",

    "story": [
      "Leaving devices plugged in can result in phantom energy, which is the power consumed by appliances that draw electricity even when they\u2019re turned off or not in use",
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\u201cPhantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they\u2019ve improved over time,\u201d said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\u201cThe good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\u201d said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\u201cJust take a little step of unplugging the things that you\u2019re not using,\u201d said Charron. \u201cIt will save you money and it\u2019ll save emissions in the long run.\u201d",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\u201cDo you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you\u2019re not using it?\u201d said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",

      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you\u2019re not using that could be draining energy help, too. For example, smart televisions often have optional features that can be turned off so the television isn't listening for signals from other devices while in standby mode.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not using it, then you\u2019re getting no benefit, yet you\u2019re paying the price and increased the energy use,\u201d said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cThe question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\u201d said Gilligan. \u201cPhantom power is one part of this.\u201d",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don\u2019t want to feel like they\u2019re being irresponsible.",
      "\u201cThis is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\u201d said Giligan.",
      "When it comes to daily choices, individuals may think what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t really making a big difference. But what they tend to overlook is how they influence others around them by choosing to live a more sustainable life.",

      "The provision in the law signed by President Donald Trump in July eliminates federal income taxes on tips for people working in jobs that have traditionally received them. It's temporary and runs from 2025 until 2028. It applies to people who make less than $160,000 in 2025.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab estimates that there were roughly 4 million workers in tipped occupations in 2023, which amounts to roughly 2.5% of all jobs.",
      "The administration was required to publish a list of qualifying occupations within 90 days of the bill\u2019s signing. The full list of occupations is located on the Treasury Department website.",
      "They are broken down into eight categories, including beverage and food service; entertainment and events; hospitality and guest services; home services; personal services; personal appearance and wellness; recreation and instruction; and transportation and delivery.",
      "Among other jobs exempted from tax on tips are sommeliers, cocktail waiters, pastry chefs, cake bakers, bingo workers, club dancers, DJs, clowns, streamers, online video creators, ushers, maids, gardeners, electricians, house cleaners, tow truck drivers, wedding planners, personal care aides, tutors, au pairs, massage therapists, yoga instructors, cobblers, skydiving pilots, ski instructors, parking garage attendants, delivery drivers and movers.",

      "A report from the Budget Lab shows that the effects of the law would be small, given that tipped workers tend to be lower income. More than 37% of tipped workers, or over one third, earned income low enough that they faced no federal income tax in 2022.",
      "\u201cThe larger and far more uncertain effect would stem from behavioral changes incentivized by the bill, such as substitution into tipped employment and tipped income, which would increase the bill\u2019s overall cost,\u201d states the report, which was written by Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Budget Lab.",
      "Congressional budget analysts project the \u201cNo Tax on Tips\u201d provision would increase the deficit by $40 billion through 2028. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in June that the tips deduction will cost $32 billion over 10 years.",

Torii declined to give many details, saying the case was still under investigation. Police in Fukuoka, southwestern Japan, confirmed Niinami was being investigated in a possible drug case without giving further details.",
      "Niinami said Wednesday the case involved a health supplement he called \u201ca CBD supplement\u201d that was made in the U.S. and recommended by a friend who sent it to him by mail. CBD stands for \u201ccannabidiol\u201d and contains a component of marijuana.",
      "Niinami assumed the supplement was \u201clegal 100%\u201d and he wanted to try the product, which was cheaper than versions sold in Japan, to help relieve jet lag from overseas trips. He was traveling when the package arrived and he did not receive it, he said.",
      "\u201cI want to apologize to society,\u201d Niinami, 66, said after bowing deeply. He noted Suntory makes supplements in addition to whisky, beer and non-alcoholic beverages, so his actions showed carelessness.",
      "Niinami is credited with guiding strong growth at Suntory, founded in 1899, including its overseas expansion such as the acquisition of Beam Inc. for $16 billion a decade ago. That deal included iconic brands such as Jim Beam Bourbon, Sauza Tequila and Canadian Club Whisky and helped make Suntory a well-known alcoholic brand in the U.S.",

      "A hearing in Texas could be the final chance for families of Boeing 737 Max crash victims to demand criminal prosecution of the company",
      "DALLAS -- A hearing set for Wednesday in federal court in Texas could provide families of the victims killed in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners with their final opportunity to demand that the company face criminal prosecution.",
      "U.S. District Chief Judge Reed O'Connor will hear arguments on a motion by the federal government to dismiss a felony fraud charge against Boeing in connection with the crashes that killed 346 people off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia. In exchange, Boeing said it would pay or invest another $1.1 billion in fines, compensation for the crash victims\u2019 families, and internal safety and quality measures.",
      "Prosecutors have said that Boeing deceived government regulators about a flight-control system that was later implicated in the fatal flights, which happened less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019.",
      "The hearing in Fort Worth comes more than four years after the Justice Department first announced it had charged Boeing in January 2021 and reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the aircraft maker. That deal would have protected Boeing from criminal prosecution if it strengthened its ethics and legal compliance programs, but prosecutors revived the charge last year after they said Boeing had violated the agreement.",
      "Boeing decided to plead guilty instead of going to trial, but in December 2024, O\u2019Connor rejected that plea agreement. O'Connor, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, cited concerns he had over how diversity policies both at the federal government and at Boeing could influence the selection of an independent monitor charged with overseeing the company's promised reforms.",
      "Lawyers representing relatives of some of the victims who want a public trial and for the company to receive more severe financial punishment welcomed the judge's decision. But the delay worked in Boeing's favor.",
      "The judge\u2019s refusal to accept the agreement meant the company was free to challenge the Justice Department\u2019s rationale for charging Boeing as a corporation. It also meant prosecutors would have to secure a new deal for a guilty plea, and they spent six months renegotiating with Boeing.",
      "During that time, President Donald Trump returned to office and ordered an end to the diversity initiatives that gave O\u2019Connor pause.",
      "By late May, the two sides struck a new deal that took both the criminal charge and Boeing's guilty plea off the table. The Justice Department said it offered those terms in light of \u201csignificant changes\u201d Boeing has made to its quality control and anti-fraud programs since last summer.",
      "O\u2019Connor has invited some of the families to speak on Wednesday. That includes relatives traveling from France, Ireland and Canada who plan to ask the judge to deny the government\u2019s request and appoint a special prosecutor to take over the case, according to lawyers for the families.",
      "Chris and Clariss Moore of Toronto, whose 24-year-old daughter, Danielle, died when a 737 Max crashed shortly after takeoff from Ethiopia\u2019s Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, said in a statement that the pending agreement would allow Boeing to escape justice.",

The Justice Department has also asked the judge to leave open the possibility of refiling the conspiracy charge if the company does not hold up its end of the deal over the next two years.",
      "The department said it thought that persuading a jury to punish the company with a criminal conviction would be risky, while the new deal ensures \"meaningful accountability, delivers substantial and immediate public benefits, and brings finality to a difficult and complex case whose outcome would otherwise be uncertain.\u201d",
      "While federal judges typically defer to the discretion of prosecutors in such situations, court approval is not automatic.",
      "The yearslong case centers around a software system that Boeing developed for the Max, which began flying in 2017.",
      "In the 2018 and 2019 crashes, that software pitched the nose of the plane down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor, and pilots flying then-new planes for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines were unable to regain control. After the Ethiopia crash, the planes were grounded worldwide for 20 months while the company redesigned the software.",
      "Investigators found that Boeing did not inform key Federal Aviation Administration personnel about changes it had made to the software before regulators set pilot training requirements for the Max and certified the airliner for flight.",
      "Acting on the incomplete information, prosecutors said, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737 pilots, avoiding the need for flight simulators that would have made it more expensive for airlines to adopt the latest version of the jetliner.",
      "The initial 2021 settlement agreement was on the verge of expiring last year when a panel covering an unused emergency exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight over Oregon. No one was seriously injured, but it put Boeing\u2019s safety record under renewed scrutiny.",

      "A decline in foreign visitors traveling to the United States has stretched well into the summer",
      "LAS VEGAS -- For a few hopeful weeks this summer, a bright billboard on the major highway linking Toronto to New York greeted Canadian drivers with a simple message: \"Buffalo Loves Canada.\u201d",
      "The marketing campaign, which included a $500 gift card giveaway, was meant to show Buffalo's northern neighbors they were welcome, wanted and missed.",
      "At first, it seemed like it might work, said Patrick Kaler, CEO of the local tourism organization Visit Buffalo Niagara. More than 1,000 people entered the giveaway. But by the end of July, it was clear the city's reliable summer wave of Canadian visitors would not arrive this year.",
      "Buffalo\u2019s struggle reflects a broader downturn in international tourism to the U.S. that travel analysts warn could persist well into the future. From northern border towns to major hot spots like Las Vegas and Los Angeles, popular travel destinations reported hosting fewer foreign visitors this summer.",
      "Experts and some local officials attribute the trend that first emerged in February to President Donald Trump's return to the White House. They say his tariffs, immigration crackdown and repeated jabs about the U.S. acquiring Canada and Greenland alienated travelers from other parts of the world.",
      "\"To see the traffic drop off so significantly, especially because of rhetoric that can be changed, is so disheartening,\u201d Kaler said.",
      "The World Travel & Tourism Council projected ahead of Memorial Day that the U.S. would be the only country among the 184 it studied where foreign visitor spending would fall in 2025. The finding was \u201ca clear indicator that the global appeal of the U.S. is slipping,\u201d the global industry association said.",
      "\u201cThe world\u2019s biggest travel and tourism economy is heading in the wrong direction,\u201d Julia Simpson, the council\u2019s president and CEO, said. \"While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the \u2018closed\u2019 sign.\u201d",
      "Travel research firm Tourism Economics, meanwhile, predicted this month that the U.S. would see 8.2% fewer international arrivals in 2025, an improvement from its earlier forecast of a 9.4% decline but well below the numbers of foreign visitors to the country before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThe sentiment drag has proven to be severe,\u201d the firm said, noting that airline bookings indicate \u201cthe sharp inbound travel slowdown\u201d of May, June and July would likely persist in the months ahead.",
      "Deborah Friedland, managing director at the financial services firm Eisner Advisory Group, said he U.S. travel industry faced multiple headwinds \u2014 rising travel costs, political uncertainty and ongoing geopolitical tensions.",
      "Since returning to office, Trump has doubled down on some of the hard-line policies that defined his first term, reviving a travel ban targeting mainly African and Middle Eastern countries, tightening rules around visa approvals and ramping up mass immigration raids. At the same time, the push for tariffs on foreign goods that quickly became a defining feature of his second term gave some citizens elsewhere a sense they were unwanted.",
      "\u201cPerception is reality,\u201d Friedland said.",
      "Organizers of an international swing dancing said an impression of America's hostility to foreigners led them to postpone the event, which had been scheduled to take place this month in the Harlem area of New York City.",
      "About three months into Trump\u2019s second term, international competitors began pulling out of the world finals of the International Lindy Hop Championships, saying they felt unwelcome, event co-producer Tena Morales said. About half of attendees each year come from outside the U.S., primarily from Canada and France, she said.",
      "Contest organizers are considering whether to host the annual competition in another country until Trump's presidency ends, Morales said.",

The number of overseas visitors, a category that doesn't include travelers from Mexico or Canada, declined by more than 3 million, or 1.6%, compared to the same period a year earlier, according to preliminary figures from the National Travel and Tourism Office.",
      "As a tourist generator, Western Europe was down 2.3%, with visitors from Denmark dropping by 19%, from Germany by 10%, and from France by 6.6%. A similar pattern surfaced in Asia, where the U.S. data showed double-digit decreases in arrivals from Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines. Fewer residents of countries throughout Africa also had traveled to the U.S. as of July.",
      "However, visitors from some countries, among them Argentina, Brazil, Italy and Japan, have arrived in greater numbers.",
      "Neither did all U.S. destinations report sluggish summers for tourism.",
      "On eastern Wisconsin\u2019s Door Peninsula, which straddles Lake Michigan and Green Bay, a steady stream of loyal Midwest visitors helped deliver a strong summer for local businesses, according to Jon Jarosh, a spokesperson for Destination Door County.",
      "Many business owners reported a noticeable uptick in foot traffic after a quieter start to the season, Jarosh said, and sidewalks were bustling and restaurants were packed by midsummer.",
      "Executives from the major U.S. airlines said last month that American passengers booking premium airfares helped fill their international flights and that demand for domestic flights was picking up after a weaker than expected showing in the first half of 2025.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said it was gearing up for what is expected to be the busiest Labor Day weekend in 15 years. Bookings for U.S. airlines were up about 2% compared to 2024 for the long holiday weekend that started Thursday, aviation analytics firm Cirium said.",
      "As the summer winds down, though, the absence of foreign visitors in Buffalo was still visible, according to Kaler, the head of Visit Buffalo Niagara.",
      "Canada sent over 20.2 million visitors to the U.S. last year, more than any other country, U.S. government data showed. But this year, residents of Canada have been among the most reluctant to visit.",
      "In a major U-turn, more U.S. residents drove into Canada in June and July than Canadians making the reverse trip, according to Canada\u2019s national statistical agency. Statistics Canada said it was the first time that happened in nearly two decades with the exception of two months during the pandemic.",
      "In July alone, the number of Canadian residents returning from the U.S. by car was down 37% from the year before, and return trips by plane fell 26%, the agency said.",
      "As a result, Visit Buffalo Niagara shifted its marketing efforts this summer to cities like Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago. Amateur children\u2019s sporting events also helped fill the void left by Canadian tourists.",
      "\u201cWe will always welcome Canadians back when the time is right,\u201d Kaler said. \u201cI don\u2019t want Canadians to feel like we see them as just dollar signs or a transaction at our cash registers. They mean more to us that that.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration's effort to freeze billions in funds for nonprofits running a \"green bank\" for climate-friendly projects",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration was handed a win by a federal appeals court on Tuesday in its effort to freeze billions of dollars and terminate contracts for nonprofits to run a \u201cgreen bank\u201d aimed at financing climate-friendly projects.",
      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency had blasted the Biden-era program as a waste of taxpayer money, tried to claw back funding that had already been distributed and accused the nonprofits of mismanagement \u2014 misuse accusations that Justice Department lawyers did not back up in court.",
      "The decision by the 2-1 majority on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit finds that federal officials have broad latitude to cancel funds that have been appropriated by Congress without facing allegations in federal district court that they broke the law. A strongly worded dissent said the outcome was a loss not just for the five green bank groups who sued the EPA, but for the authority of Congress to write policy and maintain its traditional power of the purse.",
      "In an opinion written by Judge Neomi Rao, the appeals court said the dispute should be heard in a federal claims court that considers contract disputes. Rao was appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term.",
      "\u201cIn sum, district courts have no jurisdiction to hear claims that the federal government terminated a grant agreement arbitrarily or with impunity. Claims of arbitrary grant termination are essentially contractual,\u201d Rao wrote in a decision supported by Judge Gregory Katsas, also a Trump appointee.",
      "The green bank groups said the federal claims court is limited to awarding possible monetary damages. The groups were seeking an order allowing them immediate access to their funds, which total about $16 billion.",
      "EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch said in a statement that the decision reaffirmed EPA's \"duty to be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see reason prevail in the court system,\" she said.",
      "A lower court had previously said the EPA couldn\u2019t support Administrator Lee Zeldin\u2019s accusations of wrongdoing and that the nonprofits should not have their contracts terminated and must have access to certain funding that had been frozen. The majority ruling overturned that decision Tuesday, although the order won\u2019t go into effect immediately to allow for an opportunity to appeal.",
      "The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a \u201cgreen bank,\u201d was authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the climate law approved by congressional Democrats. However, its goals run counter to the Trump administration\u2019s opposition to climate-friendly policies and its embrace of fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the billions in grants as a \u201cgold bar\u201d scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.",
      "In terminating the grants, Zeldin cited a conservative journalist\u2019s undercover video made late last year that showed a former EPA employee saying the agency was throwing \u201cgold bars off the Titanic\u201d \u2014 presumably a reference to spending before the end of Biden's term.",
      "In a February interview with Fox News, Zeldin said he suspected the green bank \u201cwas a clear-cut case of waste and abuse\u201d and an example of what he called \u201cself-dealing\u201d among the Biden administration and like-minded groups.",
      "The appeals court said the lower court was too quick to dismiss the EPA's concerns that the program lacked sufficient oversight.",

      "\u201cThe court disregarded the government\u2019s interest in prudent management of the grant programs and the government\u2019s representations that it planned to properly supervise, rather than abandon, the grantmaking process,\u201d Rao wrote.",
      "Climate United Fund and four other groups sued the EPA, Zeldin and Citibank, which held the grant money on behalf of the agency, saying they had illegally denied the groups access to funds awarded last year. They wanted access to those funds again, saying the freeze had paralyzed their work and jeopardized their basic operations.",
      "Climate United CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement Tuesday, \u201cThis is not the end of our road.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile we are disappointed by the panel\u2019s decision, we stand firm on the merits of our case: EPA unlawfully froze and terminated funds that were legally obligated and disbursed,\u201d Bafford said.",
      "Amir Kirkwood, CEO of the Justice Climate Fund, said the ruling \u201dhurts America\u2019s under-resourced communities, stalling hundreds of American-made clean energy projects across the country.\u2033",
      "Judge Cornelia Pillard, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, said in a sharply worded dissent that the green bank groups provided evidence that the EPA simply disagreed with the program's goals and tried to end it, while throwing around allegations against the groups it couldn't support.",
      "\"Those unprecedented and unfounded actions were part of EPA\u2019s hunt for reasons to shut down the congressionally mandated program and claw back the funding that had already been disbursed to Plaintiffs and committed to infrastructure projects,'' she wrote.",
      "\u201cThe majority allows the government to seize plaintiffs' money based on spurious and pretextual allegations and to permanently gut implementation of major congressional legislation designed to improve the infrastructure, health and economic security of communities throughout the country,\u201d she said, adding the lower court was right to block the termination of the grants.",
      "Camille Pannu, an associate clinical professor at Columbia Law School, said the split ruling shows \u201cwhat happens when courts are politicized.\" For an agency to \u201coverrule Congress and decide not to spend legally appropriated money is surprising and seems like an overreach,'' she said in an interview.",
      "\u201cIf the government is not honoring legally binding contracts, that's a problem,\" Pannu said.",

      "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- North Carolina's opening-night show under Bill Belichick was a flop. The only good news is there's little time to dwell on it.",
      "Instead, Belichick's first college team is hurtling straight from a 48-14 loss to TCU on Labor Day to Saturday's kickoff at Charlotte, a brisk turnaround for a team with a long list of items on the repair list.",
      "\u201cYou can't particpate in a game like that and not feel like there's some things you could've done better or you'd like to do over again,\u201d Belichick said Wednesday. \"Learn from those, move on and get ready for Charlotte. That's all we can control.",
      "\u201cWe need to learn some lessons from what happened in the TCU game. But at the same time, there's nothing we can do about that one, it's over with, and we need to move on.\u201d",
      "UNC turned to the 73-year-old coach who won six Super Bowls in leading the NFL's New England Patriots in a bid to elevate a program beyond decades of also-ran status, including paying Belichick a guaranteed $10 million for each of his first three seasons.",
      "Things began with a brief high point of a crisp season-opening touchdown drive and an immediate defensive stand. What followed was a gamelong descent that picked up speed on the way to a third-quarter crash that emptied out a packed Kenan Stadium well before the final period, all coming with the eyes of the college football world locked on Chapel Hill.",
      "Belichick said the goal now was to move past the TCU loss \u201cas fast as we can\u201d and sort out what works, what doesn't and what can improve quickly.",
      "\u201cI think as a coach you always try to do what\u2019s best for your team, period, whatever that is,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cSo you try to put players in the best position you can put them in. That\u2019s your job as a coach.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve always tried to do, is give my players an opportunity to go out there and play well and do things they\u2019re confident in doing and capable of doing. I\u2019d say based on Monday night, I need to do a better job of that.\u201d",
      "By the end, UNC had given up the most points in an opener in program history. The Horned Frogs also posted the highest score allowed by a Belichick-coached team at any level going back to his 29-year run as an NFL head coach, the previous high being 47 points against the Buffalo Bills in a 2021 wild-card playoff game.",
      "TCU scored 41 straight points after falling behind 7-0. That also created a rare scenario: there had been only four games in Belichick's 511 NFL regular-season and playoff games that he had trailed by at least 34 points.",
      "One of those was a 41-14 loss at Kansas City in September 2014, prompting Belichick's famous \u201cWe\u2019re on to Cincinnati\u201d repeated response to reporters\u2019 questions in a year that ended with the Pats winning title No. 4 under Belichick.",

      "LONDON -- Players at the Women's Rugby World Cup are more than happy to proudly call their teammates their sisters.",
      "Time together often rivals time with their actual families. Long before they lace up their boots and play, the players spent hours and hours together in the gym, in training, and in hotels and buses.",
      "But among the sisterhood there are some bonafide sisters sprinkled among the 16 teams in England, and here's some of their stories:",
      "The Bremners grew up on a farm in a town of 200. They were unflashy, reliable, tough, and each other's biggest supporter.",
      "Alana, younger than Chelsea by nearly two years at 28, started rugby like many women do, in a mixed team as a kid. Her determination was obvious. First-class debut at 17, Canterbury player of the year at 18, captain at 23.",
      "Alana persuaded Chelsea, at 21, to switch from netball to rugby. Chelsea found her niche. The lock didn't lose in her first 43 games for Canterbury and first 15 tests for New Zealand.",
      "Chelsea was picked first for the Black Ferns in 2020. Her first opponent was a Barbarians side captained by Alana. They didn't tackle each other.",
      "Alana was first to a test debut in 2021. Their first test together was in 2022 against Australia.",
      "They played the entire 2022 World Cup final win over England at Eden Park. They're at their second World Cup and locked together against Spain on the opening weekend.",
      "\u201cSometimes we underestimate how cool this situation is; to be in it at the same time,\u201d Alana told Rugby Pass.",
      "The Feleus were born in France but grew up on the French island of Futuna, between Fiji and Samoa. Their father, a sports teacher, coached them. In 1993, Mana\u00e9 played with France men's international Yoram Moefana in an under-11 tournament on Wallis; she was the scrumhalf, he was the flyhalf. They won.",
      "\u201cOne day (at age 7) I tried it out and it just clicked,\u201d T\u00e9ani told the Six Nations website. \u201cI was free to express myself however I wanted to in rugby. I had more fun. I let off more steam. As soon as I started rugby, I knew it was the sport I wanted to do. I was in it to have fun.\u201d",
      "These days a lock, Mana\u00e9 debuted for Les Bleues in 2020 and rose to captain in 2023. She was nominated this year for the best Six Nations player.",
      "T\u00e9ani, three years younger at 22, plays with Mana\u00e9 at Grenoble Amazones and moved from France's sevens to 15s in 2024. They both played against Italy on the World Cup\u2019s opening weekend.",
      "Also known as Bella and Ella, the Manusina's youngest players and first twins turn 21 this Sunday. Christabelle is a flanker and Demielle is a lock/flanker. Both played in Samoa's World Cup pool games against Australia and England.",
      "They may have been destined to play for Samoa. Their father, Setu Tuilaepa, represented Samoa in 15s and sevens and was their first coach. Their mother, Beth Onesemo, managed their youth teams and was a Rugby Samoa board member.",
      "Their first big splash was in rugby league, representing New Zealand last year on Australia's Gold Coast in a championship for rising women's talent. Before then, they admitted to googling the rules of rugby league on the car drive to their first game.",
      "Back in rugby union, they made their test debuts in June against Tonga. One of their older sisters, Rialani, debuted for Manusina later that month against Australia A.",
      "\u201cGrowing up, playing rugby, the resources we had were limited,\u201d Christabelle told ABC Australia. \u201cWe didn't get to go to the gym, we just had to train with what we had. Looking how far we've come, (we're) just grateful to be where we are and what we've become.\u201d",
      "Keilamarita and Risaleaana, better known as Risi, are daughters of a Samoan mother, Lealofi, and New Zealand Maori father, Kevin. They moved as kids from Australia to New Zealand.",
      "Risi earned her first-class debut and first national contract at 17, and two years later in 2019 she began playing sevens for New Zealand. She won Olympic gold in Tokyo and Paris. She made her 15s test debut in May at scrumhalf.",
      "Keilamarita, four years older at 29, committed to Samoa early to try and qualify for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Her rugby road hasn\u2019t been as prominent as Risi\u2019s but she answered another call by Samoa in 15s and the outside center played the first two test matches of her career in this World Cup against Australia and England.",
      "After facing Australia in Manchester, Keilamarita made the two-hour drive to York the next day to watch Risi\u2019s own World Cup debut against Spain. Keilamarita celebrated the occasion by giving her little sister an ula lole \u2014 a Samoan necklace of candies \u2014 a Maori flag, and a big hug.",

      "\u201cElliann has been a real role model for me,\u201d Rhea told GH Media. \u201cTo share this journey with her has been incredible.\u201d",
      "Elliann, 24, debuted for Scotland in 2022 and went to that year's World Cup. But the tighthead prop's biggest step was going to Bristol the following summer. Training with England prop Sarah Bern, England training squad prop Simi Pam and Wales loosehead prop Gwenllian Pyrs elevated her game.",
      "After 12 tests off the bench, Elliann got her first start in her 13th against Fiji last September. Ever since she's made the No. 3 jersey hers, including in both World Cup wins against Wales \u2014 opposing Pyrs \u2014 and Fiji.",
      "Rhea, a scrumhalf, has been in Scotland camps for three years and finally made her test bow last March. Her second cap was last Saturday against Fiji. On Sunday she turned 22.",
      "Faitala was shocked when Manu'a phoned three weeks ago to say she'd been selected for the Wallaroos. Just a week after Faitala was named in the World Cup squad, injury ruled out Charlotte Caslick and Manu'a, uncapped and 18, was brought in.",
      "Manu'a told Faitala first. They're not just sisters but best friends who lift each other and ground each other. They've shared the same rugby path for years, starting with impromptu dad-supervised games with their brothers in a park near their old Penrith home.",
      "\u201cWhen someone cried we went home,\u201d Faitala said.",
      "They play for the ACT Brumbies, Faitala at flyhalf, Manu'a in the centers.",

      "\u201cIt's a different kind of responsibility now that I'm here and I am the older one and I do have more experience,\u201d Faitala told the Rugby Australia website. \u201cJust guiding her to be her own self and not to be my shadow is something that I truly strive to push her to be and, honestly, I think she's kind of taking more of the light now in training.\u201d",
      "What makes the head-shaking feat of two sets of sisters in one squad even more amazing is that they all come from the same club.",
      "Nant Conwy lies in a valley on the edge of Eryri National Park, Wales' mountain region in the north. The club was formed only in 1980. All four women started in mixed teams and moved into girls' sides at age 12.",
      "\u201c(The club) have always been so supportive of us, they've been a massive part of all four of our journeys,\u201d Nel said.",
      "Loosehead prop Gwenllian was the senior among them; she's appearing at her third World Cup at 27. Sister Alaw, a 19-year-old lock, joined her as a Wales international last September.",
      "Nel, a wing/fullback, was picked by Wales in 2023. She's 20, two years older than Branwen, who captained Wales in the Under-20 Six Nations this year. The back-rower received her first senior cap off the bench last Saturday against Canada.",
      "\u201cWords can't even describe how proud I am,\u201d Nel said. \u201cI've watched her work so hard, coming back from an ACL injury not too long ago. She fully deserves to be here.\u201d",
      "Fiji can also boast two sets of sisters, but not from the same club.",
      "Keleni Marawa and Karalaini Naisewa are props from Lautoka, while Setaita and Adi Salaseini \u2018Sala\u2019 Railumu are a scrumhalf and flanker from Suva's Seahawks.",
      "Naisewa came off the bench last weekend and burrowed under some Scots for Fijiana's third try in a loss in Manchester. Setaita Railumu started against Canada and Scotland. But her younger sister Sala and Marawa, who played at the 2022 World Cup, are waiting for their first World Cup appearances in England.",
      "\u201cIt has been a tough journey through the difficulties you face from home and the struggles during trainings,\u201d Marawa told Fiji Rugby, \u201cbut having my sister with me keeps me moving forward despite all the hardships.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The NBA said Wednesday that it will investigate if a $28 million endorsement contract between Kawhi Leonard and a California-based sustainability services company allowed the Los Angeles Clippers to circumvent league salary cap rules, following a report by journalist Pablo Torre.",
      "The probe will focus on ties between Leonard, the Clippers and a company called Aspiration Fund Adviser, LLC, which filed for bankruptcy this year. It listed several creditors at that time, among them the Clippers (who were owed about $30 million) and a company called KL2 Aspire LLC that was owed $7 million.",
      "Leonard is listed as the manager of that company in California filings. KL is his initials, and 2 is his jersey number. Emails sent to his listed representatives seeking comment Wednesday were not immediately returned.",
      "\u201cWe are aware of this morning\u2019s media report regarding the LA Clippers and are commencing an investigation,\u201d NBA spokesman Mike Bass said Wednesday.",
      "The Clippers denied that any league rules were broken. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer made a $50 million investment in Aspiration, and the company and the team announced a $300 million partnership in September 2021. That was about a month after Leonard signed a four-year, $176 million extension with the Clippers.",
      "\u201cNeither Mr. Ballmer nor the Clippers circumvented the salary cap or engaged in any misconduct related to Aspiration,\u201d the Clippers said in a statement released to several media outlets, including The Associated Press. \u201cAny contrary assertion is provably false: The team ended its relationship with Aspiration years ago, during the 2022-23 season, when Aspiration defaulted on its obligations.\u201d",
      "Aspiration\u2019s co-founder, Joseph Sanberg, agreed to plead guilty last month after facing federal charges of wire fraud. Prosecutors said he defrauded investors and lenders out of $248 million, adding that \u201cAspiration\u2019s financial statements were inaccurate and reflected much higher revenue than the company in fact received.\u201d",

      "There is no evidence that Leonard did anything to publicly endorse Aspiration.",

      "The league \u2014 which previously looked into claims that Leonard's representatives asked for certain things that would be considered cap circumventions when he was a free agent several years ago \u2014 can issue stiff penalties if cap rules are found to have been broken by a team, including a fine of up to $7.5 million, the voiding of contracts and the forfeiture of future draft picks.",

      "Suffice to say, it was a lot. With good reason.",
      "The catch \u2014 one where Daniels leaped at around the 4-yard line, snared the ball with his right hand and controlled it with his body while falling backward into the end zone \u2014 came in the final seconds of the first half, and proved to be a big part of the Hurricanes\u2019 27-24 win. The victory helped Miami climb five spots to No. 5 in this week\u2019s AP Top 25, going into a home game Saturday against Bethune-Cookman.",
      "\u201cThat was a game-deciding play,\u201d Miami quarterback Carson Beck said.",
      "It might have been the catch of the weekend in college football, though it wasn\u2019t the best that Beck has seen Daniels pull off during their short time together at Miami. Back in the spring, shortly after both transferred in and joined Miami \u2014 Beck came from Georgia, Daniels spent last season at LSU \u2014 the wideout went over three Hurricanes defenders for a one-handed grab that Beck is still talking about. And Beck didn't even throw that pass; he couldn't do any throwing this spring while recovering from elbow surgery.",
      "\u201cProbably the most ridiculous catch I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Beck said of the spring-ball one.",
      "That means the one Sunday night might be No. 2 on Beck\u2019s list. It came on a second-and-3 play from the Notre Dame 20. Beck was under pressure and was getting hit in the legs as he let the ball fly, throwing off his back foot, and Daniels found himself with a bit of space with defenders directly in front of him and behind him.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t take a lot of credit for that,\u201d offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson said of the catch. \u201cThe play was a play we were going to run in that situation. He ran a great route. Carson just got a little bit of pressure and kind of floated it up. The safety played over the top. Unbelievable catch. I mean, if you don\u2019t catch it, it might be a pick.\u201d",
      "That was a risk Beck was willing to take, given how much trust he\u2019s already built in Daniels\u2019 ability to simply go get any pass that\u2019s even remotely close to his hands.",

      "\u201cI won\u2019t say I was surprised. It was just the world was surprised,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cI know I\u2019m capable of making any play. When the ball is in the air, I just feel like it\u2019s really just me and the ball.\u201d",
      "That said, for as much as the Hurricanes are enjoying talking about the catch and all the buzz surrounding the play, Daniels is ready to move on.",

      "The Chinese-led research team based their findings on seismic readings from NASA\u2019s InSight lander on Mars, which recorded more than 1,300 marsquakes before shutting down in 2022. The spacecraft landed on a broad plain near Mars\u2019 equator in 2018.",

      "For their study, Sun and his team relied primarily on 23 marsquakes recorded by InSight, all of them relatively weak. The epicenters were 740 miles to 1,465 miles (1,200 kilometers to 2,360 kilometers) away from the lander.",

      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google\u2019s long-held position as the internet\u2019s main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by AI also reshaped the judge\u2019s approach to the remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and carried onward by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.",
      "The Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.",
      "In its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",
      "The Mountain View, California, company has already vowed to appeal the judge\u2019s monopoly findings issued 13 months ago that led to Tuesday's ruling.",

      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged more than 7% in extended trading. That would translate into a nearly $200 billion increase in Alphabet's market value, if the shares follow a similar trajectory in Wednesday's regular trading session.",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google\u2019s search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",
      "Apple's shares rose 3% in extended trading after the ruling came out.",
      "Mehta refrained from ordering a sale of Chrome because he decided there wasn't adequate proof the browser served as an essential ingredient in Google's search monopoly, making a divestiture \u201ca poor fit for this case.\u201d",
      "Chrome would have been a hot commodity had the judge forced Google to put it on the auction block. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Chrome last month. And during court testimony earlier this year, a ChatGPT executive left no doubt that service\u2019s owner, OpenAI, would be interested in be interested in buying Chrome, too.",
      "But the judge decided forcing Google to open up parts of its search data to rivals such as DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others will offer he best and fairest way to foster more compelling competition. In doing so, Mehta still narrowed the scope of the Justice Department's request and will limit the access to Google's search index and query histories.",
      "While the wrangling over Mehta's ruling continues, Google is facing another potentially debilitating threat in another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department targeting the digital ad empire that was built up around its search engine. After different federal judge in Virginia declared that some of the technology underlying the ad network to be an illegal monopoly earlier this year, the Justice Department plans to make its case for another proposed breakup  in a trial scheduled to begin later this month.",

    "story": [
      "Bulgarian authorities aren't investigating a suspected Russian interference operation involving a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen because they say the interference is now common",
      "LONDON -- Bulgaria will not investigate suspected Russian electronic interference with a top European official's plane, officials said Monday \u2014 because this kind of GPS jamming is now so common.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was flying to Plovdiv, Bulgaria on Sunday when her plane was hit by GPS jamming. It landed safely but the disruption was the latest in a string of almost 80 incidents tracked by The Associated Press and blamed on Russia by Western officials since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "This year, Nordic and Baltic nations \u2014 including Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2014 have repeatedly warned about greater electronic interference from Russia disrupting communications with planes, ships and drones.",
      "While Russian authorities suggest the jamming is defensive \u2014 to protect key cities and military infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks \u2014 Baltic officials say the depth of electronic interference has increased, causing navigation failures far from Russia's borders.",
      "In 2024, a plane carrying the British defense secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory, while a Finnish airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the interference experienced by von der Leyen's plane was part of a complex campaign by Russia against Europe which could have \u201cpotentially disastrous effects.\u201d",
      "Satellite communications systems \u2014 known collectively as the Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS \u2014 receive precise time signals from satellites around 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) away in space. A smartphone, car, marine or aircraft navigation system compares how long it takes to receive signals from several different satellites to calculate an exact location.",
      "But the signals can be interfered with \u2014 commonly known as jamming or spoofing.",
      "Jamming means a receiver is overwhelmed by a strong radio signal transmitted in the same range where GNSS and other satellite navigation signals operate, leaving the receiver unable to fix a location or time. Spoofing involves transmitting fake signals which imitate a real GNSS satellite signal \u2014 commonly known as GPS \u2014 to mislead a phone, ship or aircraft into thinking it is in a different place.",
      "In a military context, jamming could be used to stop an incoming missile or drone attack, whereas the idea behind spoofing is to \u201ccreate deception,\u201d said Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "It's possible that Israel used spoofing technology to fly into Iranian airspace in June, when it killed top generals and struck nuclear sites, Withington suggested. Spoofing, he said, could have helped Israel deceive Iranian radar.",
      "Long before the invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities deployed spoofing technology around the Kremlin in Moscow, causing chaos for taxi drivers or other motorists using GPS.",
      "Russia \u201cdoes not mind\u201d if its own infrastructure is affected, as long as enemy activity is deterred, said Withington.",
      "In August, Latvia\u2019s Electronic Communications Office said it had identified at least three hot spots for electronic interference along borders with Russia in the Kaliningrad, Leningrad and Pskov regions. All three regions host important Russian military bases.",
      "In April 2024, Finland's national carrier Finnair temporarily suspended flights to Tartu, Estonia after it said two of its planes were prevented from landing because of GPS disruptions. At that time, Tartu airport required approaching planes to use GPS to land, although planes have \u2014 and use \u2014 other forms of navigation.",
      "These include radio navigation and Inertial Navigation Systems, which determine where an aircraft \u2014 or submarine \u2014 is located by measuring its position in the air or water without relying on GPS.",

      "Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator, uses AI to produce songs across various genres",
      "LONDON -- When pop groups and rock bands practice or perform, they rely on their guitars, keyboards and drumsticks to make music. Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator who goes by the stage name imoliver, fires up his chatbot.",
      "McCann's songs span a range of genres, from indie-pop to electro-soul to country-rap. There\u2019s just one crucial difference between McCann and traditional musicians.",
      "\u201cI have no musical talent at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t sing, I can\u2019t play instruments, and I have no musical background at all.\"",
      "McCann, 37, who has a background as a visual designer, started experimenting with AI to see if it could boost his creativity and \"bring some of my lyrics to life.\u201d Last month, he signed with independent record label Hallwood Media after one of his tracks racked up 3 million streams, in what's billed as the first time a music label has inked a contract with an AI music creator.",
      "McCann is an example of how ChatGPT-style AI song generation tools like Suno and Udio have spawned a wave of synthetic music. A movement most notably highlighted by a fictitious group, Velvet Sundown, that went viral even though all its songs, lyrics and album art were created by AI.",
      "It fueled debate about AI's role in music while raising fears about \"AI slop\" \u2014 automatically generated low quality mass produced content. It also cast a spotlight on AI song generators that are democratizing song making but threaten to disrupt the music industry.",
      "Experts say generative AI is set to transform the music world. However, there are scant details, so far, on how it's impacting the $29.6 billion global recorded music market, which includes about $20 billion from streaming.",
      "The most reliable figures come from music streaming service Deezer, which estimates that 18% of songs uploaded to its platform every day are purely AI generated, though they only account for a tiny amount of total streams, hinting that few people are actually listening. Other, bigger streaming platforms like Spotify haven't released any figures on AI music.",
      "Udio declined to comment on how many users it has and how many songs it has generated. Suno did not respond to a request for comment. Both have free basic levels as well as pro and premium tiers that come with access to more advanced AI models.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total boom. It\u2019s a tsunami,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of Ohio University's School of Media Arts and Studies. The amount of AI generated music \u201cis just going to only exponentially increase\u201d as young people grow up with AI and become more comfortable with it, he said.",
      "Yet generative AI, with its ability to spit out seemingly unique content, has divided the music world, with musicians and industry groups complaining that recorded works are being exploited to train AI models that power song generation tools.",
      "Record labels are trying to fend off the threat that AI music startups pose to their revenue streams even as they hope to tap into it for new earnings, while recording artists worry that it will devalue their creativity.",
      "Three major record companies, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records, filed lawsuits last year against Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. In June, the two sides also reportedly entered negotiations that could go beyond settling the lawsuits and set rules for how artists are paid when AI is used to remix their songs.",
      "GEMA, a German royalty collection society, has sued Suno, accusing it of generating music similar to songs like \u201cMambo No. 5\u201d by Lou Bega and \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville.",
      "More than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn, released a silent album to protest proposed changes to U.K. laws on AI they fear would erode their creative control. Meanwhile, other artists, such as will.i.am, Timbaland and Imogen Heap, have embraced the technology.",
      "Some users say the debate is just a rehash of old arguments about once-new technology that eventually became widely used, such as AutoTune, drum machines and synthesizers.",

      "People complain \u201cthat you\u2019re using a computer to do all the work for you. I don\u2019t see it that way. I see it as any other tool that we have,\u201d said Scott Smith, whose AI band, Pulse Empire, was inspired by 1980s British synthesizer-driven groups like New Order and Depeche Mode.",
      "Smith, 56 and a semi-retired former U.S. Navy public affairs officer in Portland, Oregon, said \u201cmusic producers have lots of tools in their arsenal\u201d to enhance recordings that listeners aren't aware of.",
      "Like McCann, Smith never mastered a musical instrument. Both say they put lots of time and effort into crafting their music.",
      "Once Smith gets inspiration, it takes him just 10 minutes to write the lyrics. But then he'll spend as much as eight to nine hours generating different versions until the song \u201cmatches my vision.\u201d",
      "McCann said he'll often create up to 100 different versions of a song by prompting and re-prompting the AI system before he\u2019s satisfied.",
      "AI song generators can churn out lyrics as well as music, but many experienced users prefer to write their own words.",
      "\u201cAI lyrics tend to come out quite cliche and quite boring,\u201d McCann said.",
      "Lukas Rams, a Philadelphia-area resident who makes songs for his AI band Sleeping With Wolves, said AI lyrics tend to be \u201cextra corny\u201d and not as creative as a human, but can help get the writing process started.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll do very basic rhyme schemes, and it\u2019ll keep repeating the same structure,\u201d said Rams, who writes his own words, sometimes while putting his kids to bed and waiting for them to fall asleep. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll get words in there that are very telling of AI-generated lyrics, like \u2018neon,\u2019 anything with \u2018shadows\u2019.\u201d",
      "Rams used to play drums in high school bands and collaborated with his brother on their own songs, but work and family life started taking up more of his time.",
      "Then he discovered AI, which he used to create three albums for Sleeping With Wolves. He's been taking it seriously, making a CD jewel case with album art. He plans to post his songs, which combine metalcore and EDM, more widely online.",
      "\u201cI do want to start putting this up on YouTube or socials or distribution or whatever, just to have it out there,\u201d Rams said. \u201cI might as well, otherwise I\u2019m literally the only person that hears this stuff.\u201d",
      "Experts say AI's potential to let anyone come up with a hit song is poised to shake up the music industry's production pipeline.",
      "\"Just think about what it used to cost to make a hit or make something that breaks,\" Antonuccio said. \"And that just keeps winnowing down from a major studio to a laptop to a bedroom. And now it\u2019s like a text prompt \u2014 several text prompts.\u201d",
      "But he added that AI music is still in a \u201cWild West\u201d phase because of the lack of legal clarity over copyright. He compared it to the legal battles more than two decades ago over file-sharing sites like Napster that heralded the transition from CDs to digital media and eventually paved the way for today's music streaming services.",
      "Creators hope AI, too, will eventually become a part of the mainstream music world.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re entering a world where anyone, anywhere could make the next big hit,\u201d said McCann. \u201cAs AI becomes more widely accepted among people as a musical art form, I think it opens up the possibility for AI music to be featured in charts.\u201d",

      "Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.",
      "Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.",
      "Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.",
      "The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty major change,\u201d said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 state fiscal policy team, noting \u201cthe challenge in enacting something that\u2019s dramatically different for most drivers.\u201d",
      "Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.",

      "Gray wolves were hunted nearly to extinction throughout the U.S. West by the first half of the 20th century. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they've proliferated to the point that a population in the Northern Rockies has been removed from the endangered species list.",
      "There are now hundreds of wolves in Washington and Oregon, dozens more in northern California, and thousands roaming near the Great Lakes.",
      "The recovering population has meant increasing conflict with ranchers \u2014 and increasingly creative efforts by the latter to protect livestock. They've turned to electrified fencing, wolf alarms, guard dogs, horseback patrols, trapping and relocating, and now drones. In some areas where nonlethal efforts have failed, officials routinely approve killing wolves, including last week in Washington state.",
      "Gray wolves killed some 800 domesticated animals across 10 states in 2022, a previous Associated Press review of data from state and federal agencies found.",
      "Scientists with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed the techniques for hazing wolves by drone while monitoring them using thermal imaging cameras at night, when the predators are most active. A preliminary study released in 2022 demonstrated that adding human voices through a loudspeaker rigged onto a drone can freak them out.",

      "This is, however, about an affront to our democracy, an affront to what makes so many of us proud to be Americans, that we choose our own leaders, not that they get to pick themselves, not that they get to be picked by the president of the United States, the same president who detained a 6-year-old girl from a New York City public school system and took her hundreds of miles away, the same president that cut SNAP benefits from the hungry across these five boroughs \u2026 the same president who will throw millions of New Yorkers off their health insurance, is now seeking to undermine the very fabric of this city.\"",

      "The war is raging unabated, with no ceasefire in sight \u2014 and the crucial question of American involvement in ensuring Ukraine\u2019s future security remains unresolved.",
      "For months, the so-called \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d has been meeting to discuss aid for Ukraine, including sketching out plans for military support in the event of a ceasefire to deter future Russian aggression.",
      "The coalition leaders \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K Prime Minister Keir Starmer \u2014 have insisted that any European \u201creassurance\u201d force in Ukraine needs the backing of the United States. But while U.S. President Donald Trump has hinted his country will be involved, he has moved away from calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine and refrained from implementing tough additional economic measures to punish Moscow.",
      "Although Trump said he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Russian President Vladimir Putin and issued several threats to try to cajole him into negotiating an end to hostilities, none has worked. At a meeting with Putin in Alaska in August, Trump failed to persuade the Russian leader to stop fighting and has not yet managed to broker talks between Putin and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "While Trump and European leaders met in Washington after the Alaska summit \u2014 and U.S., European and NATO military chiefs held discussions on support for Ukraine \u2014 little concrete detail has emerged on the security guarantees to deter Moscow from a future conflict.",
      "Former military generals and experts suggest Europe is in a bind \u2014 not knowing the level of support the U.S. is prepared to provide the coalition, the nature of any ceasefire or if the U.S. will abide by commitments made. It's also far from certain that Putin would agree to a cessation of hostilities, something Russian officials have invariably dismissed.",
      "\u201cTalking about detailed operational planning when you don\u2019t actually have your mission is, quite frankly, impossible,\u201d said Ed Arnold, an expert in European Security at the Royal United Services Institute in London and a former military planner.",
      "The \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d is a broad term for about 30 nations supporting Ukraine, but the so-called \u201creassurance force\u201d that would provide security guarantees to Kyiv is a subset of that group.",
      "The U.K., France and Estonia have all suggested they are ready to deploy troops to Ukraine to deter Putin from attacking again, while officials in Poland said Warsaw will not take part and will instead focus on bolstering NATO security in the east of Europe.",
      "There is \u201cno suggestion\u201d that any troops will be deployed without a ceasefire because it's too risky, said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, special adviser at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris.",
      "Despite Zelenskyy signaling his willingness to talk, a ceasefire agreement is not currently in the cards \u2014 not least because of the positions of the U.S. and Russian presidents.",
      "At his Aug. 18 meeting with European leaders at the White House \u2014 a day after meeting Putin \u2014 Trump walked back his previous demands for a ceasefire in Ukraine and said he thought a peace agreement was preferable.",
      "The comments marked a shift toward the Russian position from Trump and would allow Moscow to fight on in Ukraine while peace negotiations are underway.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov later suggested an end to hostilities was even further away, stating that Moscow will not accept Zelenskyy's signature on any peace agreement as Russia considers him to be an illegitimate president.",

      "As a coalition leader, the U.K. should look at contributing a brigade of 5,000 soldiers which would become 15,000 when taking into account rest and rotation, said Arnold.",
      "That figure would account for about 30% of the deployable capacity of the British Army, he said, and potentially create a \u201ctricky\u201d problem whereby the U.K. deploys more forces on behalf of non-NATO ally Ukraine than it does for NATO allies such as Estonia.",

      "That means European nations cannot rely on him ordering U.S. jets into action in the event of a ceasefire violation because \u201cat one time he may say yes, at another time he may say no,\u201d Arnold said.",
      "With NATO membership for Kyiv ruled out by Trump and a host of hurdles to overcome to implement security guarantees for Ukraine, European leaders may decide to navigate the situation by spending \u201ca lot more money on weapons\u201d for Kyiv, said Heisbourg.",

      "WASHINGTON -- An unusual alliance emerged in the House on Wednesday as lawmakers who agree on little else rallied support for a bill that would prohibit members of Congress and their families from owning and trading individual stocks.",
      "The group included darlings of the far right, the left, moderates and many in between. They gathered to promote a ban that polls well with voters and appears to be finding new momentum after stalling out in previous sessions of Congress.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not every day you see this cast of characters up here,\u201d said Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican who represents a perennial swing district in Pennsylvania. \"You\u2019re all smirking out there. That\u2019s a good thing. It speaks to the power of this cause.\u201d",

Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents \u2014 while notably exempting Republican President Donald Trump. The House bill unveiled this week is limited to Congress, but the sponsors said they were open to extending it to the executive branch if enough support emerged.",
      "Under current law, federal lawmakers are required to disclose their stock sales and purchases. The bill requiring disclosure, The Stock Act, was signed into law in 2012. At the time, lawmakers and government watchdogs predicted that public disclosure would shame lawmakers out of actively buying and selling stock. That hasn\u2019t happened.",
      "The sponsors said they merged their own, individual bills on banning stocks and came together with a single bipartisan effort. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, the bill's lead sponsor, said that the group had been meeting for the last several months, and some sponsors had actually been working on this for years. About a dozen lawmakers from both parties joined Roy on stage. It was an unusually festive moment as the partisan lines in Congress have rarely been sharper.",

      "Currently, there are only seven Federal Railroad Administration employees trained to assess bridges, although their primary responsibility is to review each railroad's inspection plan to make sure they have a good plan in place and that won't change.

      "He needed three match points to end it, and was leaning over, hands on knees, after the first two resulted in long rallies that went Fritz's way. But on the last, the contest ended anticlimactically with a double-fault by No. 4-seeded Fritz, whose exit means the U.S. drought will continue without a male singles champion at any major since 2003, when Andy Roddick won in New York.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s one of the things that makes the great players great,\u201d Fritz said about Djokovic. \u201cThey win the big points.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Djokovic will play in his fourth Slam semifinal of the season and take on five-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz, who hasn't dropped a set in the tournament. He was a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 winner against No. 20 Jiri Lehecka earlier Tuesday.",
      "Djokovic leads No. 2 seed Alcaraz 5-3 head-to-head, winning their two most recent matchups \u2014 in the Australian Open quarterfinals this January and in the final at the Paris Olympics last year, when the Serbian finally fulfilled his wish to win a gold medal for his country.",
      "The last two men\u2019s quarterfinals are Wednesday: Alex de Minaur vs. Felix Auger-Aliassime, and defending champion Jannik Sinner vs. Lorenzo Musetti in an all-Italian matchup at night.",
      "On Tuesday night, both men were dressed entirely in black \u2014 shirts, shorts, socks and shoes. Even Djokovic\u2019s wrist bands were black, as was Fritz\u2019s headband, which he had on wrong at the start, so the white lettering of his clothing sponsor\u2019s name was upside-down until he made a change after the second set.",
      "If the players\u2019 get-ups looked alike, that\u2019s where the similarities stopped. Djokovic, who has won four of his 24 major championships at the U.S. Open, most recently in 2023, did what he usually does to Fritz \u2014 and, to be fair, nearly everyone else \u2014 which is to say: return masterfully, control the longest points and serve to all the right spots, particularly in the clutch.",
      "In sum, the 38-year-old Djokovic was generally a step, and a thought, or two ahead of the 27-year-old Fritz, whose serve got better over the last two sets.",
      "Djokovic won 25 of the 42 points that lasted at least nine strokes. He saved 11 of the 13 break chances he faced. And he won 10 of the 11 points when he serve-and-volleyed.",

      "A federal court hearing getting underway in Texas could be the final chance for families of some Boeing 737 Max crash victims to demand criminal prosecution of the company",
      "FORT WORTH, Texas -- Families of some of the 346 people killed in crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners held photos of their dead loved ones Wednesday outside a federal court in Texas, where a judge was hearing arguments on the U.S. government's motion to dismiss a felony conspiracy charge against the aerospace company in connection with the twin disasters.",
      "U.S. District Chief Judge Reed O\u2019Connor set aside time for relatives of the crash victims to speak during the hearing. Some traveled from countries in Europe and Africa to pursue what could be their final opportunity to demand that the company face criminal prosecution for the crashes off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia.",
      "\u201cMy daughter died on a new airplane that was defective and that was in operation because they weren\u2019t complying with regulations and because of fraud,\u201d said Nadia Milleron, a Massachusetts resident whose 24-year-old daughter, Samya Stumo, was among the 157 passengers and crew members killed in the Ethiopia crash. \u201cI don\u2019t want any other any other family member to lose their loved ones because of this kind of fraud.\u201d",
      "In charging Boeing with conspiracy to defraud the government, prosecutors alleged Boeing deceived Federal Aviation Administration regulators about a flight-control system that was later implicated in the fatal flights, which happened less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019.",
      "The hearing in Fort Worth comes more than four years after the Justice Department announced it had charged Boeing and reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the aircraft maker. That deal would have protected Boeing from criminal prosecution if it strengthened its ethics and legal compliance programs. But prosecutors revived the charge last year after deciding the company had violated certain terms of the agreement.",
      "Boeing decided to plead guilty to avoid a trial, but O\u2019Connor rejected that deal in December. The judge, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, cited concerns he had over how diversity policies both at the federal government and at Boeing could influence the selection of an independent monitor charged with overseeing the company's promised reforms.",
      "The judge\u2019s refusal to accept the plea agreement meant the company was free to challenge the Justice Department\u2019s rationale for charging Boeing as a corporation. It also meant prosecutors would have to secure a new deal for a guilty plea, and they spent six months renegotiating with Boeing.",
      "In late May, the two sides struck a deal that took both the criminal charge and Boeing's guilty plea off the table. In exchange, Boeing said it would pay or invest another $1.1 billion in fines, compensation for the crash victims\u2019 families, and internal safety and quality measures.",
      "The Justice Department said it offered those terms in light of \u201csignificant changes\u201d Boeing has made to its quality control and anti-fraud programs since last summer. It said the certainty of the agreement also served the public interest more effectively than taking the long-running case to trial and risking a jury verdict that might spare the company further punishment.",
      "Chris and Clariss Moore of Toronto, whose 24-year-old daughter, Danielle, also died when a 737 Max crashed shortly after takeoff from Ethiopia\u2019s Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, said in a statement that the pending agreement would allow Boeing to escape justice.",
      "\u201cThe safety of passengers will be held in the balance,\u201d the statement said.",

The Justice Department has asked the judge to leave open the possibility of refiling the conspiracy charge if the company does not hold up its end of the deal over the next two years.",
      "While federal judges typically defer to the discretion of prosecutors in such situations, court approval is not automatic.",
      "The yearslong case centers around a software system that Boeing developed for the 737 Max, which began flying in 2017.",
      "In the 2018 and 2019 crashes, that software pitched the nose of the plane down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor, and pilots flying for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines were unable to regain control. After the Ethiopia crash, the planes were grounded worldwide for 20 months.",
      "Investigators found that Boeing did not inform key Federal Aviation Administration personnel about changes it had made to the software before regulators set pilot training requirements for the Max and certified the airliner for flight.",
      "Acting on the incomplete information, prosecutors said, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737 pilots, avoiding the need for flight simulators that would have made it more expensive for airlines to adopt the latest version of the jetliner.",

      "The government had tied the freezes at Harvard to delays in dealing with antisemitism on its campus, but the judge said the federally funded research had little connection to antisemitism. \u201cA review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country\u2019s premier universities,\u201d Burroughs wrote.",
      "The ruling reverses a series of funding freezes that later became outright cuts as the Trump administration escalated its fight with the nation\u2019s wealthiest university.

      "Beyond the courthouse, the Trump administration and Harvard officials have been discussing a potential agreement that would end investigations and allow the university to regain access to federal funding. President Donald Trump has said he wants Harvard to pay no less than $500 million, but no deal has materialized, even as the administration has struck agreements with Columbia and Brown.",
      "Harvard\u2019s lawsuit accused the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university after it rejected a series of demands in an April 11 letter from a federal antisemitism task force.",

Likely to heighten their concerns is the expanded military footprint. The U.S. has deployed warships to the Caribbean and elsewhere off Latin America, culminating in what the administration said Tuesday was a lethal strike on an alleged Tren de Aragua gang vessel that U.S. officials say was carrying narcotics.",
      "\u201cPlease let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!\u201d Trump said of the strike, which he said had killed 11 gang members.",
      "Rubio, defending the strike, made clear that such operations would continue if needed. Though it was a military strike, America's top diplomat tweeted about it around when Trump announced it in the White House and then spoke to reporters about the operation.",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear that he\u2019s going to use the full power of America and the full might of the United States to take on and eradicate these drug cartels, no matter where they\u2019re operating from and no matter how long they\u2019ve been able to act with impunity,\u201d Rubio said Tuesday. \u201cThose days are over.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Disney will pay $10 million to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission that the entertainment company facilitated the \"unlawful collection\" of children's personal data.",
      "In a complaint filed on Tuesday, the FTC\u00a0said that Disney Worldwide Services and Disney Entertainment Operations \u2014 two entities that offer technical support and media content \u2014 violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, known as COPPA, by failing to properly label some videos uploaded to YouTube as \"made for kids.\" The mislabeling also exposed children to \"age-inappropriate YouTube features,\" the FTC said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "\"Our order penalizes Disney's abuse of parents' trust, and, through a mandated video-review program, makes room for the future of protecting kids online \u2014 age assurance technology,\" FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said in a statement.",
      "Signed into law in\u00a01998, COPPA requires commercial website operators to disclose to parents of children under 13 that they are collecting personal data and obtain the parents' prior consent.",
      "The videos in question included content from Disney movies including \"Coco,\" \"Frozen\" and \"Toy Story\" and as well as music from \"The Incredibles.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Disney told CBS News that the settlement does not involved Disney-owned and operated digital platforms and that it is limited to some of the content on the company's YouTube platform.",
      "\"Disney has a long tradition of embracing the highest standards of compliance with children's privacy laws, and we remain committed to investing in the tools needed to continue being a leader in this space,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "YouTube requires videos to be labeled as \"made for kids\" if children are the video's primary audience or if the content reflects \"an intent to target children,\" according to the Alphabet-owned platform. YouTube also says on its website that failure to properly label videos could lead to \"legal consequences under COPPA and other laws.\"",
      "YouTube began requiring video uploaders to add the \"made for kids\" label after it reached a similar settlement in 2019 with the FTC over COPPA violations.",
      "Disney's agreement with the FTC also calls for the company to create a program to review whether videos posted to YouTube should be designated as made for children the agency said.",

      "The series, which Rae and her collaborators started creating in 2019, features media icons such as Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Tracee Ellis Ross, Norman Lear and Shonda Rhimes.",
      "\"What inspired me to even get my start was just seeing the people that I love, the people that I know, the people that raised me on TV, and that representation was so essential for me to recognize that I could do it,\" Rae told \"CBS Mornings\" Tuesday about her inspiration growing up in the 90s.",
      "In the early 2000s, Rae said there was a \"disappearance all of the sudden\" of Black characters and shows on TV, but they reemerged about a decade later.",
      "In the 2010s, \"there were just so many new shows, new shows of color,\" she said. But now, Rae said TV and media is once again in an era where Black characters and shows have disappeared.",
      "\"I think the advent of cable made a huge difference where, you know, now these networks had to try to capture the broadest audience possible because they were losing audiences to different niche cable networks and so they were like, 'how can we maximize the audience we have?' and they have a tendency to go broad then, and broad sometimes just means White, the most eyeballs that you can get,\" she said.",
      "Even though shows like \"Family Matters\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" were universal and watched by a broad audience, there is sometimes a feeling that Black shows may exclude an audience, she said.",
      "The documentary also explores the importance of representation behind the camera.",
      "\"It makes such a difference when you're thinking about something as small as set design. I've seen that just even on my own productions and watching movies. Sometimes you'll watch a movie and you'll see a Black character's bedroom, and you'll be like 'they would never, what? They would never have that.'\"",
      "The details in a show could also apply to how a character dresses or their hair.",
      "\"I don't want to be taken out of a story. If I'm immersed, like those small details really, really matter, and there's just \u2014 also there's a different level of honestly, pride that goes in, in creating something that you know you're a part of and you understand on a different level,\" Rae said.",
      "She said the changing media industry is challenging, \"but it's another time that I'm confident we'll get through.

    "summary": "North Carolina was pummeled by TCU, 48-14, in the college coaching debut of NFL coaching legend Bill Belichick.",
    "story": [
      "Chapel Hill, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina's high-point moment in its first game under coach Bill Belichick came early.",
      "A festive pregame atmosphere led to a roar from the crowd at kickoff. And a season-opening drive moved at a crisp pace to the end zone.",
      "After that, well, Monday night's hyped-up debut turned into a romp by TCU - along with a reminder that even an NFL icon with six Super Bowl titles as a head coach can't just magically turn the Tar Heels into winners after decades of also-ran status.",
      "\"We played competitively but then just couldn't sustain it,\" Belichick said in the familiar low tone from his NFL news conferences after the 48-14 loss. \"Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. We need to do a better job all the way around \u2014 coaching, playing, all three phases of the game.\"",
      "CBSSports.com's Shehan Jeyarajah points out\u00a0that, \"The NFL is generally a defensive league where teams are close to evenly matched. At the college level, Belichick will come to understand just how big the talent differentials are between the good and bad teams \u2014 and he was on the wrong end.\"",
      "The blowout put a major damper on a night buzzing with optimism for the 73-year-old Belichick's college debut, only to see the Horned Frogs dominate so thoroughly they drove UNC fans to the Kenan Stadium exits by midway through the third quarter.",
      "\"It was a great environment tonight,\" Belichick said. \"I mean, the fans were awesome. There was great energy in the stadium. We just didn't do enough to keep it going. We've got to play better for the energy to be sustainable.\"",
      "By the end of the game, Kenan was a ghost town and the Tar Heels had given up more points than in any previous opener in their history, according to Sportradar.",
      "It was a jarring result, even amid uncertainty as to exactly what to expect from UNC with roughly 70 new players between transfers and incoming recruits. There were few highlights after that opening drive beyond Kaleb Cost's athletic reeling in of a deflected ball for an interception and quarterback Max Johnson returning in relief from a serious leg injury sustained in last year's opener at Minnesota.",
      "\"We're just moving forward, just moving forward,\" said Cost, offering an unintentional callback to Belichick's famous \"We're on to Cincinnati\" response to reporters' questions after a blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014.",
      "UNC was picked to finish eighth in the 17-team Atlantic Coast Conference, though that seemed almost entirely predicated on Belichick's mere presence. This is a man, after all, who teamed with legendary quarterback Tom Brady to win six world titles in his 24-year run with the New England Patriots. Someone who won more regular-season and playoff games in the NFL (333) than anyone other than Don Shula.",
      "So there was spectacle to Belichick's debut as he took the field sporting a familiar look from the pro sideline with a gray hoodie - only this one bearing the name \"Carolina Football\" in that distinctive shade of light blue.",
      "An estimated 5,000 fans packed onto a main campus quad for a pregame concert and throngs lined the team's walk to Kenan, where UNC has sold out all its season tickets \u2014 at an elevated price with Belichick's arrival \u2014 and single-game seats for the season. The game attracted ESPN to hold a pregame studio show from the sideline with a crew that included former Alabama coach Nick Saban, with Belichick popping over briefly to say hello.",
      "There were notable former UNC athletes from years past, including NBA legend Michael Jordan \u2014 who won a national championship under Dean Smith here in 1982 \u2014 and former UNC star linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who played under Belichick when he was an assistant and eventually defensive coordinator with the New York Giants during the 1980s.",
      "And it wasn't hard to spot Jordon Hudson \u2014 Belichick's 24-year-old girlfriend who has generated her own tabloid-level curiosity \u2014 as she walked the pregame sideline sporting Carolina blue pants shimmering with sequins-like additions on the legs.",
      "Belichick roamed the field during pregame warmups for the better part of a half-hour. At one point, he stood on the UNC end of the field with general manager Michael Lombardi, then shared a quick handshake with ACC commissioner Jim Phillips as he made his way toward midfield.",
      "Once there, Belichick shook hands with members of the officiating crew and watched the Horned Frogs warm up.",
      "The Tar Heels got off to a sprint of a start with an 83-yard drive that ended with Caleb Hood scoring through the right side from 8 yards out, followed by forcing a quick punt. But things soon started getting away.",
      "TCU \u2014 which lost in a similar scenario as the \"other\" team in Deion Sanders' debut at Colorado two years ago \u2014 never looked rattled or thrown. Bud Clark provided a highlight by jumping Gio Lopez's sideline throw for an easy 25-yard pick-six as TCU took a 20-7 lead into the break.",
      "It quickly got worse after halftime. Kevorian Barnes sprinted through the right side and down the sideline for a 75-yard touchdown on the first snap. Trent Battle added his own big run, slipping through the left side untouched and going 28 yards for a TD.",
      "And finally, Devean Deal had a 37-yard scoop-and-score on Lopez's fumble to make it 41-7 and start the Kenan exodus.",
      "By the end, UNC had just 222 total yards, 320 fewer than TCU, and a short week to fix problems before visiting Charlotte on Saturday.",
      "\"They were clearly the better team tonight,\" Belichick said. \"They deserved to win and they did it decisively.\"",

    "summary": "One of the founding members of Creedence Clearwater Revival lost control of his own songs when the band broke up in the early 1970s. Now, after buying back rights to his Creedence catalog, John Fogerty has come back to his music, recording the album \"Legacy.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It was life and death,\" said musician John Fogerty. \"I used to tell myself that phrase: 'This is life and death.' You're against the whole world.\"",
      "He felt that as a young man: \"Yes, oh yes. I mean, there's a million records out there. It's me against everybody that's every recorded and ever will record. You've got to do a great job. It was either be great, or go home!\"",
      "You know how it turned out for Fogerty. \"Great\" is something of an understatement. That voice \u2026 that guitar \u2026 and those songs, so many of which became hits that are now classics. But Fogerty, who recently turned 80, says every time he steps up to the mic, he still has something to prove \u2013 and still feel a little nerve. \"Oh yeah, yeah, every time!\" he laughed. \"But I think the nerves is what gives you the edge.",
      "I asked, \"How do you do that? What's the magic there?\"",
      "\"I wish I had a really great, contrived answer for you, but I don't!\" he laughed.",
      "The answer seems quite simple when you watch Fogerty rehearse. There is love of craft, and love of family. (His sons, Shane and Tyler Fogerty, help lead his touring band.)",
      "The group that put Fogerty on the charts was Creedence Clearwater Revival, which got its start in the late 1950s. Though a native of Northern California, Fogerty soaked up the rhythms of the South, giving birth to his so-called \"swamp rock\" sound, which he honed in the mid-'60s.",
      "He recalled: \"I received my honorable discharge from the Army. And the first line I wrote was, 'Left a good job in the city, workin' for the man every night and day.' Well, of course that was the Army. I mean, it had just happened. But as I begin to strum, I started singing this phrase: 'Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.' And at that point I'm, Well, what is this song? What is this? And I went to this songbook that I had just started keeping, and on the very first page, the very first entry, I had written the words 'Proud Mary.'",
      "\"And I actually understood right then that I'd written a classic song, a really great, American song,\" he said. \"And a few moments later, 'Oh my God. What if I never get to do this again? What if this is the only one that ever happens, and I'm a one-hit wonder?'\"",
      "Turns out, Fogerty was anything but that. Yet, after the 1972 breakup of Creedence, his solo career became mired in legal battles. He was stunned to discover he no longer had control over the use of the songs he wrote \u2013 and a limited share of the profits.",
      "Fogerty has looked on as others have endured similar challenges, and pain. The most famous current example: Taylor Swift, who earlier this year purchased the rights to her compositions, and won back control of her music.",
      "I asked, \"If you could pull her aside, John, and give her a piece of advice about how to get over the pain of a fight over your own music, what would you tell her?\"",
      "\"Well, I don't think you get over that kind of fight,\" he replied. \"What happened to me is, I stopped touring, and I stopped singing my own songs. I don't recommend that move to anybody. You become invisible. You're just forgotten about. It's like you died.\"",
      "I asked Julie, his wife of 34 years, if she ever doubted that he would be able to pull himself out of that anger. \"I think it was more sadness than anger,\" she said. \"And all he ever wanted to do in life was make music. That was his love. That was his best friend. And having that taken away and turned so bad was really hard for me to understand.\"",
      "Fogerty gives Julie credit for turning his life around. And she encouraged him not only to buy back the rights to his Creedence catalog, but to re-record those songs with his sons.\u00a0 The result: a new album, \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version).\"",
      "Julie said, \"Having those songs and being able to put his fist in the air and go, 'I own those songs,' I couldn't think of a better gift than having him record these with friends and family.\"",
      "You can stream John Fogerty's album \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)\" by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "Since they were children, sons Shane and Tyler learned guitar from their father.\u00a0 The new album is a family affair, but it's also serious business. \"I have the feeling that somehow Julie knew, she knew that at some point, the life-and-death John would kick in and I would have to roll up my sleeves,\" Fogerty said. \"'Cause that's what happened. And literally, this was kind of when the record was done, I think she told me, she said she could see me going back in time. With each one of these tracks, especially when I was doing the lead vocal, I had to remember what I felt like when I sang it the first time.\"",
      "And what a time it has been. For John Fogerty, the highs and lows have landed him here: at peace with it all, and lucky enough to have his songs still playing.",
      "I asked, \"What's it like for you to hear your music everywhere, even now?\"",
      "\"I don't know the exact right words; I can almost not believe it actually happened, or that that was me,\" he said. \"It's a prideful thing. I think it makes you feel really happy that you are able to tune into the radio station that God delivers, you know, and receive a song like 'Proud Mary,' and write it down, and even take credit for it, right? And then have it go around the world like that? It's kind of too much to really be able to grab hold of.\"",

Using unfussy backgrounds and large areas of color, he emphasizes shapes and outlines, and paints massive pieces, often with his wife, Ada, as his subject. \"I did the figures on a flat ground,\" he said. \"I did the double portraits of Ada. I did the big heads before anyone. And that's really aggressive. And the big compositions. No one had done anything like it.\"",
      "Katz grew up in Queens, New York, and attended the Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture in Maine. He's been honing his technique ever since.",
      "In 1986, \"Sunday Morning\" documented his artistic process:",
      "These days, the art world has caught up to Alex Katz's talent. His paintings can sell for millions of dollars, and exhibitions around the world have highlighted his work, including a show in 2022 at New York's Guggenheim Museum.",
      "Now famed for his portraits, Katz is also highly-regarded for his landscapes, often inspired by the picturesque scenes near his summer studio in Maine. \"It's a long way from Queens,\" he said, \"but it is like Queens. It's all kinda small!\"",
      "Katz says painting the outdoors heightened his creativity: \"I thought I was connecting with outdoor painting, but actually I was connecting with myself,\" he said. \"The painting was no longer cerebral. It was coming from the inside.\"",
      "This summer, Katz turned 98, and after a lifetime painting, he's focused on the work of other artists. He gifted a collection of more than a hundred paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
      "\"As the art world has moved in different ways and fashions, Alex has always stayed true to his self,\" said museum director Mark Bessire. \"I see his love of artists taking chance and his love of artists emanating that sense of energy that he likes in a painting. He doesn't like a painting because it looks like his or it's figurative. He likes it 'cause it's got the energy, and it pops.\"",
      "The exhibit is called \"Painting Energy.\"",
      "Asked to describe the sensation of looking at some of those paintings, Katz replied, \"It's just like a pow! You get it right through the air. It's very quick. Sometimes you can get a whole show \u2013 as they open the elevator door, blink, and they shut it, you know what this painting's about.\"",
      "One painting that gave Katz that \"pow\" was Katherine Bradford's \"Shadows.\"",
      "Bradford said that when she learned Katz had bought one of her paintings, \"I just felt, 'Oh, wow! Maybe I am a little good!' And Alex Katz, he certainly is really good. Good eye, good person.\"",
      "Bradford didn't start painting until her 30s. Now she's 83, and her pieces typically sell for tens of thousands of dollars. \"Alex Katz is a leader in contemporary art,\" she said. \"But in the state of Maine, he's king. And we all look up to him. He decided to use what he had gained to give back to artists, to buy artists' work.\"",
      "Asked why he wanted to collect other artists' paintings, Katz said, \"Well, I wanted to help other people who went through the same difficulty that I did, you know? I know every little help I got in that period from 25-35, I really appreciated.\"",
      "Like when a paint manufacturer who recognized Katz's talent early on gave him art supplies as part of a deal: \"He got five or six little paintings, and I had free paints,\" said Katz. \"But the big thing was someone believed there was something in me.\"",
      "Katz still works seven days a week, and is still taking risks. \"Sometime, in about a week, I'll do the first painting of a new series,\" he said.",
      "\"And you seem excited about that?\" I asked.",
      "\"Excited and frightened,\" he laughed. \"Yeah, I'm scared it really won't work out.\"",
      "\"So, after all that you've accomplished, you still worry?\"",
      "\"Uh-huh. I want to go where I'm scared. And the new things might be better, they might be worse, but I have to do 'em.\"",

      "She chose September, that most excellent month, to make her move. The monsoon had receded, leaving Kerala gleaming like an emerald strip between the mountains and the sea. As the plane banked to land, and the earth rose to greet us, I couldn't believe that topography could cause such palpable, physical pain. I had never known that beloved landscape, never imagined it, never evoked it, without her being part of it. I couldn't think of those hills and trees, the green rivers, the shrinking, cemented-over rice fields with giant billboards rising out of them advertising awful wedding saris and even worse jewelry, without thinking of her. She was woven through it all, taller in my mind than any billboard, more perilous than any river in spate, more relentless than the rain, more present than the sea itself. How could this have happened? How? She checked out with no advance notice. Typically unpredictable.",
      "The church didn't want her. She didn't want the church. (There was savage history there, nothing to do with God.) So given her standing in our town, and given our town, we had to fashion a fitting funeral for her. The local papers reported her passing on their front pages, most national papers mentioned it, too. The internet lit up with an outpouring of love from generations of students who had studied in the school she founded, whose lives she had transformed, and from others who knew of the legendary legal battle she had waged and won for equal inheritance rights for Christian women in Kerala. The deluge of obituaries made it even more crucial that we do the right thing and send her on the way she deserved. But what was that right thing? Fortunately, on the day she died the school was closed and the children had gone home. The campus was ours. It was a huge relief. Perhaps she had planned that, too.",
      "Conversations about her death and its consequences for us, especially me, had begun when I was three years old. She was thirty then, debilitated by asthma, dead broke (her only asset was a bachelor's degree in education), and she had just walked out on her husband\u2014my father, I should say, although somehow that comes out sounding strange. She was almost eighty-nine when she died, so we had sixty years to discuss her imminent death and her latest will and testament, which, given her preoccupation with inheritance and wills, she rewrote almost every other week. The number of false alarms, close shaves, and great escapes that she racked up would have given Houdini pause for thought. They lulled us into a sort of catastrophe complacency. I truly believed she would outlive me. When she didn't, I was wrecked, heart-smashed. I am puzzled and more than a little ashamed by the intensity of my response.",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 current and former Health and Human Services employees penned an open letter Wednesday calling for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to either resign or be fired.",
      "The letter \u2014 whose signatories were not publicly named \u2014 was released at a tense time for the health agency. Last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired, and several other top CDC officials resigned from their jobs in protest. Staff are also reeling from layoffs, changes to the vaccine approval system \u2014 led by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 and a shooting outside the CDC headquarters last month.",
      "Wednesday's letter accused Kennedy of \"endangering the nation's health.\" It cited last week's upheaval at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to rescind emergency approvals that made the COVID-19 vaccines available for young children, and the elevation of \"political ideologues who pose as scientific experts\" to key vaccine approval posts.",
      "It called for Kennedy to resign, and said that if he declines to leave his post voluntarily, President Trump should pick a new HHS secretary.",
      "\"We swore an oath to support and defend the United States Constitution and to serve the American people. Our oath requires us to speak out when the Constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,\" the letter reads.",
      "The letter was released by a group called Save HHS, which penned a similar open letter last month urging Kennedy to \"stop spreading inaccurate health information.\"",
      "The group said the signatories for Wednesday's letter were provided to members of Congress, but weren't publicly listed due to security and privacy concerns.",
      "HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon responded to the letter by defending Kennedy's record and arguing he is working to restore trust in a \"broken\" CDC.",
      "\"From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door \u2014 and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\" Nixon said. \"That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Separately, nine former CDC directors wrote a New York Times op-ed on Monday that castigated Kennedy for making decisions they said were \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" and argued Monarez's firing \"adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday morning, where he's likely to face questions about the tumult at HHS.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed that Monarez was fired. Her lawyers called the firing \"legally deficient\" and said she was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",

      "In his new book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life\" (published September 2 by Simon & Schuster), Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon and chief medical correspondent for CNN, writes about chronic pain, and the innovative techniques now being used to study and treat it.",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Over a hundred years ago, William Osler, the Canadian physician and founding influence on modern medicine and medical education, is said to have instructed his students to \"listen to the patient. Quite often he is telling you the diagnosis.\"",
      "Today, the urgent search for meaningful insights into chronic pain has given that idea a new relevance, with impressive results. Health care providers now encourage patients to engage as partners in the treatment process. Research programs now routinely include people with lived experience\u2014patients, family members, caregivers\u2014as members of committees that advise and direct pain studies.",
      "Pain scientists are calling for a dramatic change that puts greater emphasis on the studies that draw first from people's real-life pain experience, then follows up with lab-based research to develop targeted solutions for effective pain management. This reverse translational research flips the classic bench-to-bedside process that starts in a laboratory and ends with a clinical trial.",
      "Reverse translational research begins with the patient's real-world experience and then tries to decipher the mechanisms through brain imaging and blood tests, correlated with the patient's symptoms and self-reports. Instead of the bench to the bedside, which was taught when I was in medical school, this is bedside to the bench research. The bench scientists then work with the findings to learn more about the basic mechanisms.",
      "Prasad Shirvalkar, a pain physician, neuroscientist, and the director of the Shirvalkar Lab at the University of California at San Francisco, used such a hybrid approach a couple of years ago to find the unicorn in pain science: objective biomarkers of a subjective experience. He started by implanting electrodes in the brains of patients, to measure brain signals. He then followed the trial participants home and, with the use of continuous surveys and digital monitoring, tracked their pain through everyday life and correlated those results with direct readings from the brain. The combination of lab-based and home-based monitoring led to a groundbreaking series of clinical trials that made headlines around the world. In 2023, his team was able to directly map signals of chronic pain for the first time in history. In more recent trials, the team used electrodes implanted in the brain to map the unique neural signature of each participant's pain experience over thousands of hours. The result was the ability, for the first time, to create an objective measure of an individual patient's subjective pain experiences.",
      "In a more recent and ongoing trial, the maps and electrodes were used to predict a pain burst, which was followed by the delivery of a carefully calibrated electrical impulse\u2014deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrupt the pain, reducing or even eliminating it altogether. Predicting when pain might occur, objectively measuring its severity, and then quickly inhibiting it is in many ways the ultimate achievement.",
      "Ed Mowery's story is about someone using this remarkable treatment approach, but first a caveat. It's not currently available, or even feasible, for general use, so it can't deliver on the dream of a cure for chronic pain. But it does deliver evidence that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and malleable. It can be targeted and treated, and we'll likely see the emergence of a range of approaches that can do so without brain surgery.",

    "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 09:56:57 -0400",
    "summary": "Jane Pauley talks with the author of \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt\" about the body's defenses against pain; and with Ed Mowery, whose decades-long experience with pain led to a revolutionary surgery and treatment.",
    "story": [
      "Ed Mowery, the founder and lead singer of a death metal band, suffered unfathomable pain for decades: \"It was 24/7, 365,\" he said, likening it to \"lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and nerve pain in my arms.",
      "\"Have you ever had a really bad burn when you're cooking? Imagine that really bad burn, multiply it by, say, 20 to 30, and then apply it from the neck down. And on top of that burn was the lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and the crazy nerve burn in my arms. So, it was several different kinds of pain at once.\"",
      "It's a rare condition affecting 200,000 people in the U.S., called complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS. But doctors could find no cause for it.",
      "\"There was nothing to point to and says, 'This is why it's hurting.' It was just a sort of unrelenting pain,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, best known as chief medical correspondent at CNN. A neurosurgeon and author, his latest book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt,\" explores the mystery of pain \u2013 mundane aches and pains, or excruciating pain like Mowery suffered.",
      "A lot of Americans are hurting; the CDC says approximately 20% are in pain. And while writing the book, Gupta found one of them was his mother \u2013 83-year-old Damyanti Gupta, who had a fall right outside her front door.",
      "\"I had osteoporosis,\" she said, \"and I think one of my bones must have given up, I think, because I didn't trip over anything.\"",
      "Imaging showed a compressed lumbar vertebra. But pain doesn't appear on X-rays and MRIs.\u00a0 \"You know how they ask you, doctors tell me, 'From a scale of one to 10, what is your pain?' I would've said 100,\" Damyanti said. \"You don't really realize 'til you have it. I never realized that pain can be that terrible. You don't want to even live anymore.\"",
      "\"I don't want to live anymore \u2013 coming from my mom, obviously it's really painful to hear,\" said Dr. Gupta. \"But also this was someone who'd never complained about anything. So, you had a sense of just how significant an impact this was on her.\"",
      "Spinal surgery successfully repaired the injured spine, and immediately Damyanti's pain went from 100 to about 3.",
      "The surprising source of pain",
      "As a brain surgeon, Gupta sees patients in pain every day, but he personally experienced serious pain when he was a kid who thought he could vault over a spiked fence. \"I don't know what I was thinking,\" he said. \"But I didn't make it. And this spike from the fence went right through the back of my skin on the side, and came right out the front. So, I was essentially pinned and impaled on top of this fence.\"",
      "As the shock wore off, the future doctor \u2013 still on the fence \u2013 took note: \"The pain started to come in waves. So it was there, felt like someone was sort of slapping my back, but then after a while it just didn't hurt that much anymore. And there was a couple of times when I had to reach back around and say, 'It's still there, right?' Even at the time, that struck me as a really surprising experience. Like, I had a hot poker thing going through my back, and yet I'm not feeling pain? Like, why would that be?\"",
      "Later, he learned the reason why. \"It took years to sort of understand this,\" he said. \"My body's endogenous opioid system \u2013 we have our own opioid system \u2013 it reacted, and it reacted in a big, big way. Because the body is just flooded with all these opioids and it improves my mood, it decreases my memory of the painful experience, and obviously it helps with the overall hurt.",
      "\"These are endorphins, and by the way, endorphins \u2013 endo, which means comes from your body, and phin, morphine\u2014so it's like your body's own natural morphine,\" he said.",
      "After years of suffering despite pain medication (including morphine), Ed Mowery joined a clinical trial at the University of California at San Francisco, which not only found the source of those \"lightning bolt razor snakes,\" but would make headlines around the world.",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "The source of the pain, said Gupta, was \"the brain. It's hard to conceptualize, I realize this. But Ed is sort of this daredevil guy. He had a lot of injuries over his life. He had had a knee operation, and it was after that knee operation that, for some reason, his brain had taken the experience of his knee surgery and started to memorize it, and got it a little bit wrong. So instead of saying, 'Hey, your knee hurts,' it just went into this hyper-drive. The best metaphor would be something known as 'phantom pain.' That's when someone loses a limb and then they still hurt, even though that limb doesn't even exist anymore. How can that happen? The brain. The brain is creating that pain. Why that's happening exactly, we're not sure.\"",
      "\"Shutting off\" the pain",
      "Mowery had volunteered for a study in deep brain stimulation and pain, and three rounds of brain surgery. \"I had nodes sticking out of my head,\" Mowery said. \"And I had 144 wires going to two computers. And I had a turban on my head. And I also had a lot more hair!\"",
      "Gupta said, \"After weeks they were able to draw this link between Ed's pain and these changes in the brain. And what they found with Ed was not only could they start to predict that Ed was gonna have pain, they could quantify how bad that pain was likely to be, and they could even interrupt the pain by giving a little stimulation. So even before the pain would get to conscious awareness, the stimulator would go off and it would start to interrupt that pain cycle.\"",
      "Gupta predicts Mowery's story is just the beginning: \"What these doctors were able to do, they were essentially able to put these probes all over the brain and just leave these probes in sort of to listen to Ed's brain.\"",
      "Even now, a computer can recognize his pain coming on \u2013 and shut it off.",
      "It's been life-changing for Mowery, who spoke about the clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health: \"The last two days of testing, the signal started working, and killing my pain,\" he said. \"I was beside myself.\"",
      "Though a small study, the implications for managing all sorts of pain are far-reaching. \u00a0As Gupta explains, the brain is the source of every sensation of pain, from a paper cut, to a broken vertebra, to \"razor snakes.\"",
      "I asked Mowery, \"Did you know when you signed up for this, what you were signing up for?\"",
      "\"It's funny you ask that question, because when I first found out, I said, 'There's no way. I'm not doing three brain surgeries. You're not going into my brain. No way,\" Mowery said. \"And then a year-and-a-half later, I was in so much pain, I just didn't care anymore.\"",
      "\"You seem very comfortable when you describe this as your brain,\" I said.",
      "\"It took me a while to wrap my brain around the fact that this is a brain disease,\" Mowery replied. \"It took a long time for me to just say, oh, you know, this is actually all in my head. But it wasn't imaginary. It was real.\"",
      "Today, Mowery is playing his music again, and looking forward to touring internationally with his band. \"I never lost hope,\" he said, \"because I knew something would come along to help me. And I think that's part of what got me through all this, was my attitude towards the whole thing.\"",

      "A new study released Friday found that young children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, are often prescribed medication too quickly.",
      "The study, led by Stanford Medicine and published in JAMA Network Open, examined the health records of nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children ages 3 to 5 between 2016 and 2023 who were diagnosed with ADHD.",
      "\"ADHD is a disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or what we call hyperactivity, which is sort of like kids that have a hard time sitting still, they have a lot of energy,\" explained Jamie Howard, a senior clinical psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, which specializes in treating anxiety and mood disorders in children.",
      "Howard, who was not involved in the study, said that when treating ADHD in young children, clinical guidelines call for starting with \"behavioral intervention.\"",
      "\"We always want to start with the lowest possible harm,\" Howard said. \"It does very little harm doing a behavioral intervention.\"",
      "The Stanford study found that about 68% of those children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed medications before age 7, most often stimulants such as Ritalin, which can help children focus their attention and regulate their emotions.",
      "The turn to medication often came quickly, according to the study. About 42% of the children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis, the study found.",
      "\"We don't have concerns about the toxicity of the medications for 4- and 5-year-olds, but we do know that there is a high likelihood of treatment failure, because many families decide the side effects outweigh the benefits,\" Dr. Yair Bannett, assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and the lead author of the study, said in a statement.",
      "Those side effects can include irritability, aggressiveness and emotional problems, according to Bannett.",
      "\"The high rate of medication prescriptions among preschool-age children with ADHD and the lack of delay between initial diagnosis and prescription require further investigation to assess the appropriateness of early medication treatment,\" the researchers concluded.",
      "The study also found that the vast majority of the young children diagnosed with ADHD, about 76%, were boys.",
      "\"I think that people have an association with ADHD and stimulant medication,\" Howard said. \"...But there is actually a lot more than that. And we want to give kids the opportunity to use these other strategies first, and then if they need medication, it can be incredibly helpful for a lot of kids.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to rein in spending this holiday season by the most amount since the pandemic, as they continue to face pressure from high prices and tariffs.",
      "That's according to a new survey released by accounting firm PwC on Wednesday, which predicts Americans this year will reduce holiday spending to $1,552 a person on average, which is 5% less than in 2024. That includes spending on gifts, travel, food and entertainment.",
      "If the predictions come to pass, it would represent the most significant drop in holiday spending since 2020. While consumers are not cutting purchases entirely, they are getting smarter about how they stretch their dollars, according to Alison Furman, PwC's consumer markets industry leader.",
      "\"Inflation is kind of creeping in, and they're seeing it affect their wallets,\" Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For its report, PwC surveyed 4,000 Americans from Gen Zs to baby boomers over a two-week period from June to July, when tariff-related uncertainty was more pronounced. But any perceived changes in the economy over the next couple of months could alter consumers' attitude toward spending.",
      "\"Economic signals continue to shift and, between now and December, purchasing behavior could evolve in response,\" the report states.",
      "The generation expected to tighten their spending the most is Gen Z. Respondents from this cohort, ages 17 to 28, said they expect to reduce their holiday budgets by 23% \u2014 more than any other generation in the study. That's due in part to the\u00a0tough job market\u00a0facing young Americans, along with rising costs.",
      "Overall, 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending in general over the next six months, according to the report.",
      "A slowdown in spending could spell trouble for retailers who depend on holiday sales to shore up revenue toward the end of the year.

      "Discretionary spending on categories like indoor and outdoor dining were down in August, according to the U.S. Conference Board's latest consumer confidence index each month. Meanwhile, average 12-month inflation expectations among consumers increased to 6.2%, from 5.7% in July.",

      "PwC expects consumers to approach holiday shopping \"more deliberately,\" with an eye toward saving money, amid ongoing concerns over tariffs and high prices.",

      "With deals in mind, consumers are expected to do a large portion, or 39%, of their total planned holiday gift spending, during the time between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the PwC report. With heightened traffic expected during that five-day stretch, Furman advises shoppers to start looking early for popular items.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/phantom-unplug-devices-save-energy-emissions-waste/",
    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:04:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Wasted energy is a hidden drain on household electricity but small steps can contribute significantly to lowering costs and emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\"Phantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they've improved over time,\" said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\"The good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\" said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\"Just take a little step of unplugging the things that you're not using,\" said Charron. \"It will save you money and it'll save emissions in the long run.\"",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\"Do you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you're not using it?\" said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",
      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you're not using that could be draining energy help, too. For example, smart televisions often have optional features that can be turned off so the television isn't listening for signals from other devices while in standby mode.",
      "\"If you're not using it, then you're getting no benefit, yet you're paying the price and increased the energy use,\" said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"The question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\" said Gilligan. \"Phantom power is one part of this.\"",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don't want to feel like they're being irresponsible.",
      "\"This is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\" said Giligan.",
      "When it comes to daily choices, individuals may think what they're doing isn't really making a big difference. But what they tend to overlook is how they influence others around them by choosing to live a more sustainable life.",
      "The impact may be much stronger than a lot of people realize, Gilligan said.",

      "The Seattle-based coffee chain said Tuesday that starting Sept. 29 it will add protein cold foams and protein lattes to its menu. The cold foam, which customers can order to top coffee, tea or Starbucks Refreshers, adds about 15 grams of protein to a grande drink. The lattes, made with \"protein-boosted milk,\" contain 27 to 36 grams of protein, according to Starbucks.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 19:34:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The judge rejected the Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding the request was a bridge too far.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google's search engine in a crackdown aimed at curbing the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \"answer engines\" as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google's long-held position as the internet's main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by generative artificial intelligence, or \"GenAI,\" have reshaped the judge's approach to remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case.",
      "\"Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge's forte,\" Mehta wrote.",
      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged nearly 3% in extended trading.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google's search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine's secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \"would be incredibly messy and highly risky.\"",
      "\"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\" Google said in a statement provided to CBS News following the ruling. \"We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case's focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.\"",
      "\"We proved in court that competition had been frozen in place for two decades in internet search,\" Abigail Slater, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, wrote in a social media post. \"Google's tactics have excluded competition, harming consumers and slowing innovation. Today's remedy order agreed with the need to restore competition to the long-monopolized search market, and we are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough in serving that goal.\"",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It's also something that Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and the beneficiaries of the payments urged Mehta to maintain.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google's search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",

      "Disney will pay $10 million to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission that the entertainment company facilitated the \"unlawful collection\" of children's personal data.",
      "In a complaint filed on Tuesday, the FTC\u00a0said that Disney Worldwide Services and Disney Entertainment Operations \u2014 two entities that offer technical support and media content \u2014 violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, known as COPPA, by failing to properly label some videos uploaded to YouTube as \"made for kids.\" The mislabeling also exposed children to \"age-inappropriate YouTube features,\" the FTC said in a\u00a0statement.",

      "A new cryptocurrency issued by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial\u00a0and that started trading this week has boosted the family's wealth on paper by roughly $5 billion despite the digital token sinking in its first two days of being listed on the exchange.",
      "The crypto, called WLFI, reached a high of about 40 cents after launching on Monday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. By Tuesday morning, the value of the token had fallen to as low as about 21 cents, down 48% from its peak, before recovering to about 23 cents in the afternoon.",
      "Even with the decline, the Trump family's stake in WLFI is worth about $5 billion based on its holdings of 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. Mr. Trump and his family aren't yet able to sell their holdings as its founders' tokens remained locked, according to World Liberty Financial.",
      "World Liberty Financial didn't immediately return a request for comment. Here's what to know about the company's token.",
      "Trump's support for crypto",
      "Once an avowed skeptic of cryptocurrency, Mr. Trump has championed the digital asset in his second term, vowing to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial and the Trump family's other private crypto ventures have raised concerns among some watchdog groups and Democratic lawmakers over potential conflicts of interest.",
      "\"The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "In July, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies, into law. The act established federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The surging value of World Liberty Financial, whose co-founders include Mr. Trump and his sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, underscores the president's growing interest in cryptocurrency, a focus that spans both personal investments and policy moves during his presidency. Those efforts include\u00a0$TRUMP and $Melania meme coins, which are cryptos whose value is linked to internet trends and which began trading in January.",
      "What is WLFI?",
      "WLFI is a token, or a digital asset, that guarantees its holders the right to vote on governance issues for World Liberty Financial, according to the company.",
      "World Liberty Financial cautions token owners that WLFI isn't an investment, with its terms stating: \"You should not acquire $WLFI as an investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, for a financial purpose or with an expectation of resale for a profit or otherwise.\"",
      "The early swing in WLFI's price isn't unusual for tokens making their market debut, said Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, a provider of crypto and blockchain information.",
      "\"The price action from 40 cents to 21 cents is typical for new token launches,\" Puckrin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Early hype usually drives initial spikes, followed by a wave of selling as early entrants take profits.\"",
      "He added, \"Compared to other major token debuts, WLFI's decline is relatively moderate, and early backers have still seen strong returns from private sales.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial also offers a stablecoin called USD1, which is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. Because stablecoins are linked to fixed assets, they are generally seen as less volatile to other cryptos.",
      "\"WLFI is carving out a unique position by offering token holders real governance rights over the direction of USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin that is growing rapidly,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That's important because WLFI holders, through their governance votes, can help influence the future development and policies of USD1 and World Liberty Financial's policies, he added. That capacity \"sets it apart in a crowded market,\" he said.",
      "What about insider concentration risk?",
      "The Trump family and other insiders own more than 20% of the WLFI tokens, according to World Liberty Financial's site.",
      "But World Liberty Financial's terms note that no single digital wallet can exercise more than 5% of governance power, which should deter outsized insider influence, Puckrin said.",
      "What's happening with Mr. Trump's other crypto ventures?",
      "In May, the $TRUMP meme coin drew scrutiny when the venture offered its top holders the chance to join Mr. Trump for dinner. Investors spent about $140 million to snap up the coins and secure an invite to the event, data showed at the time.",
      "That sparked concerns from government watchdogs and some Democratic lawmakers that the Trump-branded asset was being linked to gain access to the president.",
      "As investors snapped up the meme coin, the asset's value almost doubled to about $15 in May. Since then, the coin has given up most of the gains and was trading at about $8.30 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Trump Media & Technology Group \u2014 the owner of the Truth Social app \u2014 has expanded into crypto in recent months. In July, it bought about $2 billion in cryptocurrencies\u00a0to refashion the business as an investment firm.",

      "Wintour, who is widely considered to be the most powerful figure in the fashion industry,\u00a0announced in June she was taking a step back from her editorial duties. The 75-year-old has served as the magazine's editor-in-chief since 1988.",
      "Malle may be stepping into Wintour's low-heeled slingbacks, but she'll report to the original wearer while taking over day-to-day operations at the U.S. edition. In Vogue's online post, Wintour said she is excited to continue working with Malle as \"her mentor but also as her student.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 08:22:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Courts weigh fairness of reimbursement formula as Arkansas jury finds against State Farm.",
    "story": [
      "An Arkansas jury found recently that a major car insurance carrier had shortchanged customers who had been in accidents that left their cars \"totaled,\" and now plaintiffs in other states are pursuing similar cases.",
      "The Arkansas lead plaintiff, Rose Chadwick, said she initially assumed the reimbursement for her \"totaled\" 2011 Hyundai was reasonable compensation, \"because that's what I pay them for, is to be fair with me.\"",
      "But after learning about potential legal action challenging the way insurance carrier State Farm calculated the replacement cost, she decided to bring her case to court. Her lawyers alleged that the company used technology to estimate the amount of buying a replacement. That program factored into the calculation the potential for the car buyer to negotiate a discount from used car dealers \u2014 a haggling discount that Chadwick's attorneys argued was no longer consistent with how modern-day used cars are priced and sold.",
      "\"The computer program that State Farm used to calculate the replacement value of the car, did it systematically unfairly,\" said Chadwick's attorney, Brian Glasser. Glasser says his firm argued that commonly used software systematically low-balled the value of total-loss cars for tens of thousands of drivers across the country.",
      "In an Arkansas federal court in June, a jury agreed \u2014 finding in favor of Chadwick and 37,000 other plaintiffs. The jury determined Chadwick had been underpaid by about $600 for a car worth $4,700.",
      "State Farm is fighting lawsuits on the issue in multiple states, arguing that the system the company used at the time was standard for most automobile insurers. It no longer uses the same program to calculate reimbursement amounts.",
      "\"State Farm always seeks to pay what we owe within the terms of the policy to help our customers recover from a loss,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"We work with the policyholder to determine the actual cash value of a total loss vehicle considering the age, condition, equipment, mileage of the vehicle at the time of the loss,\" the company said, adding that customers are \"also invited to share additional information and has the option to use a third-party appraisal to help reach agreement on the value of their totaled vehicle.\"",
      "A \"totaled\" car is typically one that has sustained damage that would cost more to repair than the value of the car itself.",
      "Company officials noted that appellate courts in multiple jurisdictions have agreed with their contention that a challenge to the reimbursement process cannot be made en masse, in the form of a class action lawsuit, as it was in Arkansas. The courts have split over whether each reimbursement case is unique, and must be filed separately, or whether all customers whose loss was calculated the same way can file suit together as a class.",
      "Chadwick's case began five years ago, when her daughter borrowed her car for an early morning run to the store when she was struck from behind while going through an intersection.",
      "After learning of the reimbursement issue in a social media post, Chadwick became the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the insurance giant accusing it of undervaluing and shorting payouts on claims like hers.",
      "\"State Farm moves billions of dollars to people for their broken cars every year and, and insurance companies around America do similar numbers,\" Glasser said. \"So we're talking about these computer programs that calculate the value of your replacement vehicle that affect billions of dollars every year.\"",
      "Attorneys are launching similar cases against several insurance carriers in at least 19 states while regulators in some of those states weigh whether insurers must change how they value total loss cars.",
      "State Farm said customers are not without recourse if they have questions about the estimate the company provides to reimburse a customer whose car was a total loss. Among them, customers are encouraged to ask their insurer how they determined the payout amount, to an agreeable price, and to get an independent appraisal of what the car was worth.",
      "In the end, Chadwick said the dispute was less about the money than about principles.",
      "\"It was like hiding something and you shouldn't hide,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Kraft Heinz is splitting into two companies a decade after they joined in a massive merger that created one of the biggest food conglomerates on the planet.",
      "One of the companies, currently called Global Taste Elevation Co., will include shelf-stable meals and include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, Kraft Heinz said Tuesday. The other, currently called North American Grocery Co.,  will include brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The names of the two companies will be released later.",
      "Kraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split.",
      "The company's board \"unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into two independent, publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin-off,\" Kraft Heinz said.",
      "In 2015, when they merged, the company wanted to capitalize on its massive scale, but shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking to introduce healthier options at the table. Kraft Heinz and other food producers have shifted offerings to follow that trend.",
      "\"Kraft Heinz's brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\" Kraft Heinz Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz CEO  Carlos Abrams-Rivera said, \"This move will unleash the power of our brands and unlock the potential of our business. This next step in our transformation is only possible because of the commitment of our 36,000 talented employees who deliver quality and value for consumers every day. We will continue to operate as 'one Kraft Heinz' throughout the separation process.\"",
      "The path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.",
      "3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International \u2014 a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes \u2014 and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It's known for strict cost controls and so-called zero-based budgeting, which requires all expenses to be justified each quarter.",
      "The deal was intended to help Heinz, which was founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, expand sales of its condiments and sauces on grocery store shelves. Heinz's new owners also set about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of workers within months.",
      "At the same time Kraft, based in Chicago, sought a partner after a 2011 split from its snack division, which became Mondelez International.",
      "In 2015, Buffett and 3G decided to merge Heinz with Kraft. The merger created the 5th largest food and beverage company in the world, with annual revenue of $28 billion. Buffett and 3G each contributed $5 billion for a special dividend for Kraft shareholders.",
      "But the combined company struggled, despite layoffs of thousands of employees and other cost-cutting measures. Even at the time of the merger, many consumers were shifting away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that Kraft sells, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid.",
      "Kraft Heinz also had trouble distinguishing its products from cheaper store brands. At Walmart, a 14-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup costs $2.98; the same size bottle of Walmart's Great Value brand is 98 cents.",
      "In 2019, Kraft Heinz slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands by $15.4 billion, citing operational costs and supply chain problems. But many investors blamed the company's leadership, saying its zeal for cost-cutting was hurting brand innovation.",
      "In 2021, Kraft Heinz sold both its Planters nut business and its natural cheese business, vowing to reinvest the money into higher-growth brands like P3 protein snacks and Lunchables.",
      "But the company's net revenue has fallen every year since 2020, when it saw a pandemic-related bump in sales. In April, Kraft Heinz lowered its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing weaker customer spending in the U.S. and the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Carlos Abrams-Rivera will continue to serve as CEO of Kraft Heinz and will become CEO of North American Grocery Co. once the separation is complete. Kraft Heinz said its board is working with an executive search firm to identify potential CEO candidates for Global Taste Elevation Co.",
      "Kraft Heinz says it has no plans to change its current headquarter locations in Chicago and Pittsburgh. It currently expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2026.",

    "summary": "The number of immigrant workers has declined from January through the end of July, preliminary Census data shows.",
    "story": [
      "As millions of Americans gather Monday to celebrate Labor Day, federal data shows how President Trump's immigration policies are reshaping the U.S. workforce.",
      "The number of immigrant workers in the U.S. has declined by 1.2 million from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data, analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That figure includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "The labor market shakeup comes as the flow of immigrants into the U.S. has slowed significantly under Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on \"dangerous criminals,\" but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.",
      "The overall number of people in the U.S. illegally peaked at an estimated 14 million in 2023, according to a Pew Research Center\u00a0estimate. However, the number of unauthorized immigrants has likely declined since then \"due in part to increased deportations and reduced protections under the Trump administration,\" the authors of the Pew Research Center report said.",
      "In an Aug. 28 report, Oxford Economics projects the slowdown will persist through Mr. Trump's presidency, with net immigration falling to an annualized 500,000 by year-end and holding at that level until 2028.",
      "Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce, and data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.",
      "\"It's unclear how much of the decline we've seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,\" Kramer said. \"However, we don't believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn't real.\"",
      "To be sure, the loss of immigrant workers reflects a small share of the overall U.S. labor force of more than 171 million workers. But the decline could affect states and sectors that are more dependent on foreign workers, economists say.",
      "Potential implications for the labor market",
      "Immigrants play a key role in alleviating labor shortages, as the majority tend to be ages 25 to 54, Oxford Economics noted. Economists call that demographic \"prime working age\" because they tend to be in their most productive decades of work.",
      "Immigrants are also more willing to migrate to states with higher labor demand.",
      "\"This is critical to ease shortages in regional labor markets, especially as U.S. labor mobility has steadily declined since the 1980s,\" Oxford Economics researchers noted.",
      "However, states with large shares of undocumented residents \u2014 namely Louisiana, Florida and New York \u2014 are starting to see some of the biggest declines in unauthorized migration, the report says.",
      "Experts say the drop in workforce participation could ripple through the labor market, which is already under some strain as employers pull back on hiring. The average monthly payroll gain from May to July was only 35,000, down from an average of 123,000 from for the first four months of the year.",
      "\"The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that's where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,\" said Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \"That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.\"",
      "Immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S., according to Orrenius.",
      "The plunge in unauthorized immigration may also give the impression that the labor force is tighter than it actually is due to the higher ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, Oxford Economics said. That could muddy the picture of what's going on in the labor market, the authors say.",
      "\"The Fed is highly sensitive to the downside risks to the labor market, but the immigration reversal will continue to complicate the signals from the labor market data,\" they write.",
      "ICE raids take a toll on farms",
      "Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won't be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.",
      "Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.",
      "\"In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,\" she said.",
      "In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).",
      "Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.",
      "Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.",
      "\"People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,\" Tate said.",
      "Lidia, a farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.",
      "\"I don't know if I'll be able to bring my kids,\" said Lidia. \"I'm also very concerned I'd have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.\"",
      "Construction sites in and around McAllen also \"are completely dead,\" Rodriguez said.",
      "\"We have a large labor force that is undocumented,\" she said. \"We've seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.\"",
      "Construction jobs",
      "The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.",
      "\"Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,\" said Ken Simonson, the association's chief economist. \"But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn't disrupting labor supplies.\"",
      "This may just be the tip of the iceberg: The Oxford report authors say that the increase in funding for immigration enforcement from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could eventually lead to an \"even higher sustained rate of deportations.\"",
      "Kramer, with Pew, warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.",
      "The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president.",
      "\"What's going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?\" De La Cruz said. \"What happens when immigrants aren't in the field to pick our crops? Who's going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?\"",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that Mr. Trump went too far when he declared national emergencies to justify tariffs on nearly every country on Earth. The ruling largely upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York.",
      "But Friday's 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, giving his administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling represents a major setback for Mr. Trump, who has said his trade policies will enrich the U.S. by bringing back manufacturing jobs and contributing billions in new revenue for the federal government.",
      "\"This ruling highlights a serious legal threat to one of the president's most high-profile economic policies,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory company deVere Group, in an emailed report.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a\u00a0Truth Social post, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "Six of the seven judges who ruled against the tariffs are appointees of Democratic presidents, while the seventh is an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush. Of the four judges who dissented, two were appointed by former President Obama and two by former President George W. Bush.",
      "Here's what could happen next as the legal case proceeds.",
      "How did the dispute arise?",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a months-long legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses, which are arguing that the president has exceeded his authority in issuing the import duties.",
      "The appeals court's decision is focused on the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in April on most trading partners, along with earlier levies on China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 \u2014 or Liberation Day, he called it \u2014 imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.",
      "The president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. \u2014 and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did \u2014 including the U.K., Japan and the EU \u2014 and agreed to deals with Mr. Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.",
      "Countries that didn't comply faced higher tariffs earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Mr. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.",
      "What is the IEEPA?",
      "Mr. Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, by declaring longstanding U.S. trade deficits \"a national emergency.\"",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that illegal immigration and drug trafficking amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Mr. Trump has made the most of it.",
      "Does the ruling apply to all tariffs?",
      "No, the court's ruling doesn't cover all of Mr. Trump tariffs. For instance, his levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos were imposed under a different regulation after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.",
      "Nor does it include tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on China in his first term \u2014 and President Biden kept \u2014 after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.",
      "In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump's Liberation Day tariffs \"exceed any authority granted to the President'' under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "On Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that \"it seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.\"",
      "What happens next?",
      "The president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote on his social media platform on Friday.",
      "A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday's ruling clears a possible legal path for Mr. Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \"is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court's decisions,\" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.",
      "The government has argued that if Mr. Trump's tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.",
      "Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, such as American manufacturers or retailers that rely on foreign-made products. While the U.S. companies typically swallow some of the cost, they pass on much of the added expenses to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "The Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the U.S.",
      "It could also put Mr. Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.",
      "\"While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments or even seek to renegotiate terms,\" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.",
      "Does the Trump administration have other options?",
      "Mr. Trump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.",
      "For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Mr. Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits.",
      "The administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority \u2014 Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \u2014 as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and automobiles. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot be imposed at the president's sole discretion.",
      "\"Even if the tariffs are struck down, we believe the Trump administration will look for new ways to tax imports or otherwise raise revenue from companies selling into the U.S.,\" noted Green of the deVere Group.",

      "Olivia Fair graduated four years ago. \"I've applied to probably over a hundred jobs in the past, I don't know, six months,\" she said. \"And yeah, none of them are landing.\"",
      "She's had a series of short-term jobs - one was in TV production, transcribing interviews. \"But now they don't have a bunch of people transcribing,\" she said. \"They have maybe one person overseeing all of that, and AI doing the rest. Which I think is true for a lot of entry-level positions. And it can be a very useful tool for those people doing that work. But then there's less people needed.\"",
      "According to Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at Indeed, the job-listings website, job postings have declined year over year by 6.7 percent. \"This is a tough year,\" she said. \"Younger job seekers, specifically those who are recent grads, are having a harder time finding work.\"",
      "Asked if there is a correlation between the rise in AI and the decline in jobs for recent graduates, Ullrich said, \"I think there is a cause-and-effect, but it's maybe not as significant as a lot of people would think. If you look specifically at tech jobs, job postings are down 36% compared to pre-pandemic numbers. But that decline started happening prior to AI becoming commonly used.\"",
      "Ullrich said in 2021-22, as the effects of the COVID pandemic began to ebb, there was a hiring boom in some sectors, including tech: \"Quite frankly, I think some companies overhired,\" she said.",
      "The uncertain national situation (tariffs, taxes, foreign policy) doesn't help, either. Ullrich said, \"Some other people have used the analogy of, like, driving through fog.

    "summary": "A federal appeals court said many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible, but didn't halt them.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Friday that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible.",
      "The ruling will not immediately block the tariffs, but it marks a significant blow to Mr. Trump's signature trade strategy.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court decision that found many of Mr. Trump's tariffs on foreign goods exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws. However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.",
      "The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.",
      "The court's\u00a0ruling\u00a0will not take effect until October to give the Trump administration a chance to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "\"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said \"undermines the United States on the world stage\" and is \"interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.\"",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.",
      "The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs \"a core Congressional power,\" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.",
      "While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.",
      "Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates \u2014 but still left them with higher duties than before \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.",
      "But critics \u2014 and many economists \u2014 warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's \"Liberation Day\" dive.",
      "Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.",

      "Las Vegas saw a 12% decline in visitors compared to a year ago, hosting about 3.1 million people, according to LVCVA data.",
      "Convention attendance fell about 10% in June, then rose about 10% in July. Looking over a longer stretch, Hill said the meetings business is roughly flat and the next 16 months of bookings look especially strong.",
      "With social media griping about add-on costs, resorts are leaning into promotions.",
      "Recent examples include: Resorts World waiving resort fees and paid parking through Sept. 10, the Sahara Las Vegas Hotel offering free parking, late check-out and upgrades on select stays, Downtown Grand Hotel bundling dining credits, free slot play, no resort fee and The Strat touting \"Summer of Value\" rooms with taxes and fees included.",
      "The tourism agency is also pushing budget tips and free activities citywide.",
      "\"The idea that generally Las Vegas is not a value, that it is overpriced, I don't think our customers are doing math when they are concerned about a specific issue,\" Hill said. \"They're expressing concern about that specific topic, that tends to then move into a narrative around Las Vegas is expensive or Las Vegas is not a value, but if you actually do the math on that, that's not accurate.\"",
      "International travel remains mixed.",
      "Traffic from Canada is down about 18%, which Hill attributed in part to friction caused by politics and tariffs. By contrast, visits from Mexico, the United Kingdom and Australia are rising, with more flights into Las Vegas.",
      "He also criticized a $250 U.S. visa fee for travelers from non-waiver countries, costs that can top $1,000 for a family of four, and long processing times that he said suppress demand.",
      "Despite the downward trend in overall visitors, Nevada gaming revenue remains resilient, a sign that visitors who do come are still spending.",
      "Nevada casinos kept $1.36 billion from gamblers in July, up 4% from a year earlier, according to data from state regulators.",
      "The Las Vegas Strip drove the increase with $749 million, a 5.6% gain. Downtown Las Vegas rose 3.6%.",
      "Hill expects momentum to build in the fall, citing a packed events calendar and stronger bookings into December.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 19:50:55 -0400",
    "summary": "As of Aug. 29, shipments to the U.S. valued at less than $800 are subject to tariffs, potentially resulting in surprise costs for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The end of the de minimis tax loophole on Friday means that low-cost shipments to the U.S.\u00a0are no longer exempt from import duties, a potential hit to consumers ordering goods from abroad.",
      "Under the prior tax break, parcels containing goods worth less than $800 were not subject to tariffs, making many products from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, a cheaper alternative to U.S.-made items.",
      "Now, stepped-up duties apply to all online orders entering the U.S. That could lead to higher costs and longer delivery times given that customs agents must now inspect and process the shipments, experts said.",
      "\"This means that, when making e-commerce purchases from your favorite international sites that you didn't have to worry about paying duties on before \u2014 now you have to,\" Rathna Sharad, CEO and co-founder of FlavorCloud, a global logistics platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This increases the cost of common consumer goods, and it varies widely by category of product.\"",
      "In her case, Sharad said the cost of the Korean beauty products she likes has already risen about 15%. \"It's a massive change for U.S. consumers, and a big change for brands and retailers because they have to scramble to figure out their pricing strategies and what this means for them.\"",
      "The White House on July 30 announced it would suspend the de minimis treatment, calling it a \"catastrophic loophole\" that provided a pathway for opioids \"as well as other unsafe or below-market products that harm American workers and businesses\" to enter the U.S.",
      "The White house said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that the loophole was exploited by bad actors.",
      "\"Between 2015 and 2024, shipments that entered the United States under de minimis ballooned by over 900%,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"Thanks to President Trump's historic action, the days of criminal exporters and drug traffickers exploiting the de minimis loophole to flood our country with counterfeit goods, lead toys and illicit drugs like fentanyl are over.\"",
      "The International Trade Administration, a federal agency, also cited statements from companies praising the move.",
      "\"The de minimis loophole has long provided an opportunity for some importers & retailers to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. duties,\" Gap said Friday. \"These packages are also typically subject to minimal inspection, raising potential safety concerns for U.S. consumers. Closing this loophole strengthens our nation's supply chain integrity, improves consumer protection, and levels the playing field for all retailers.\"",
      "Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said on a call with reporters on Thursday that ending the exemption would generate up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues, while also creating thousands of jobs.",
      "How much pricier?",
      "According to a recent FlavorCloud\u00a0analysis, a pair of lined slippers made in China and shipped to the U.S. that previously cost $30 when the de minimis exemption was in force will now cost $44.37, an increase of 51%. That figure factors in several U.S.tariffs on imports: a 12.5% levy on slippers; 20% duty on Chinese goods; and a 10% universal tariff on all imports, as well as a $2.62 merchandise processing fee to calculate the new price.",
      "A nutritional supplement from Canada that formerly cost $37 will now run $60.17 with tariffs in effect, FlavorCloud also found. And a stainless steel water bottle from the U.K. that cost $15 when ordered online in the U.S. will see its price rise to $21.81 once tariffs are applied.",
      "Additionally, a chef's knife from Japan that previously sold for $240 online could cost $298.49 after accounting for applicable tariffs, according to the same analysis.",
      "To be sure, some foreign manufacturers could choose to absorb the cost of higher U.S. tariffs \u2014 which are typically paid by importers here at home \u2014 experts said.",
      "\"Because consumers want bargains, many companies may choose to bite the bullet and incur the increased import costs if they could remain competitive,\" said Augustine Lo, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, while noting that abolishing the de minimis loophole amounts to a heavy burden on small and midsize businesses.",
      "Indeed, for now tariffs have had relatively little impact on the rate of U.S. inflation, economic data shows, although forecasters note that it can take up to a year for levies to trickle into consumer prices.",
      "Avoiding surprise costs",
      "Shoppers can take certain steps to avoid being hit with surprise costs when ordering goods online from overseas.",
      "First, check a product's country of origin before making a purchase. U.S.-based sellers often ship goods from their warehouses abroad, which could greatly increase the cost of an item now that tariffs are being applied. More specifically, look for tariff surcharges listed as line items on companies' websites, and decide if the extra charges are worth the cost.",
      "For example, if the imports duties on a particular good exceed its value, it may not be worth buying. At minimum, factor in such added costs into your budget while shopping, FlavorCloud recommends.",
      "The bottom line is that the end of the de minimis loophole amounts to a major shift for consumers and businesses alike, according to Sean Henry, CEO and co-founder of Stord, an e-commerce fulfillment platform.",
      "\"It's a large change because over the last decade, de minimis has accounted for such a large portion of online sales,\" Henry told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol processed $65 billion worth of de minimis packages.",
      "\"It was a way to allow international sellers a fast path, with no paperwork or customs duties, into the U.S.,\" Henry said. \"It's like they were in the fast line at the airport and ran right through. Now, all of a sudden, those same packages are being put into general boarding, and it's going to slow everything down.\"",

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines again filed for bankruptcy protection from its debts only months after emerging from Chapter 11.",
    "story": [
      "Budget carrier Spirit Airlines said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection only months after emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization.",
      "The no-frills airline said it intends to conduct business as normal during the restructuring process, meaning passengers can continue to book trips and use their tickets, credits and loyalty points. The company said its employees and contractors would still be paid.",
      "Spirit CEO Dave Davis said the airline's previous Chapter 11 petition\u00a0focused on reducing debt and raising capital, and since exiting that process in March \"it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future.\"",
      "In a quarterly report issued earlier this month, Spirit Aviation Holdings, the carrier's parent company, said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for running out of money. Spirit cited \"adverse market conditions\" the company faced after its most recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.",
      "That included weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year, and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "Troubles since the pandemic",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit has said it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines \u2014 many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings \u2014 Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",
      "Spirit operates 5,013 flights to 88 destinations in the U.S., the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama and Colombia, according to travel search engine Skyscanner.net",

    "story": [
      "Inflation continued to run hot in July, underlining the Federal Reserve's dilemma as it looks to lower prices for American consumers while propping up a job market that is starting to wobble.",
      "Prices across the U.S. rose at an annual rate of 2.6% last month, according to personal consumption expenditures data released on Friday. That's the same figure as in June, a sign inflation remains persistent. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, inflation in July actually ticked up to 2.9% from a year ago, up from 2.8% in June.",
      "Read on for a breakdown of Friday's PCE report.",
      "How are consumers faring?",
      "The latest PCE data shows that consumer spending rose 0.5% in July, suggesting that Americans are continuing to open their wallets even in the face of economic uncertainty.",
      "But while people continue to spend, many consumers are increasingly having to make trade-offs on what they spend their money on, Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Consumers are trying to push through \u2014 they're doing the best they can, but they're increasingly under pressure, and therefore they're being more cautious with discretionary outlets,\" he said. \"They travel less. They spend less on restaurants, spend more cautiously on transportation.\"",
      "Such caution can augur a deeper slump given that consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity. The closely watched University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, released Friday, showed that Americans are increasingly concerned about inflation.",
      "Although inflation has cooled significantly since peaking in 2022, it remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% annual target. And consumers continue to feel the pain in the form of higher prices for some groceries as well as rising electricity costs. Another key inflation gauge \u2014 the\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0\u2014 shows that the price of coffee was up 14.8% from a year ago, while beef and egg costs were 15.5% and 16.4%, respectively.",
      "Are tariffs impacting inflation?",
      "Not yet. In a positive sign, the price of goods, which are most susceptible to tariffs than services, cooled slightly in July, the PCE data shows, decreasing 0.1% from the month prior. That suggests tariffs have had a minimal impact on prices so far.",
      "\"It's not showing up in a goods prices, in the government statistics at least,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "\"We continue to expect tariffs to take a growing bite out of growth in real income and real consumer spending,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report.",
      "A critical question facing the economy is whether any tariff-induced inflation amounts to a one-time boost to prices or results in a more prolonged increase. Fed Chair Jerome Powell laid out the scenarios in a\u00a0speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, earlier this month, noting that even if inflation does end up being a \"one-time\" scenario, it will still \"take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-trump-attempt-remove-lisa-cook-federal-governor/",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:28:52 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced earlier this week that he would be removing Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
      "The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.",
      "Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises \"important questions that may be of first impression\" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the \"unique functions\" of the central bank and the importance \"of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.\"",
      "Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors \"for cause.\"",
      "In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.",
      "\"This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice\" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that \"cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.\"",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the \"for cause\" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws \u2014 inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \u2014\u00a0 into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to \"cause.\" She also asked Lowell to provide the \"best authority\" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.",
      "Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.",
      "Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that \"making facially contradictory statements in financial documents \u2014 whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not \u2014 is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.\"",
      "They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes \"cause,\" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.",
      "\"Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve \u2014 a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes \"cause,\" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was \"uncomfortable\" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to \"go dig in\" and find reasons to remove sitting members.",
      "\"What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?\" she asked Roth. \"That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?\"",
      "Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.",
      "Cobb, though, also said she had a \"strong reaction\" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.",
      "As to the timing of the alleged misconduct \u2014 Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board \u2014 Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, \"it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.\"",

Spending jumped sharply for long-lasting goods such as cars, appliances and furniture, many of which are imported.",
      "Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note that the rise in the core inflation measure was due to a rise in core services, which rose 0.3% on a monthly basis. That suggests tariffs are having a \"minimal impact on goods prices,\" he wrote.",

      "The new facility \u2014 which is located inside the Louisiana State Penitentiary, commonly known as Angola \u2014 is designed to house more than 400 detainees.",
      "The facility was given the name Camp 57 after Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry being the 57th governor of the state. Federal officials have also dubbed Camp 57 as \"Louisiana Lockup.\" In a news release, the Department of Homeland Security described it as part of a \"new partnership\" between the Trump administration and the state of Louisiana.",

      "\"This is not just a typical ICE detention facility that you will see elsewhere in the country,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference Wednesday in front of Camp 57, alongside Bondi and Landry.",
      "She said some of the men who have already transferred there were convicted of serious crimes, including murder and rape.",
      "\"Louisiana is one of several states stepping up to solve these problems,\" Noem said.",
      "Noem also indicated that Angola's \"notorious\" history was one of the reasons that it was chosen for Camp 57.",
      "\"This is a facility that's notorious, it's a facility, Angola Prison is legendary \u2014 but that's a message that these individuals that are going to be here, that are illegal criminals, need to understand,\" Noem told reporters.",
      "During Wednesday's news conference, Landry said the facility is next to a lake \"full of alligators\" and surrounded by a \"forest full of bears.\" An officer with the Louisiana Department of Corrections told CBS News Wednesday there are alligators as big as 10 feet in the lake.",
      "Camp 57 has a chapel and law library, law enforcement officials familiar with the project told CBS News Wednesday.",
      "The facility, which will house only men, is separated from the rest of the Louisiana state prisoners incarcerated in the Angola complex, which spans 18,000 acres.",
      "Camp 57 was shuttered for many years before renovations started about a month ago. DHS officials said it was renovated into working order in about 30 days.",
      "Prior to its closure, Camp 57 had been used for disciplinary actions against state prisoners, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the project.",
      "Transferring ICE detainees between facilities isn't new but has increased under the current administration. A CBS News analysis of government data found that more than half of immigrants detained by ICE between Jan. 20, 2025, and July 29, 2025, were transferred to another facility two or more times \u2014 a greater share than during the Biden administration, the first Trump administration or the second Obama administration.",
      "Detainees are also getting shuffled further away during these transfers, CBS News found. Under the current administration, about 61% of detainees who started their stay were transferred more than 100 miles at least once. That's also a higher figure than in past administrations.",
      "Some immigration advocates are concerned this practice could make it more difficult for detainees to contact loved ones or their attorneys.",
      "Asked about the increase in detention transfers and how and when ICE determines someone should be transferred, Noem said Wednesday that \"this specific facility is going to host most dangerous criminal illegal aliens in the country, because it is so secure. Those individuals are being moved from other facilities around the country...because it is so secure behind these fences. I would say that we move people to other facilities for logistics, based on what country they're being repatriated from, where their flights are going, what we need to do to build deficiencies, and we will continue to do that as we need to in order to deport them out of the country and take them back home.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court a lower court decision that found many of his tariffs are unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court late Wednesday to review a federal appeals court decision that found many of his tariffs are illegal, warning that the ruling threatens to \"unilaterally disarm the United States and allow other nations to hold America's economy hostage to their retaliatory trade policies.\"",
      "The appeal from the Justice Department was expected. Mr. Trump said this week that his administration would turn to the high court and ask it to speed up consideration of the case. The case has not yet been docketed by the Supreme Court.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a 7-4 decision last Friday that Mr. Trump did not have the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under a federal emergency powers law, derailing a major component of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. But the appeals court said its ruling will not take effect until at least Oct. 14 to allow the Justice Department time to seek the Supreme Court's review.",
      "The administration wants the Supreme Court to decide whether a federal emergency powers law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, authorizes the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, and whether the law unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority to the president.",
      "It could be weeks before the high court decides whether to weigh in on the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs and, if it decides to do so, months before a decision is handed down.",
      "The president has warned that \"our country is going to suffer greatly\" if the Supreme Court upholds the lower court's decision on the tariffs.",
      "\"The stakes in this case could not be higher. The President and his Cabinet officials have determined that the tariffs are promoting peace and unprecedented economic prosperity, and that the denial of tariff authority would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses and thrust America back to the brink of economic catastrophe,\" the administration said in a filing. \"To the President and his most senior advisors, these tariffs thus present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation.\"",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote the Federal Circuit's ruling jeopardizes framework agreements that the Trump administration has negotiated with a handful of trading partners and puts ongoing talks at risk.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to expedite its review of the case. It proposed that the justices decide whether to take up the issue by next week, with all briefs due by late October and oral arguments in early November \u2014 an unusually fast timeline for the high court. The Justice Department included a statement from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that argued a quick resolution is necessary because the appeals court ruling \"gravely undermines the President's ability to conduct real-world diplomacy.\"",
      "Sauer indicated in the filing that the plaintiffs in the case agreed to the proposed schedule.",
      "Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel of the Liberty Justice Center, which is representing a group of small businesses that challenged the tariffs, said he is confident they will prevail before the Supreme Court.",
      "\"These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival,\" he said in a statement Wednesday. \"We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients.\"",
      "The tariffs at issue in the case include those imposed by Mr. Trump through executive action taken in April that set a 10% baseline rate on nearly every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also involves a set of duties imposed on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "The Federal Circuit upheld a May ruling from the U.S. Court of International Trade that found Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued his tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "But the levies are still in effect despite the Federal Circuit's decision, since it tossed out a permanent injunction issued by the trade court that universally blocked enforcement of the tariffs.",
      "In its unsigned decision, the Federal Circuit said that the right to impose tariffs are a \"core congressional power.\" The majority said in other statutes delegating tariff power to the president, Congress has set \"specific substantive limitations and procedural guidelines\" to be followed when leaving those duties.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has used tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trading partners into negotiations, and said the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. He has announced frameworks of trade deals with countries like the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Wednesday's court filing argued that IEEPA gives the president \"broad discretion\" to regulate trade, including by imposing tariffs.",
      "\"There is nothing new or suspect about IEEPA's broad delegation of tariff authority to address national emergencies,\" Sauer wrote. \"Congress has long supplemented the President's Article II foreign-affairs powers by delegating capacious authority to impose tariffs that, in the President's judgment, will advance national security, foster economic prosperity, or facilitate negotiations with foreign counterparts.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 21:05:24 -0400",
    "summary": "The decision from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs is a massive victory for Harvard University.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration violated Harvard University's First Amendment rights and federal law when it froze nearly $2 billion in federal grants because of the Ivy League school's handling of antisemitism on campus.",
      "In a victory for Harvard, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs blocked Trump administration officials from implementing or instituting orders freezing the grant funding to Harvard and letters terminating research grants awarded by a slew of federal agencies.",
      "Burroughs wrote in her 84-page decision that Harvard has been \"plagued\" by antisemitism in recent years and should have done more to deal with the issue. But she found that there is \"little connection between the research affected by the grant terminations and antisemitism.\"",
      "\"In fact, a review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities, and did so in a way that runs afoul of the APA, the First Amendment and Title VI,\" Burroughs wrote. \"Further, their actions have jeopardized decades of research and the welfare of all those who could stand to benefit from that research, as well as reflect a disregard for the rights protected by the Constitution and federal statutes.\"",
      "The decision is a significant win for Harvard, which has been targeted by the Trump administration in recent months. The administration has sought to punish Harvard over what it says is its failure to condemn antisemitism and protect Jewish students on campus. But it has also criticized the school's hiring and admissions practices.",
      "White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston told CBS News in a statement that the Trump administration will appeal the decision.",
      "\"Just as President Trump correctly predicted on the day of the hearing, this activist Obama-appointed judge was always going to rule in Harvard's favor, regardless of the facts,\" Huston said. \"To any fair-minded observer, it is clear that Harvard University failed to protect their students from harassment and allowed discrimination to plague their campus for years. Harvard does not have a constitutional right to taxpayer dollars and remains ineligible for grants in the future. We will immediately move to appeal this egregious decision, and we are confident we will ultimately prevail in our efforts to hold Harvard accountable.\"",
      "In a statement posted to the university's website Wednesday evening, Harvard President Alan Garber wrote that \"the ruling affirms Harvard's First Amendment and procedural rights, and validates our arguments in defense of the University's academic freedom, critical scientific research, and the core principles of American higher education.\"",
      "The Trump administration sent a letter to Harvard leaders in April that contained a list of demands, and after the university rejected the terms, administration officials announced it had frozen more than $2.2 billion in grants and contracts to Harvard. The school later received letters from nine federal agencies canceling research grants.",
      "The Trump administration's cuts to federal funding to Harvard have continued, and Mr. Trump has also threatened to revoke the school's tax-exempt status.",
      "Harvard sued the Trump administration over the funding freeze in April, claiming the move was part of a \"pressure campaign\" by the White House to \"force Harvard to submit to the government's control over its academic programs,\" and views on anti-Israel speech on its campus. Both Harvard and the Justice Department asked Burroughs to go straight to a decision on the merits of the suit without a trial.",
      "In her ruling, Burroughs called the Trump administration's actions part of a \"government-initiated onslaught\" against the school that was \"much more about promoting a governmental orthodoxy in violation of the First Amendment than about anything else, including fighting antisemitism.\"",
      "\"Harvard is currently, even if belatedly, taking steps it needs to take to combat antisemitism and seems willing to do even more if need be,\" Burroughs wrote. \"Now it is the job of the courts to similarly step up, to act to safeguard academic freedom and freedom of speech as required by the Constitution, and to ensure that important research is not improperly subjected to arbitrary and procedurally infirm grant terminations, even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost.\"",
      "Burroughs said that the Trump administration was right to investigate antisemitic behavior on Harvard's campus, but said that focus was not the \"true aim\" of the funding freeze. Instead, she agreed with Harvard that the administration retaliated against it in violation of its First Amendment rights.",
      "\"Harvard was wrong to tolerate hateful behavior for as long as it did,\" Burroughs wrote. \"The record here, however, does not reflect that fighting antisemitism was Defendants' true aim in acting against Harvard and, even if it were, combating antisemitism cannot be accomplished on the back of the First Amendment.\"",
      "Burroughs said that none of the letters the Trump administration sent to Harvard \"identified any specific instance of antisemitism on Harvard's campus, specified how Harvard failed to respond to any such acts of antisemitism in a way that violated Title VI, or reflected any effort to follow the Title VI procedural requirements that govern the termination of federal funding.\"",
      "In addition to targeting Harvard's federal funding, the Trump administration has also taken aim at its ability to enroll international students. Harvard sued the government over its efforts, and in June, Burroughs\u00a0blocked the Trump administration from revoking the university's ability to enroll foreign students. The Justice Department has appealed that decision.",
      "The feud between the Trump administration and Harvard continued in August, after the Trump administration signaled that it could take control of the school's patents stemming from federally funded research.",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled against President Trump's use of an 18th century wartime law to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled against President Trump's use of an 18th century wartime law to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, finding \"no invasion or predatory incursion.\"",
      "The Trump administration deported hundreds of accused Tren de Aragua gang members earlier this year using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, an obscure law that allows the president to remove citizens of an enemy country during an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" Some of those migrants were later flown to a supermax prison in El Salvador \u2014 though many of the detainees were sent to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap in July.",
      "The strategy has drawn a litany of court challenges, many of which argue the U.S. isn't facing an \"invasion\" or migrants aren't receiving enough due process to contest their deportations. A \"60 Minutes\" investigation found many migrants sent to El Salvador didn't have criminal records.",
      "Tuesday's ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit marks the latest court decision to push back on the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling \u2014 which was issued by a three-judge panel, with one dissenter \u2014 found the situation with Tren de Aragua does not meet the definition of either an \"invasion\" or a \"predatory incursion.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued\u00a0that Tren de Aragua is engaged in an incursion because its members have perpetrated \"mass illegal migration.\" The appeals court rejected this argument.",
      "\"A country's encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt, or to otherwise harm the United States,\" the court said. \"There is no finding that this mass immigration was an armed, organized force or forces.\"",
      "The appellate judges granted a preliminary injunction blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove migrants who sued in the Northern District of Texas. The court said the government can still remove the migrants under other legal authorities.",
      "American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt, who represents the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling \"an incredibly important win reigning in the administration's view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration's attempt to use a wartime statute during peacetime to regulate immigration was rightly shut down by the court,\" he wrote in a statement.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson argued Mr. Trump used the Alien Enemies Act lawfully.",
      "\"The authority to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists from the United States rests solely with the President,\" Jackson said.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the ruling \"will not be the final say on the matter,\" and asserted: \"Unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people.\"",
      "The ruling came in a case that has darted back and forth through the federal judiciary for months, eventually reaching the Supreme Court in the spring.",
      "The case was brought by migrants who were detained in Texas and sued to block their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. The district court did not grant them relief, and the Fifth Circuit said they didn't have jurisdiction to intervene. But the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the migrants' removal in April, and a month later, the high court said the Fifth Circuit was wrong to dismiss the appeal and sent the case back to the appellate court for further review.",
      "The Supreme Court also said the government hadn't given the migrants enough notice of their impending deportations, after they said they were told just 24 hours in advance.",
      "Since then, the government has filed an updated notice that gave migrants seven days' warning of their deportation. The Fifth Circuit said that's likely enough time to satisfy the migrants' right to due process, but sent the issue back to the district court for further review.",
      "The ruling was penned by Judge Leslie Southwick, who was nominated by President George W. Bush. Biden-nominated Judge Irma Carrillo Ramirez concurred with the part of the ruling that said there isn't an \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion,\" but said seven days' notice isn't enough.",
      "Judge Andrew Oldham, whom Mr. Trump nominated during his first term, dissented.",
      "\"For 227 years, every President of every political party has enjoyed the same broad powers to repel threats to our Nation under the Alien Enemies Act ('AEA'). And from the dawn of our Nation until President Trump took office a second time, courts have never second-guessed the President's invocation of that Act. Not once,\" he wrote, arguing only the president can decide if the law applies. \"For President Trump, however, the rules are different.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to terminate the legal status and work permits of nearly 270,000 Venezuelan migrants enrolled in the Temporary Protected Status program, urging them to self-deport from the U.S.",
      "The announcement marked the latest effort by the Trump administration to revoke humanitarian protections granted to hundreds of thousands of migrants from countries plagued by political turmoil, war and other crises, making them eligible for potential deportation.",
      "Unless blocked in court, the move by the Department of Homeland Security will terminate the legal protections of Venezuelans enrolled in a TPS program created in 2021 by the Biden administration. Homeland Security officials said roughly 268,000 Venezuelans are covered under the 2021 program, and their status would lapse in the next 60 days.",
      "Earlier in the year, the Trump administration, following a decision by the Supreme Court, terminated another TPS designation issued in 2023 that covered roughly 350,000 Venezuelans, most of whom crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally or entered the country legally under now-defunct Biden-era programs.",
      "The 2021 program covers a separate group of Venezuelan migrants who have been in the U.S. for longer.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem determined that keeping the 2021 program would not be in the best interest of the country, arguing that TPS incentivizes illegal immigration.",
      "\"Given Venezuela's substantial role in driving irregular migration and the clear magnet effect created by Temporary Protected Status, maintaining or expanding TPS for Venezuelan nationals directly undermines the Trump Administration's efforts to secure our southern border and manage migration effectively,\" Tragesser added.",
      "Those who lose their TPS protections and don't have any other legal means to remain in the U.S. \u2014 such as applications for asylum or permanent American residency \u2014 could face arrest and deportation by federal immigration officials.",

Officials have offered self-deportees a $1,000 bonus if they return to their home countries.",
      "Created in 1990 by Congress as a way to provide a temporary safe haven to migrants from countries beset by armed conflict, environmental disasters or other emergencies, TPS has been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. It has argued the policy has been abused by Democratic administrations and unnecessarily extended for far too long, despite its temporary nature.",
      "Over the past months, the Trump administration has also announced the termination of TPS programs for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.",

      "The president had told reporters\u00a0Tuesday that \"we're going in\" to Chicago, but \"I didn't say when.\" The comments came weeks after Mr. Trump deployed Guard forces to the streets of Washington, D.C., as part of a controversial anti-crime push, and suggested during that time that Chicago could be next.",
      "Asked by reporters for details on a possible Guard deployment in Chicago, Vance deferred to Mr. Trump on Wednesday, before saying: \"There are no immediate plans, but the president has said he has the legal authority to protect American citizens, whether that's in Chicago or in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Vance said the Trump administration hopes to work with Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, echoing the president, who said Tuesday he wants Pritzker to request that military forces be sent to Chicago to quell violent crime.",

Other cities could follow: Mr. Trump suggested Tuesday he's also planning to take action in Baltimore, and he said Wednesday he's weighing a deployment in New Orleans.",
      "Thousands of California National Guard forces were sent to Los Angeles starting in June, part of a mission to protect federal immigration agents and property from what Mr. Trump described as out-of-control, violent protests. And last month, the president sent members of the D.C. National Guard and federal law enforcement agents to the streets of the nation's capital.",

      "Governor Ron DeSantis and state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo have announced that Florida will work to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates in the state, making it the first in the nation to do so. Vaccines protecting against once-common and sometimes deadly childhood diseases like polio and measles have long been required for children at schools across the U.S.",
      "DeSantis also announced on Wednesday the creation of a state-level \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission modeled after similar initiatives pushed at the federal level by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The vaccine announcement, which Ladapo said would allow people to make their own decisions, drew criticism from physician groups and other health leaders who stress that the vaccines are safe and the most effective way to stop the spread of communicable diseases, especially among schoolchildren.",
      "\"When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun,\" Dr. Rana Alissa, chair of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in an email. \"When children are sick and miss school, caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.\"",
      "Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department in Texas, described the idea of dropping school vaccine requirements as \"insane and stupid.\"",
      "\"People forget the successes that we've seen with these vaccines. Before we had the polio vaccine, there were almost 60,000 cases in the U.S. each year, and almost 14,000 cases of paralytic polio,\" Huang told CBS News. \"Parents waited fearfully every summer to see if it would strike.\"",
      "He noted it was similar for measles, which caused 48,000 hospitalizations and 450 to 500 deaths each year before the vaccine was introduced in the 1960s. Earlier this year, lower vaccination rates in some communities enabled the spread of the biggest measles outbreak in decades.",
      "\"it's so important to get those vaccination levels up so it protects everyone,\" Huang said.",

      "Ladapo, who has frequently\u00a0clashed with the medical establishment, cast current vaccine requirements in schools and elsewhere as an \"immoral\" intrusion on people's rights bordering on \"slavery,\" and said they hamper parents' ability to make health decisions for their children.",
      "\"People have a right to make their own decisions, informed decisions,\" Ladapo said at a news conference in Valrico, Florida, in the Tampa area. \"They don't have the right to tell you what to put in your body. Take it away from them.\"",
      "The state Health Department, Ladapo said, can scrap its own rules for some vaccine mandates, but others would require action by the Florida Legislature. He did not specify any particular vaccines but repeated several times the effort would end \"all of them. Every last one of them.\"",
      "Florida would be the first state to eliminate so many vaccine mandates, Ladapo added.",
      "Ladapo said his department will work with lawmakers to make it happen. But the idea received immediate pushback from some officials.",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 current and former Health and Human Services employees penned an open letter Wednesday calling for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to either resign or be fired.",
      "The letter \u2014 whose signatories were not publicly named \u2014 was released at a tense time for the health agency. Last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired, and several other top CDC officials resigned from their jobs in protest. Staff are also reeling from layoffs, changes to the vaccine approval system \u2014 led by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 and a shooting outside the CDC headquarters last month.",
      "Wednesday's letter accused Kennedy of \"endangering the nation's health.\" It cited last week's upheaval at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to rescind emergency approvals that made the COVID-19 vaccines available for young children, and the elevation of \"political ideologues who pose as scientific experts\" to key vaccine approval posts.",
      "It called for Kennedy to resign, and said that if he declines to leave his post voluntarily, President Trump should pick a new HHS secretary.",
      "\"We swore an oath to support and defend the United States Constitution and to serve the American people. Our oath requires us to speak out when the Constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,\" the letter reads.",
      "The letter was released by a group called Save HHS, which penned a similar open letter last month urging Kennedy to \"stop spreading inaccurate health information.\"",
      "The group said the signatories for Wednesday's letter were provided to members of Congress, but weren't publicly listed due to security and privacy concerns.",
      "HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon responded to the letter by defending Kennedy's record and arguing he is working to restore trust in a \"broken\" CDC.",
      "\"From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door \u2014 and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\" Nixon said. \"That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Separately, nine former CDC directors wrote a New York Times op-ed on Monday that castigated Kennedy for making decisions they said were \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" and argued Monarez's firing \"adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday morning, where he's likely to face questions about the tumult at HHS.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed that Monarez was fired. Her lawyers called the firing \"legally deficient\" and said she was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",
      "At least four other senior CDC leaders also stepped down last week, in some cases penning resignation letters that decried cuts to the CDC, accused the Trump administration of an \"ongoing weaponizing of public health\" and blasted \"misinformation\" about vaccines.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee, said the resignations will \"require oversight.\" He also sits on the Senate Finance Committee.",

      "Parnell said the Defense Department attorneys would help with the backlog of cases \"by presiding over immigration hearings.\" The Associated Press first reported the Pentagon's plans.",
      "The immigration courts are struggling with a backlog of more than 3.4 million cases. But the plan to turn possibly hundreds of military lawyers into immigration judges comes after the Trump administration has fired more than two dozen immigration judges nationwide so far this year. Unlike federal district court judges, immigration judges work for the Justice Department.",
      "Judge Advocate General Corps officers are tasked with providing legal support to service members and their families or advising commanders on the legalities of warfare. The defense lawyers would likely need to undergo some training in immigration law, procedure and policy.",
      "The Trump administration loosened the job requirements for temporary immigration judges last month, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to handle cases in immigration court. Its new rule, published in the Federal Register in late August, states that the Justice Department \"no longer believes the restriction of [temporary immigration judges] to current Department employees with a threshold level of immigration law experience serves [the Executive Office for Immigration Review's] interests.\"",
      "Previously, only Justice Department lawyers with a decade of immigration law experience or former immigration judges could fill those roles.",
      "The American Immigration Lawyers Association criticized the plan in a statement after the new rule was published.",
      "\"While DoD attorneys may be well suited to handle military matters, immigration law is entirely different and exceptionally complex,\" AILA said. \"It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement.\"",
      "\"The work of immigration judges has been described as life and death decisions in traffic court conditions,\" the statement continued. \"Expecting fair decisions from judges unfamiliar with the law is absurd. This reckless move guts due process and further undermines the integrity of our immigration court system.\"",
      "The group called on Congress to use its oversight powers \"to defend the rule of law and protect the independence of the immigration judiciary.\"",
      "In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has already proposed loaning National Guard troops to the federal government for use as immigration judges. He said in May that his office had submitted a proposal to the Trump administration that would activate the nine Florida National Guard members who are Judge Advocate General Corps officers to serve as immigration judges, which legal experts told CBS News is unprecedented.",
      "Typically, when National Guard troops help after a hurricane or secure a protest site, they remain under the command of their state governor, under Title 32 of the U.S. Code. Under DeSantis' plan, the state would relinquish control of these officers to Washington. Title 10 would snap into place, reassigning the JAG officers under the command of the president and defense secretary. This grants them eligibility to serve as federal immigration judges, appointed by the U.S. attorney general.",
      "The Justice Department will pick up the tab for the operation if adopted. It plans to train the officers over six weeks \u2014 a crash course in immigration law, procedure and policy. Each officer would need to pass a written exam before donning the judge's robe.",

      "Washington \u2014 What was happening in the criminal case of Nathalie Rose Jones, who was facing charges in Washington, D.C., federal court this summer, wasn't typical.",
      "A grand jury of D.C. citizens on Tuesday had denied the Justice Department's request to indict Jones, who was accused of a federal crime for allegedly posting an Instagram threat against President Trump.",
      "In the nearly empty, dimly lit courtroom, Judge Moxila Upadhyaya listened to arguments from attorneys for nearly 15 minutes and surveyed the case file before her. She paused, looked up at the federal prosecutor standing 10 feet away and asked what the Justice Department planned to do next in the case.",
      "The prosecutor had no answer but said he'd have a response \"as soon as possible,\" maybe within a few days.",
      "This grand jury's rejection of the Justice Department's request for an indictment was one of at least four such instances in the past week in which a grand jury denied an indictment in the District of Columbia.",
      "\"Not only have I never heard of this happening, I've never heard of a prosecutor who's heard of this happening,\" said former federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou, who served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for in D.C. until January 2025.",
      "\"This is not the fault of career prosecutors, but rather the office's failure\u2014again and again\u2014to secure indictments suggests that the administration has absolutely destroyed its credibility with jurors,\" Ballou told CBS News.",
      "Another former federal prosecutor, Victor Salgado, said, \"It is exceptionally rare for federal grand juries to reject proposed charges, given the low evidentiary bar for indictment and the Justice Department's policy of pursuing cases only when there is sufficient evidence to both secure and sustain a conviction.\"",
      "Jones is accused of posting on Instagram in early August, \"I am willing to sacrificially kill this POTUS by disemboweling him and cutting out his trachea with Liz Cheney and all The Affirmation present.\"",
      "According to the Justice Department, on Aug. 15, the U.S. Secret Service conducted a voluntary interview with Jones, during which she stated the president was a \"terrorist\" and a \"Nazi.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said, \"A Washington D.C. grand jury refused to indict someone who threatened to kill the President of the United States. Her intent was clear, traveling through five states to do so. She even confirmed the same to the US Secret Service. This is the essence of a politicized jury. The system here is broken on many levels. Instead of the outrage that should be engendered by a specific threat to kill the president, the grand jury in DC refuses to even let the judicial process begin.\"",
      "Jones was briefly held in pretrial detention in the case last month but was released ahead of Tuesday's hearing. She appeared by Zoom at the hearing in Upadhyaya's courtroom and listened as a prosecutor told the judge that the feds have not decided whether to return to the grand jury for a second time to seek an indictment.",
      "Her attorney argued in a court filing this week that Jones possessed no firearms and \"she repeatedly told them she had no intent to harm anyone, including the president, and was in D.C., to attend a peaceful protest.\"",
      "In a separate case, multiple people familiar with the decision said a grand jury refused a Justice Department request to indict Sean Dunn, who was accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent in August. Dunn is a former Justice Department employee who was fired after news circulated of his arrest in the sandwich case. The Justice Department has instead filed a new misdemeanor count against Dunn, which does not require a grand jury indictment.",
      "Court records reviewed by CBS News said a D.C. grand jury also rejected a Justice Department request to indict Sydney Reid, who was arrested in July for allegedly attempting to interfere with the transfer of an alleged gang member into immigration custody.",
      "\"As Reid tried to impede the transfer, one of the (officers) pushed her against the wall and told her to stop,\" the Justice Department alleged in a complaint. \"Reid continued to struggle and fight with the officer.\"",
      "The Justice Department acknowledged in a court filing on Aug. 25 in Reid's case that \"[a]n Indictment has not been returned.\"",
      "Last week, a D.C. grand jury also declined to indict Alvin Summers, who was accused of swinging his arms at a U.S. Park Police officer after a foot chase on Aug. 15. Prosecutors alleged Summers \"grabbed\" the officer with force, and charged him with assaulting and resisting an officer.",
      "Shortly after the grand jury rejected the case, a defense attorney for Summers filed a motion in court, which argued, \"Mr. Summers should not be forced to live under the threat of later charges and rearrest. The charges against Mr. Summers were based on an allegation made by one officer who was wearing a body-worn camera. That officer's testimony was rejected by the grand jury, presumably after reviewing the body-worn camera video.\"",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss Summers's case on Aug. 29.",
      "The trajectory of Jones' case was less clear after Tuesday's hearing. Upadhyaya scheduled a hearing for Monday, but declined Jones' request to loosen the restrictions governing her release from pretrial detention.",
      "The reasons these D.C. grand juries have not handed up indictments in these cases are not known, but Salgado suggested it might be possible that in each of these cases \"that they disagreed with the Justice Department's theory of prosecution.\"",
      "\"It is not difficult to imagine 12 D.C. jurors concluding that throwing a sandwich at a federal officer \u2014 while clearly objectionable and potentially unlawful \u2014 does not amount to felony assault,\" Salgado said. \"At its core, the federal grand jury functions as a vital constitutional safeguard and a critical check on prosecutorial discretion, as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. had struck the boat\u00a0in international waters after it had departed from Venezuela. The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social\u00a0that 11 people were killed in the strike.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Tuesday that he believed the drugs were headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or another country in the Caribbean.

      "\"You want to try to traffic drugs, it's a new day,\" the defense secretary said. \"It's a different day, and so those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"",
      "Hegseth said that assets will remain in the region, and that further strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" he said. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0directed the military\u00a0to target drug cartels in Latin America last month. In August, the U.S. said the Navy would increase its presence near Venezuela and deploy multiple warships as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0called the move\u00a0an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" Maduro responded by deploying\u00a0warships and drones to Venezuela's coastline.",

      "On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" that Pritzker should be \"welcoming support and outside efforts to come alongside him, just as the mayor of Washington mostly has.\"",

      "Mr. Trump\u00a0also suggested Baltimore could also draw a federal response.",
      "The president has vowed for weeks to intervene in Chicago and Baltimore, arguing the two cities have failed to contain violent crime. Chicago could be the third city to face a crackdown under the Trump administration: Thousands of Guard troops and federal agents have been deployed to the streets of Washington, D.C., since last month as part of an anti-crime initiative, and Guard forces were sent to Los Angeles in June to protect immigration agents.",
      "Mr. Trump said he hopes Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker \u2014 a vociferous Trump critic \u2014 will call him and request that troops be sent to Chicago. But the president said: \"We're going to do it anyway. We have the right to do it because I have an obligation to protect this country.\"",
      "In a press conference Tuesday, Pritzker called Mr. Trump's comments \"unhinged.\"",
      "\"No, I will not call the president asking him to send troops to Chicago,\" he said.",

Mr. Trump called members of the California National Guard into federal service without Gov. Gavin Newsom's permission by invoking a law that applies to rebellions or situations where the president can't enforce the law with \"regular forces.\"",
      "Newsom sued the Trump administration over the move. An appeals court ruled that Mr. Trump likely had the right to call up the California National Guard, but a lower court judge on Tuesday ruled the deployment violated a 19th century law prohibiting the military from being used for domestic law enforcement.",
      "Trump calls Chicago a \"mess\" \u2014 Pritzker calls his claims \"absurd\"",
      "The president has zeroed in on cracking down on crime in the nation's major cities, beginning with the effort in D.C. \u2014 despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the crackdown in the nation's capital, he said the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and suggesting it could then move to other cities. Since then, he has publicly lashed out over Chicago's murder rate.",
      "\"We have other cities also that are bad. Very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is,\" Mr. Trump said last month. \"We're not going to lose our cities over this.\"",

      "A painting of Gen. Robert E. Lee dressed in his Confederate uniform is back on display in the West Point's library, several years after the storied academy removed honors to the Civil War military leader.",
      "There also are plans to restore a bust of Lee that had been removed from a plaza at the U.S. Military Academy, and a quote from Lee about honor that was removed from a separate plaza is now on display beneath the portrait, an Army spokesperson said Tuesday.",
      "The items were removed to comply with a Department of Defense directive in 2022 that ordered the academy to address racial injustice and do away with installations that \"commemorate or memorialize the Confederacy.\"",
      "The Pentagon's decision to re-hang the portrait, which shows a Black man leading Lee's horse in the background, was first reported by The New York Times. It had been hanging in the library since the 1950s before it was placed it in storage.",
      "The actions at West Point come as the Trump administration restores Confederate names and monuments that had been removed in recent years.",
      "\"At West Point, the United States Military Academy is prepared to restore historical names, artifacts, and assets to their original form and place,\" Rebecca Hodson, the Army's communications director, said in a prepared statement. \"Under this administration, we honor our history and learn from it - we don't erase it.\"",
      "President Trump issued an executive order in March titled \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\" that decried efforts to reinterpret American history. The Army then restored the names of bases that originally honored Confederate leaders, finding service members with the same surnames to honor.",
      "A commission created by Congress recommended in 2022 that the name and images of Confederate officers be removed from military academies. Lee graduated second in his West Point class in 1829 and later served as superintendent, and his name and image had prominent places at the academy on the Hudson River.",
      "Congress took that action after repeated complaints by current and former enlistees and officers in nearly every branch of the armed services who described a deep-rooted culture of racism and discrimination that stubbornly festers despite repeated efforts to eradicate it.",
      "Ty Seidule, a retired brigadier general who served as vice chair of the commission, said Lee's image shouldn't be on display because he \"chose treason\" and doesn't represent the values taught to cadets at West Point.",
      "\"It is against the motto of 'Duty, Honor, Country,'\" Seidule said. \"Robert E. Lee is the antithesis of that, because his duty and honor was for a rebellious slave republic.\"",
      "Seidule, now a history professor at Hamilton College, also questioned whether the restoration of these symbols at West Point are legal under the federal law that led to their removal.",
      "An Army statement asserts that the law doesn't bar the restoration of Confederacy-related names, symbols, displays, monuments or paraphernalia on military property.",
      "The naming commission said in 2022 that it wasn't created \"with any intention of 'erasing history.'\"",
      "\"The facts of the past remain and the commissioners are confident the history of the Civil War will continue to be taught at all service academies with all the quality and complex detail our national past deserves,\" the commission said at the time. \"Rather, they make these recommendations to affirm West Point's long tradition of educating future generations of America's military leaders to represent the best of our national ideals.\"",

    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014\u00a0China flexed its might and muscle on Wednesday at a military parade in Beijing showcasing its latest missiles, advanced weapons systems and drones. In his address, President Xi Jinping said his nation was \"unstoppable.\"",
      "It was China's biggest military parade ever, meant to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and Japan's formal surrender. But the massive \"Victory Day\" procession down Chang-an Avenue \u2014 the name of which means \"Eternal Peace\" \u2014 carried a much broader message. Standing next to Xi for the parade were Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.",
      "Security in the sprawling Chinese capital was extra tight. All buildings overlooking the parade route were locked down as the leaders and other dignitaries from 26 countries took in the spectacle, along with some 50,000 spectators.",
      "It was a landmark moment for Xi, China's 72-year-old leader. It was the third and most important military parade he has overseen since coming to power in 2012.",
      "As commander-in-chief of the world's largest standing armed forces, he watched smiling as tens of thousands of troops under his orders goose stepped in perfect unison toward Tiananmen Square in central Beijing with the sound of cannons ringing through the air.",
      "It was a visceral display of China's growing military might and newest hardware, including hypersonic weapons, nuclear capable missiles, a new laser weapon, fighter jets and underwater drones. But it also pointedly showed off Beijing's growing clout as a geopolitical power, with deepening ties to some of the United States' most potent adversaries.",
      "The message from the stage, with Xi, Putin and Kim standing shoulder to shoulder, was undeniable: strength in solidarity, and a challenge to the U.S.-dominated world order that has prevailed for a century.",
      "Together, they have\u00a0been dubbed\u00a0an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts, and Xi's decision to bring together the leaders of some of the most\u00a0heavily sanctioned nations\u00a0in the world was clearly calculated. The parade was the first time that Kim had ever appeared together with both Xi and Putin \u2014 offering him a first multilateral diplomatic event.",
      "Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian and the leader of Myanmar's ruling military junta, President Min Aung Hlaing, were also there, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Xi and Putin have made their ambition to shake up the global status quo clear for several years.",
      "\"We, together with you and with our sympathizers, will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\" Russia's longtime Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in 2022, ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "The gathering in Beijing represented a clear challenge to President Trump's claim to be fostering close working relationships with Xi, Putin and Kim.",
      "Mr. Trump had a go at China on social media, saying American soldiers deserve credit for helping China defeat Japanese forces during WWII. He went on to accuse China, Russia and North Korea of conspiring against the U.S., which a Kremlin spokesperson dismissed as possible irony.",
      "Xi's bond with Putin was on clear and deliberate display in the days leading up to the parade, as well.",
      "China and Russia have declared their \"no limits partnership\" and, while China claims to maintain a neutral stance on Russia's war in Ukraine, Beijing's support of the war effort \u2014 by providing dual-use technology and continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas in defiance of Western sanctions, has proven to be an economic lifeline funding Putin's three-and-a-half-year war.",
      "During talks at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday, Putin hailed \"unprecedentedly high relations\" with China and thanked his \"dear friend\" Xi for the warm welcome.",
      "Kim's support for Russia's war has been even more direct. Since October last year, North Korea has sent around 13,000 troops, along with conventional weapons, to support Russia's war effort. South Korea's intelligence services estimate that around 2,000 North Korean troops have been killed fighting alongside Russian forces.",
      "The parade was a show of both China and Russia's implicit support for Kim's nuclear weapons program, which remains the subject of numerous United Nations sanctions.",
      "Xi burnished his credentials as a geopolitical powerbroker at a regional security summit in Tianjin, northern China, that ended on Monday. He hosted more than 20 world leaders there, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "\"We should uphold fairness and justice,\" Xi declared at the gathering of the Shanghai Corporation Organization, seemingly trying to claim moral high ground amid the upheaval and strained relationships caused by Mr. Trump's global trade war and isolationist policies. \"We must oppose the Cold War mentality, block confrontation and bullying practices.\"",
      "Without mentioning the U.S. or its president by name, Xi told the assembled leaders of non-Western countries: \"We must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics.\"",
      "On Monday Xi, Putin and Modi were shown together smiling and laughing at the summit \u2014 a deliberate public display of warmth and camaraderie. Just last week, the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a close ally of Mr. Trump, called the summit \"performative\" and accused China and India of being \"bad actors\" for fueling Russia's war.",
      "At the parade this week, Xi was not only asserting China as a reliable and stable partner, but also showing off his country's burgeoning alliances, influence and military power \u2014 and the potential to back up his vision of a new world order. It was a message that many see as being aimed squarely, if not entirely, at China's rival across the Pacific.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention penned an op-ed Monday condemning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership in the aftermath of the firing of the CDC director last week, claiming he is \"endangering every American's health.\"",
      "\"What the health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has done to the CDC and to our nation's public health system over the past several months \u2014 culminating in his decision to fire Dr. Susan Monarez as CDC director days ago \u2014 is unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency and unlike anything our country had ever experienced,\" the nine former directors and acting directors wrote in the op-ed in The New York Times.",
      "The Trump administration attempted to oust CDC Director Susan Monarez last week, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her firing. Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials have resigned in recent days, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "In their op-ed, the former CDC directors who served under both Democrat and Republican administrations, pointed to a number of decisions by Kennedy that they say are \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" including canceling investments into medical research and the move to replace members on a key vaccine advisory committee, among other things.",
      "\"Firing Dr. Monarez \u2014 which led to the resignations of top CDC officials \u2014 adds considerable fuel to this raging fire,\" the former CDC directors added.",
      "The CDC leaders said they \"applaud Dr. Monarez for standing up for the agency and the health of our communities.\"",
      "\"The loss of Dr. Monarez and other top leaders will make it far more difficult for the CDC to do what it has done for about 80 years: work around the clock to protect Americans from threats to their lives and health,\" they wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, the former CDC directors also called on Congress to exercise its oversight authority over the department of Health and Human Services. The CDC is one of a number of agencies under the HHS umbrella.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on HHS last week\u00a0 to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for Sept. 18 amid the slew of CDC departures. And the Louisiana Republican, who delivered the key vote to advance Kennedy's confirmation as secretary, also said the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "When Cassidy was asked Tuesday evening if he regretted his vote to confirm Kennedy, he said, \"This is about children's health.\"",
      "\"This is about how we protect the children of the United States of America,\" Cassidy continued. \"And there's allegations that that health is being endangered. I'm not presupposing anybody's right or wrong. We got to get to the bottom of it, and it'll take radical transparency. My colleagues agree with that.\"",
      "In an appearance on Fox News last week after the CDC director firing, Kennedy said he wouldn't comment on personnel, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to appear before the Senate Finance Committee Thursday to testify on President Trump's health care agenda.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, says the timing of the op-ed \"has everything to do with Dr. Monarez's firing last week,\" but she added that \"the concerns that they outlined are really about politics and ideology taking precedence over public health and science.\"",
      "Citing the firings of federal health workers across HHS, the weakening of public health programs, questions about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines amid a serious measles outbreak in Texas, among other things, Gounder said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" that \"we really are very concerned about how this is now diminishing trust in the very most basic of public health infrastructure in this country.\"",

      "In recent weeks, President Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves credit for ending six or seven wars during his first months in office, arguing that he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.",
      "\"I stopped seven wars, and they were, they're big ones too,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "\"I've settled six wars, and a lot of people say seven because there's one that nobody knows about,\" he said in an August 19 interview.",
      "A White House official provided a list of seven conflicts the president is referencing: Israel and Iran, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.",
      "\"There has been more progress towards peace than ever before because of this President's leadership,\" the official wrote.",
      "The recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace prize is expected to be announced next month.",
      "Over 100 people have received the award since the 19th-century chemist Alfred Nobel created the prize to honor a \"person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"",
      "Four U.S. presidents have been past laureates, most recently Barack Obama who received the prize for supporting nuclear nonproliferation and international diplomacy.",
      "Foreign policy experts say that while Mr. Trump has helped broker ceasefires, including one between Israel and Iran, several of the foreign conflicts cited by the administration were not full-scale wars \u2014 and many remain unresolved. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification on why the president has repeatedly labeled all seven conflicts as settled wars.",
      "Some of these peace efforts involved limited U.S. involvement, and in other instances, it remains unclear whether Mr. Trump's role was decisive.",
      "Here's a look at the conflicts:",
      "Israel and Iran",
      "After Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities in June, a 12-day conflict resulted in the deaths of about 28 Israelis and hundreds of Iranians before a ceasefire was reached with U.S. and Qatari involvement. Mr. Trump claimed credit, saying he had ordered U.S. airstrikes on Iran's uranium enrichment sites and pressed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold back from further strikes.",
      "Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at Brookings, said Mr. Trump deserves some credit for this ceasefire. \"He managed to use a combination of a good relationship with Netanyahu, but also a willingness to put a little pressure on Netanyahu that I think contributed to the at least temporary cessation of hostilities,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "But other foreign policy experts said tensions between the nations are far from resolved, and Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in early July that the Defense Department estimated the U.S. strikes likely delayed Iran's nuclear program by \"one to two years.\"",
      "Larry Haas, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council said, \"I very strongly disagree with the notion that the president brought peace to Iran and Israel. We may be in a quiet period in terms of direct confrontation, but Iran right now is trying to regroup.\"",
      "Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo",
      "In June, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo announced a\u00a0peace deal after multiple days of talks in Washington mediated by President Trump and Qatar.",
      "The deal aimed to end three decades of fighting over Congo's mineral reserves. Yet the violence has continued, with both sides accusing each other of violating peace terms. Human Rights Watch reported that M23, an armed group that U.S. officials believe is backed by Rwanda, killed over 140 civilians in eastern Congo in July.",
      "\"It's a premature declaration of success, when in fact we are just getting to the starting line,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "Armenia and Azerbaijan",
      "In August, Mr. Trump helped negotiate an agreement aimed at normalizing relations and\u00a0 reopening transportation routes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have spent decades fighting for control of the Karabakh region.",
      "O'Hanlon and Haas agreed the Trump administration pushed the deal forward in part by inviting both leaders to the White House. Leaders of both countries also credited Mr. Trump for the agreement, saying he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "But the deal is not a formal peace agreement and requires ratification. One remaining sticking point is that Azerbaijan wants Armenia to remove any mention of territorial claims to Azerbaijan's land from its constitution before officials sign a final deal.\u00a0 Armenia's prime minister has expressed willingness to change the constitution but has not specified a date for a referendum.",
      "Thailand and Cambodia",
      "In late July, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a ceasefire after an outbreak of fighting killed at least 35 people. President Trump said that he had pressured both sides to come to the table by threatening trade consequences.",
      "The U.S. is a top importer for both counties, and foreign policy experts CBS News spoke to said Mr. Trump's tariff threats played a significant role in securing a ceasefire. \"He helped move things along with economic pressure,\" Haas said.",
      "The border dispute is continuing, though, with Thai officials accusing Cambodia of laying new landmines. Cambodia denied doing so.",
      "India and Pakistan",
      "India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in May after weeks of cross-border missile and drone strikes. The deal ended the latest flare-up in their long-running dispute over Kashmir, which both nuclear-armed nations claim as their territory.",
      "Pakistan credited the Trump administration's efforts in U.S.-led talks, and nominated him for the Nobel Peace prize. But India insisted its own pressure on Pakistan, not U.S. diplomacy, drove the deal.",
      "Josh Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it's a stretch to call the dispute over Kashmir settled.",
      "\"There is no real ending to this conflict,\" he said, noting that future negotiations could be complicated by Mr. Trump's decision to impose steep tariffs on India, a key partner.",
      "Egypt and Ethiopia",
      "Mr. Trump also claims he brokered peace between Ethiopia and Egypt, which have disagreed about Ethiopia's decision to construct a hydroelectric dam in the Nile.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump tried to\u00a0broker a deal between the countries and\u00a0suspended some aid to Ethiopia because of a lack of progress. In June, the president mentioned the dispute on Truth Social, writing, \"There is peace, at least for now, because of my intervention, and it will stay that way!\"",
      "No deals have been announced, however. Ethiopia still plans to officially open its dam in September over Egypt's objections that it will restrict the flow of water to its country. And while Egypt previously threatened to go to war over the dam, this conflict has remained a diplomatic one.",
      "O'Hanlon said of the dispute, \"I would not call the Egypt-Ethiopia interaction a war.\"",
      "Serbia and Kosovo",
      "In 2020, President Trump helped negotiate\u00a0a deal between Serbia and Kosovo to help normalize economic ties, but progress stalled afterward.",
      "Talks have continued with European leaders, but no breakthroughs have emerged. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which Serbia still does not recognize.",
      "\"His deal-making, to the extent that it existed, actually occurred in his first term, and he really hasn't stopped what's going on,\" Haas said.",

Its main goal is to find ways to defend U.S. interests in space. In 2023, President Joe Biden had decided\u00a0instead to keep Space Command headquarters in Colorado, where its temporary headquarters was located, overturning Mr. Trump's first-term decision to move it to Alabama.",
      "Biden had been convinced by the head of Space Command at the time that moving its headquarters would jeopardize military readiness. His reversal prompted the House Armed Services Committee, chaired by Republican Mike Rogers of Alabama, to request the Pentagon's watchdog investigate the basing decision.",
      "The Defense Department inspector general said in a report that Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, would be the Air Force's preferred location for the command, but building facilities equal to the ones that were already in Colorado could take three to four years. According to the IG's report, Army Gen. James Dickinson, then the commander of U.S. Space Command, voiced concerns about the timeline's impact on the command's readiness, which contributed to the decision Biden had made to keep the headquarters in Colorado."

    "story": [
      "A dinosaur dubbed one of the \"strangest\" ever found boasted an elaborate armory of long bony spikes and a tail weapon, according to findings published in the science journal Nature.",
      "Spicomellus, which roamed the Earth 165 million years ago, is the world's oldest ankylosaur, a herbivorous group of dinosaurs known for their tank-like bodies.",
      "Palaeontologists' image of Spicomellus was based on a single rib bone found in Morocco in 2019.",
      "But newly discovered remains have helped scientists form a clearer picture of the unusual dinosaur.",
      "The fossils showed it had bony spikes fused onto all of its ribs \u2014 something never seen before in any other vertebrate species living or extinct, according to the research published Wednesday.",
      "Richard Butler, a professor at the University of Birmingham and the project co-lead, told CBS News partner BBC News that it was the \"punk rocker\" of its time.",
      "Butler called the fossils an \"incredibly significant discovery,\" adding that \"Spicomellus is one of the strangest dinosaurs that we've ever discovered.\"",
      "Butler's project co-leader, Susannah Maidment of the Natural History Museum in London, added that it was surprising that the spikes were fused directly onto the bone, the BBC reported.",
      "\"We don't see that in any other animal, living or extinct,\" she said. \"It's absolutely covered in really weird spikes and protrusions all over the back of the animal, including a bony collar that wraps around its neck and some sort of weapon on the end of its tail, so a most unusual dinosaur.\"",
      "The discovery is so unusual that Butler and Maidment are considering whether the theories on how ankylosaurs evolved should be re-assessed.",
      "These dinosaurs survived late into the time dinosaurs were on Earth, in a period known as the Cretaceous, the BBC reported. The end of this period saw the emergence of large carnivorous predators, such as T. Rex, so it had been thought that ankylosaurs started off with simple, small armored plates on their back, which then became larger and more extensive to protect themselves from these big beasts, according to Butler.",
      "\"If you had asked me what I would have expected the oldest known ankylosaur to look like I would have said something with quite simple armor,\" Butler told BBC News. \"Instead, we have an animal bristling with spikes like a hedgehog, the most bizarre armor that we've ever found in any animal, far outside the range of armor seen in later ankylosaurs.\"",

      "The new facility \u2014 which is located inside the Louisiana State Penitentiary, commonly known as Angola \u2014 is designed to house more than 400 detainees.",
      "The facility was given the name Camp 57 after Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry being the 57th governor of the state. Federal officials have also dubbed Camp 57 as \"Louisiana Lockup.\" In a news release, the Department of Homeland Security described it as part of a \"new partnership\" between the Trump administration and the state of Louisiana.",

      "\"This is not just a typical ICE detention facility that you will see elsewhere in the country,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference Wednesday in front of Camp 57, alongside Bondi and Landry.",
      "She said some of the men who have already transferred there were convicted of serious crimes, including murder and rape.",
      "\"Louisiana is one of several states stepping up to solve these problems,\" Noem said.",
      "Noem also indicated that Angola's \"notorious\" history was one of the reasons that it was chosen for Camp 57.",
      "\"This is a facility that's notorious, it's a facility, Angola Prison is legendary \u2014 but that's a message that these individuals that are going to be here, that are illegal criminals, need to understand,\" Noem told reporters.",

      "Prior to its closure, Camp 57 had been used for disciplinary actions against state prisoners, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the project.",
      "Transferring ICE detainees between facilities isn't new but has increased under the current administration. A CBS News analysis of government data found that more than half of immigrants detained by ICE between Jan. 20, 2025, and July 29, 2025, were transferred to another facility two or more times \u2014 a greater share than during the Biden administration, the first Trump administration or the second Obama administration.",
      "Detainees are also getting shuffled further away during these transfers, CBS News found. Under the current administration, about 61% of detainees who started their stay were transferred more than 100 miles at least once. That's also a higher figure than in past administrations.",
      "Some immigration advocates are concerned this practice could make it more difficult for detainees to contact loved ones or their attorneys.",
      "Asked about the increase in detention transfers and how and when ICE determines someone should be transferred, Noem said Wednesday that \"this specific facility is going to host most dangerous criminal illegal aliens in the country, because it is so secure. Those individuals are being moved from other facilities around the country...because it is so secure behind these fences. I would say that we move people to other facilities for logistics, based on what country they're being repatriated from, where their flights are going, what we need to do to build deficiencies, and we will continue to do that as we need to in order to deport them out of the country and take them back home.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 23:03:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court a lower court decision that found many of his tariffs are unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court late Wednesday to review a federal appeals court decision that found many of his tariffs are illegal, warning that the ruling threatens to \"unilaterally disarm the United States and allow other nations to hold America's economy hostage to their retaliatory trade policies.\"",
      "The appeal from the Justice Department was expected. Mr. Trump said this week that his administration would turn to the high court and ask it to speed up consideration of the case. The case has not yet been docketed by the Supreme Court.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a 7-4 decision last Friday that Mr. Trump did not have the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under a federal emergency powers law, derailing a major component of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. But the appeals court said its ruling will not take effect until at least Oct. 14 to allow the Justice Department time to seek the Supreme Court's review.",
      "The administration wants the Supreme Court to decide whether a federal emergency powers law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, authorizes the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, and whether the law unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority to the president.",
      "It could be weeks before the high court decides whether to weigh in on the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs and, if it decides to do so, months before a decision is handed down.",
      "The president has warned that \"our country is going to suffer greatly\" if the Supreme Court upholds the lower court's decision on the tariffs.",
      "\"The stakes in this case could not be higher. The President and his Cabinet officials have determined that the tariffs are promoting peace and unprecedented economic prosperity, and that the denial of tariff authority would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses and thrust America back to the brink of economic catastrophe,\" the administration said in a filing. \"To the President and his most senior advisors, these tariffs thus present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation.\"",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote the Federal Circuit's ruling jeopardizes framework agreements that the Trump administration has negotiated with a handful of trading partners and puts ongoing talks at risk.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to expedite its review of the case. It proposed that the justices decide whether to take up the issue by next week, with all briefs due by late October and oral arguments in early November \u2014 an unusually fast timeline for the high court. The Justice Department included a statement from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that argued a quick resolution is necessary because the appeals court ruling \"gravely undermines the President's ability to conduct real-world diplomacy.\"",
      "Sauer indicated in the filing that the plaintiffs in the case agreed to the proposed schedule.",
      "Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel of the Liberty Justice Center, which is representing a group of small businesses that challenged the tariffs, said he is confident they will prevail before the Supreme Court.",
      "\"These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival,\" he said in a statement Wednesday. \"We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients.\"",
      "The tariffs at issue in the case include those imposed by Mr. Trump through executive action taken in April that set a 10% baseline rate on nearly every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also involves a set of duties imposed on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "The Federal Circuit upheld a May ruling from the U.S. Court of International Trade that found Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued his tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "But the levies are still in effect despite the Federal Circuit's decision, since it tossed out a permanent injunction issued by the trade court that universally blocked enforcement of the tariffs.",
      "In its unsigned decision, the Federal Circuit said that the right to impose tariffs are a \"core congressional power.\" The majority said in other statutes delegating tariff power to the president, Congress has set \"specific substantive limitations and procedural guidelines\" to be followed when leaving those duties.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has used tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trading partners into negotiations, and said the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. He has announced frameworks of trade deals with countries like the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Wednesday's court filing argued that IEEPA gives the president \"broad discretion\" to regulate trade, including by imposing tariffs.",
      "\"There is nothing new or suspect about IEEPA's broad delegation of tariff authority to address national emergencies,\" Sauer wrote. \"Congress has long supplemented the President's Article II foreign-affairs powers by delegating capacious authority to impose tariffs that, in the President's judgment, will advance national security, foster economic prosperity, or facilitate negotiations with foreign counterparts.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 21:05:24 -0400",
    "summary": "The decision from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs is a massive victory for Harvard University.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration violated Harvard University's First Amendment rights and federal law when it froze nearly $2 billion in federal grants because of the Ivy League school's handling of antisemitism on campus.",
      "In a victory for Harvard, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs blocked Trump administration officials from implementing or instituting orders freezing the grant funding to Harvard and letters terminating research grants awarded by a slew of federal agencies.",
      "Burroughs wrote in her 84-page decision that Harvard has been \"plagued\" by antisemitism in recent years and should have done more to deal with the issue. But she found that there is \"little connection between the research affected by the grant terminations and antisemitism.\"",
      "\"In fact, a review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities, and did so in a way that runs afoul of the APA, the First Amendment and Title VI,\" Burroughs wrote. \"Further, their actions have jeopardized decades of research and the welfare of all those who could stand to benefit from that research, as well as reflect a disregard for the rights protected by the Constitution and federal statutes.\"",
      "The decision is a significant win for Harvard, which has been targeted by the Trump administration in recent months. The administration has sought to punish Harvard over what it says is its failure to condemn antisemitism and protect Jewish students on campus. But it has also criticized the school's hiring and admissions practices.",
      "White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston told CBS News in a statement that the Trump administration will appeal the decision.",
      "\"Just as President Trump correctly predicted on the day of the hearing, this activist Obama-appointed judge was always going to rule in Harvard's favor, regardless of the facts,\" Huston said. \"To any fair-minded observer, it is clear that Harvard University failed to protect their students from harassment and allowed discrimination to plague their campus for years. Harvard does not have a constitutional right to taxpayer dollars and remains ineligible for grants in the future. We will immediately move to appeal this egregious decision, and we are confident we will ultimately prevail in our efforts to hold Harvard accountable.\"",
      "In a statement posted to the university's website Wednesday evening, Harvard President Alan Garber wrote that \"the ruling affirms Harvard's First Amendment and procedural rights, and validates our arguments in defense of the University's academic freedom, critical scientific research, and the core principles of American higher education.\"",
      "The Trump administration sent a letter to Harvard leaders in April that contained a list of demands, and after the university rejected the terms, administration officials announced it had frozen more than $2.2 billion in grants and contracts to Harvard. The school later received letters from nine federal agencies canceling research grants.",
      "The Trump administration's cuts to federal funding to Harvard have continued, and Mr. Trump has also threatened to revoke the school's tax-exempt status.",
      "Harvard sued the Trump administration over the funding freeze in April, claiming the move was part of a \"pressure campaign\" by the White House to \"force Harvard to submit to the government's control over its academic programs,\" and views on anti-Israel speech on its campus. Both Harvard and the Justice Department asked Burroughs to go straight to a decision on the merits of the suit without a trial.",
      "In her ruling, Burroughs called the Trump administration's actions part of a \"government-initiated onslaught\" against the school that was \"much more about promoting a governmental orthodoxy in violation of the First Amendment than about anything else, including fighting antisemitism.\"",
      "\"Harvard is currently, even if belatedly, taking steps it needs to take to combat antisemitism and seems willing to do even more if need be,\" Burroughs wrote. \"Now it is the job of the courts to similarly step up, to act to safeguard academic freedom and freedom of speech as required by the Constitution, and to ensure that important research is not improperly subjected to arbitrary and procedurally infirm grant terminations, even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost.\"",
      "Burroughs said that the Trump administration was right to investigate antisemitic behavior on Harvard's campus, but said that focus was not the \"true aim\" of the funding freeze. Instead, she agreed with Harvard that the administration retaliated against it in violation of its First Amendment rights.",
      "\"Harvard was wrong to tolerate hateful behavior for as long as it did,\" Burroughs wrote. \"The record here, however, does not reflect that fighting antisemitism was Defendants' true aim in acting against Harvard and, even if it were, combating antisemitism cannot be accomplished on the back of the First Amendment.\"",
      "Burroughs said that none of the letters the Trump administration sent to Harvard \"identified any specific instance of antisemitism on Harvard's campus, specified how Harvard failed to respond to any such acts of antisemitism in a way that violated Title VI, or reflected any effort to follow the Title VI procedural requirements that govern the termination of federal funding.\"",
      "In addition to targeting Harvard's federal funding, the Trump administration has also taken aim at its ability to enroll international students. Harvard sued the government over its efforts, and in June, Burroughs\u00a0blocked the Trump administration from revoking the university's ability to enroll foreign students. The Justice Department has appealed that decision.",

      "The wildfire forced the evacuation Tuesday of the Chinese Camp and surrounding highways, according to CalFire, the state's chief fire agency. Other areas were under evacuation warnings. There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries.",
      "The 6-5 Fire was caused by lightning, according to CalFire. It is one of several fires called the TCU September Lightning Complex, which has burned more than 19 square miles in multiple locations in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties as of early Wednesday with no containment.",
      "Thousands of people from China came to California during the Gold Rush and faced persecution that included an exorbitant Foreign Miners Tax designed to drive them away from mining.

    "story": [
      "A man charged in the killing of four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, is now facing additional charges, including attempted arson, officials said Wednesday.",
      "State District Judge Jeffrey Dahood ordered Michael Paul Brown to be held without bail after the defendant's attorneys said mental illness could be an issue in the case.",
      "Brown's family has said the 45-year-old former soldier long struggled with mental illness before allegedly shooting a bartender and three patrons at The Owl Bar in Anaconda on Aug. 1. He evaded capture for a week, while hundreds of law enforcement officers searched for him in the nearby mountains, before being found and taken in on Aug. 8.",
      "Brown, who lived next door to the bar, also tried to damage or destroy the building by lighting objects inside it on fire, according to newly released court documents.",
      "The owner of The Owl Bar, David Gwerder, said Wednesday he was told by investigators that Brown lit a cardboard pizza box on fire hoping to use it as a \"fuse\" to ignite a bucket of flammable or explosive material. But the bucket did not ignite, Gwerder said he was told, and the suspect allegedly left the bar, then returned a minute later with a gun and shot everyone who was there.",
      "Defense attorney Walter Hennessey pleaded not guilty on Brown's behalf to charges that also include four counts of murder, theft and eluding police. Brown appeared by video from jail in Butte, Montana.",
      "His bail had previously been set at $2 million. But Dahood on Wednesday sided with a prosecution request to hold Brown for now without the possibility of bail. The judge cited public safety and the mental health issues raised by Brown's attorneys. A trial is scheduled for Jan. 12, 2026.",
      "Authorities have not commented on a possible motive, and much of the case against Brown has been sealed by the judge.",
      "A conviction for murder, known in Montana as deliberate homicide, can be punishable by death in the state. However, executions in Montana have been on hold since 2015 under a court ruling regarding a drug used in lethal injections.",
      "A decision on whether to seek the death penalty against Brown is pending, Deer Lodge County Attorney Morgan Smith told the court on Wednesday.",
      "Anaconda, about 25 miles northwest of Butte, is home to roughly 9,000 people. It is surrounded by mountains. Following the shooting, Brown allegedly stole a truck that he ditched several miles outside of town at the base of a mountain before escaping into the forest.",
      "He hid for a week in that area west of Anaconda where he was eventually apprehended, moving locations while helicopters and drones circled overhead and officers and dogs searched on the ground, officials said. Brown was captured on Aug. 8 inside an unoccupied structure near a bar in the small community of Stumptown, authorities said.",
      "Investigators have also been examining whether he had any contact with individuals or property owners who might have helped him while he was on the run.",
      "Brown had patronized the bar over several decades and knew the victims, Gwerder said.",

    "story": [
      "A judge on Wednesday sentenced four former Milwaukee hotel workers accused of killing a man in a suffocating dogpile to a mix of probation and time served, sparing them any more time behind bars.",
      "Milwaukee County Circuit Judge David Swanson handed down the sentences in D'Vontaye Mitchell's June 2024 death during a series of hearings that lasted all day. The orders bring an end to a case that drew comparisons to the 2020 police killing of George Floyd.",
      "The judge ordered former Hyatt security guard Todd Erickson to serve two years in prison but stayed the sentence and placed him on probation for two years. Another former security guard, Brandon Turner, got a year in prison, but Swanson stayed that sentence, too, and placed him on probation for a year.",
      "Former bellhop Herbert Williamson was sentenced to 10 days in jail with credit for 10 days already served. Former front desk worker Devin Johnson-Carson was ordered to serve four days in jail with credit for four days already served.",
      "Attorneys for Erickson, Turner and Williamson didn't immediately return messages. Johnson-Carson's attorney, Craig Robert Johnson, said in an email to The Associated Press that the sentence was appropriate given that Johnson-Carson was trying to protect hotel guests and staff and never intended to seriously injure Mitchell.",
      "According to investigators, Mitchell ran into the Hyatt's lobby and went into the women's bathroom. Two women later told detectives that Mitchell tried to lock them in the bathroom. The women told police that Mitchell had entered the bathroom frantically, seemingly to run from the security guard, and appeared to be trying to lock the bathroom door to keep the guard out.",
      "Turner pulled Mitchell out of the bathroom and together with a guest dragged him out of the lobby onto a hotel driveway. Turner, Erickson, Williamson and Johnson-Carson struggled with Mitchell before taking him to the ground and piling on top of him.",
      "Hotel surveillance video shows Johnson-Carson holding Mitchell's legs while Erickson, Turner and Williamson held down his upper body. They kept him pinned for eight to nine minutes. By the time emergency responders arrived, Mitchell had stopped breathing.",
      "A medical examiner ruled his death a homicide, finding that Mitchell's immediate cause of death was suffocation and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine.",
      "Prosecutors initially charged\u00a0all four employees\u00a0with being a party to felony murder. Turner and Erickson both pleaded guilty to that count. Williamson and Johnson-Carson pleaded guilty to a reduced count of misdemeanor battery.",
      "Attorneys for Mitchell's family likened his death to the murder of Floyd, a Black man who died after a White Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for about nine minutes. Floyd's death sparked a national reckoning on racial relations.",
      "\"The fact that D'Vontaye was held face down on the pavement for eight to nine minutes \u2013\u2013 just like George Floyd \u2013\u2013 is a sobering reminder of the urgent need for accountability and justice,\" family attorney Benjamin Crump said after the incident.",
      "Mitchell was Black. Court records identify Erickson as White and Turner, Williamson and Johnson-Carson as Black.",
      "The workers told investigators that Mitchell was strong and tried to bite Erickson, but they didn't mean to hurt him. Johnson-Carson, Erickson, Turner and Williamson were fired from their positions at the Hyatt Regency, said Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the hotel and employs its staff.",

      "Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday the federal government has \"no immediate plans\" to send National Guard forces to Chicago, one day after President Trump again suggested he will send federal forces to the nation's third-largest city \u2014 drawing criticism from local leaders.",
      "The president had told reporters\u00a0Tuesday that \"we're going in\" to Chicago, but \"I didn't say when.\" The comments came weeks after Mr. Trump deployed Guard forces to the streets of Washington, D.C., as part of a controversial anti-crime push, and suggested during that time that Chicago could be next.",
      "Asked by reporters for details on a possible Guard deployment in Chicago, Vance deferred to Mr. Trump on Wednesday, before saying: \"There are no immediate plans, but the president has said he has the legal authority to protect American citizens, whether that's in Chicago or in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Vance said the Trump administration hopes to work with Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, echoing the president, who said Tuesday he wants Pritzker to request that military forces be sent to Chicago to quell violent crime.",
      "Pritzker called the president's comments \"unhinged\" and vowed to take legal action against any potential military deployment. He argued that there isn't an emergency that would justify sending troops to Chicago, citing city statistics that show violent crime is on the decline.",
      "According to Department of Homeland Security sources, the Trump administration is also planning a major expansion of immigration enforcement operations in Chicago as early as this week, CBS News has reported.",
      "If Guard forces are sent to Chicago, it could become the third major U.S. city to face a military deployment under Mr. Trump's orders. Other cities could follow: Mr. Trump suggested Tuesday he's also planning to take action in Baltimore, and he said Wednesday he's weighing a deployment in New Orleans.",
      "Thousands of California National Guard forces were sent to Los Angeles starting in June, part of a mission to protect federal immigration agents and property from what Mr. Trump described as out-of-control, violent protests. And last month, the president sent members of the D.C. National Guard and federal law enforcement agents to the streets of the nation's capital.",
      "The potential move could draw legal challenges in Chicago. California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration over the Los Angeles deployment, arguing the federal government didn't have the legal right to take control of the state's Guard forces and alleging the troops were unlawfully engaged in law enforcement.",
      "An appellate court allowed Mr. Trump to keep Guard forces in Los Angeles, deferring to Mr. Trump. But a district court judge found Tuesday that the deployment violated a 19th-century law that prohibits the military from being used for law enforcement.",

Neither the 911 caller, dispatch, nor the officers were aware of Perez's age or his disabilities. Instead, the officers were told they were heading into a disturbance where an intoxicated male was trying to stab others with a knife,\" the letter states.",
      "Officers were called to Perez's home on April 5 by a neighbor, who saw the teen holding a knife and in an altercation with members of his family in their backyard. When officers arrived, they moved to a 4-foot chain-link fence around the backyard. Perez, who also had cerebral palsy, had fallen over and was on the ground when officers arrived. Guns drawn, they repeatedly yelled, \"Drop the knife!\" but he instead stood up and began to step toward them. Three officers opened fire with their handguns, while a fourth fired a bean-bag shotgun, officials have previously said.",

      "The letter also notes that Idaho law \"does not require officers to use less lethal options or to retreat when deadly force is justified.\" It also does not require police to try a Taser or other less-lethal tools before using deadly force.",

      "He wrote that the situation is \"tragic and heart-rending,\" and that if officers had known more at the time, \"our conclusions might be different.\" But, he added, prosecutors must base decisions \"only on what the officers actually knew or reasonably believed at the time,\" and on the law.",

      "On Jan. 7, 2007, Linda Stermer says she was doing laundry in the basement of her family's Michigan home when she heard her husband Todd Stermer let out a chilling scream and ran upstairs to find their living room engulfed in flames. Todd Stermer, says Linda, was in the middle of the room attempting to fight the fire. Unable to get to him, she says she fled the burning house with no shoes, jacket or cellphone.",
      "In an interview for \"48 Hours,\" correspondent Erin Moriarty asks Linda Stermer, \"You didn't think about calling 911?\" \"That wasn't my first thought,\" Linda Stermer replies. \u00a0\"My first thought was to get out. Todd's gonna get out \u2026 As long as he knows I'm out \u2026 he's gonna get out.\"\u00a0 Watch more of their interview in an encore of\u00a0\"The Death of Todd Stermer\"\u00a0airing Saturday, Sept. 6 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "The Stermer home was in a rural area outside Kalamazoo, Michigan, with an electrified fence surrounding the large property to help keep the couple's 31 horses safe. Without a cellphone, Linda Stermer says the only way for her to get help that day was to jump into her husband's van, which always had the keys inside, and drive to the nearest neighbor. But just as she was about to take off in the van, she says she saw that her husband had escaped the burning house, and that she got out of the van to help him. \"He's jumping around and he's patting himself. His skin is burnt terribly \u2026 I'm screaming at him, get in the van ... And he won't get in the van,\" Linda Stermer tells Moriarty. \"I can't touch him \u2026 And, so, I get back in the van \u2026 And I lost sight of him.\"",
      "According to weather reports for that day, there was some light rain and snow in the area. Linda Stermer says their driveway was so wet and muddy that it was hard for her to get the van moving. \"The tires were just spinning \u2026 so I couldn't get any traction,\" she says \u2014 but what happened next is something she still cannot explain. \"Did you know you had run over your husband,\" asks Moriarty. \"No,\" says Linda Stermer. Investigators would later find Todd's blood on the van's front bumper and undercarriage. Linda Stermer had hit her husband with his own van.",
      "Emergency workers tried to save Todd Stermer, but he died on the scene from his burn injuries. Van Buren County sheriff's detectives investigated the fire and Todd's death for a little over two years. Then, on June 5, 2009, the prosecutor's office felt it had enough evidence to arrest Linda Stermer and charge her with arson and the murder of her husband. Linda Stermer maintains she is innocent, but the couple's sons say that over time they came to feel that their mother was guilty.",
      "\"What do you believe happened,\" Moriarty asks 28-year-old Trevor Stermer.",
      "\"Our mother murdered our father,\" he replies. \"She set the house on fire, doused him in gasoline, then after the fact when he managed to get out of the house, she ran him over with her van.\"",
      "The evidence presented at trial was mainly circumstantial. Among other things, a gas station clerk testified that she saw Linda Stermer on the morning of the fire seemingly pumping gas into a gas can at the back of her SUV. Her sons testified that when Linda got home from the gas station, she woke them and gave them money to go to the movies. A former close friend testified that Linda Stermer had talked about wanting to kill Todd Stermer by running him over, and accused Linda of having an affair with a coworker.",
      "Linda Stermer's defense countered with testimony from the brother of that former friend, who told the jury that his sister has a history of psychiatric illness and cannot be trusted.\u00a0 As for pumping gas into a can that morning, Linda Stermersays it was cold out and she went to the back of her SUV to get gloves to pump gas into her car. Nothing more. She also insists that the reason she sent her sons to the movies that day is that she and Todd were in the throes of a heated argument. She was planning on leaving Todd that day, says Linda, and did not want her sons there to see it.",
      "On Jan. 13, 2010, the jury convicted Linda Stermer. A month later, she was sentenced to life in prison without parole \u2014 but after serving nearly 9 years, she was once again free, at least temporarily.",
      "Erin Moriarty and I first met Linda Stermer and her new attorney Wolfgang Mueller at the 2019 Innocence Network Conference. A federal judge had overturned Linda's conviction in December \u00a02018 and set her free. Judge Arthur J. Tarnow declared that Linda did not get a fair trial and said he found prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel.",
      "The State of Michigan immediately filed an appeal to reinstate Linda's conviction and put her back behind bars. Prosecutors declared that if they lost, they would retry her.",
      "On May 15, 2020, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Linda Stermer and upheld Judge Tarnow's decision to overturn her conviction. But prosecutors with the Van Buren County Prosecutor's Office decided to try her a second time.",
      "In May 2025, Linda Stermer was retried and found guilty. of murder. Sher was\u00a0sentenced to life in prison\u00a0without the possibility of parole.",
      "In a family divided, Linda' Stermer's sons vow they will never speak to her again. Their half-sisters \u2014 Linda's daughters from a previous marriage,\u00a0 still believe their mother is innocent and hope that she is once again released on appeal.",

      "More than 1,000 current and former Health and Human Services employees penned an open letter Wednesday calling for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to either resign or be fired.",
      "The letter \u2014 whose signatories were not publicly named \u2014 was released at a tense time for the health agency. Last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired, and several other top CDC officials resigned from their jobs in protest. Staff are also reeling from layoffs, changes to the vaccine approval system \u2014 led by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 and a shooting outside the CDC headquarters last month.",
      "Wednesday's letter accused Kennedy of \"endangering the nation's health.\" It cited last week's upheaval at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to rescind emergency approvals that made the COVID-19 vaccines available for young children, and the elevation of \"political ideologues who pose as scientific experts\" to key vaccine approval posts.",
      "It called for Kennedy to resign, and said that if he declines to leave his post voluntarily, President Trump should pick a new HHS secretary.",
      "\"We swore an oath to support and defend the United States Constitution and to serve the American people. Our oath requires us to speak out when the Constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,\" the letter reads.",
      "The letter was released by a group called Save HHS, which penned a similar open letter last month urging Kennedy to \"stop spreading inaccurate health information.\"",
      "The group said the signatories for Wednesday's letter were provided to members of Congress, but weren't publicly listed due to security and privacy concerns.",
      "HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon responded to the letter by defending Kennedy's record and arguing he is working to restore trust in a \"broken\" CDC.",
      "\"From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door \u2014 and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\" Nixon said. \"That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Separately, nine former CDC directors wrote a New York Times op-ed on Monday that castigated Kennedy for making decisions they said were \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" and argued Monarez's firing \"adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday morning, where he's likely to face questions about the tumult at HHS.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed that Monarez was fired. Her lawyers called the firing \"legally deficient\" and said she was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",
      "At least four other senior CDC leaders also stepped down last week, in some cases penning resignation letters that decried cuts to the CDC, accused the Trump administration of an \"ongoing weaponizing of public health\" and blasted \"misinformation\" about vaccines.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee, said the resignations will \"require oversight.\" He also sits on the Senate Finance Committee.",

      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Defense Department is considering authorizing up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges, a defense official confirmed.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that at the request of the Justice Department, the Defense Department is in the process of \"identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve as Temporary Immigration Judges.\"",
      "Parnell said the Defense Department attorneys would help with the backlog of cases \"by presiding over immigration hearings.\" The Associated Press first reported the Pentagon's plans.",
      "The immigration courts are struggling with a backlog of more than 3.4 million cases. But the plan to turn possibly hundreds of military lawyers into immigration judges comes after the Trump administration has fired more than two dozen immigration judges nationwide so far this year. Unlike federal district court judges, immigration judges work for the Justice Department.",
      "Judge Advocate General Corps officers are tasked with providing legal support to service members and their families or advising commanders on the legalities of warfare. The defense lawyers would likely need to undergo some training in immigration law, procedure and policy.",
      "The Trump administration loosened the job requirements for temporary immigration judges last month, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to handle cases in immigration court. Its new rule, published in the Federal Register in late August, states that the Justice Department \"no longer believes the restriction of [temporary immigration judges] to current Department employees with a threshold level of immigration law experience serves [the Executive Office for Immigration Review's] interests.\"",
      "Previously, only Justice Department lawyers with a decade of immigration law experience or former immigration judges could fill those roles.",
      "The American Immigration Lawyers Association criticized the plan in a statement after the new rule was published.",
      "\"While DoD attorneys may be well suited to handle military matters, immigration law is entirely different and exceptionally complex,\" AILA said. \"It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement.\"",
      "\"The work of immigration judges has been described as life and death decisions in traffic court conditions,\" the statement continued. \"Expecting fair decisions from judges unfamiliar with the law is absurd. This reckless move guts due process and further undermines the integrity of our immigration court system.\"",
      "The group called on Congress to use its oversight powers \"to defend the rule of law and protect the independence of the immigration judiciary.\"",
      "In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has already proposed loaning National Guard troops to the federal government for use as immigration judges. He said in May that his office had submitted a proposal to the Trump administration that would activate the nine Florida National Guard members who are Judge Advocate General Corps officers to serve as immigration judges, which legal experts told CBS News is unprecedented.",
      "Typically, when National Guard troops help after a hurricane or secure a protest site, they remain under the command of their state governor, under Title 32 of the U.S. Code. Under DeSantis' plan, the state would relinquish control of these officers to Washington. Title 10 would snap into place, reassigning the JAG officers under the command of the president and defense secretary. This grants them eligibility to serve as federal immigration judges, appointed by the U.S. attorney general.",
      "The Justice Department will pick up the tab for the operation if adopted. It plans to train the officers over six weeks \u2014 a crash course in immigration law, procedure and policy. Each officer would need to pass a written exam before donning the judge's robe.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to rein in spending this holiday season by the most amount since the pandemic, as they continue to face pressure from high prices and tariffs.",
      "That's according to a new survey released by accounting firm PwC on Wednesday, which predicts Americans this year will reduce holiday spending to $1,552 a person on average, which is 5% less than in 2024. That includes spending on gifts, travel, food and entertainment.",
      "If the predictions come to pass, it would represent the most significant drop in holiday spending since 2020. While consumers are not cutting purchases entirely, they are getting smarter about how they stretch their dollars, according to Alison Furman, PwC's consumer markets industry leader.",
      "\"Inflation is kind of creeping in, and they're seeing it affect their wallets,\" Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For its report, PwC surveyed 4,000 Americans from Gen Zs to baby boomers over a two-week period from June to July, when tariff-related uncertainty was more pronounced. But any perceived changes in the economy over the next couple of months could alter consumers' attitude toward spending.",
      "\"Economic signals continue to shift and, between now and December, purchasing behavior could evolve in response,\" the report states.",
      "The generation expected to tighten their spending the most is Gen Z. Respondents from this cohort, ages 17 to 28, said they expect to reduce their holiday budgets by 23% \u2014 more than any other generation in the study. That's due in part to the\u00a0tough job market\u00a0facing young Americans, along with rising costs.",
      "Overall, 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending in general over the next six months, according to the report.",
      "A slowdown in spending could spell trouble for retailers who depend on holiday sales to shore up revenue toward the end of the year. Since 2019, holiday sales during the months of November and December have accounted for 19% of total retail revenue for the year, according to a National Retail Federation\u00a0report.",
      "Tariffs, high prices top of mind",
      "The projected pullback in consumer holiday spending underscores Americans' shaky confidence in the state of the economy. Worries over inflation and tariffs have already led shoppers to be more judicious with their spending.",
      "Discretionary spending on categories like indoor and outdoor dining were down in August, according to the U.S. Conference Board's latest consumer confidence index each month. Meanwhile, average 12-month inflation expectations among consumers increased to 6.2%, from 5.7% in July.",

      "With deals in mind, consumers are expected to do a large portion, or 39%, of their total planned holiday gift spending, during the time between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the PwC report. With heightened traffic expected during that five-day stretch, Furman advises shoppers to start looking early for popular items.",
      "\"If you're interested in very hot items, knowing that they're going to likely be on shelves sooner, to guarantee that you'll get them, you may want to shop for them in those early promotional cycles, versus wait until the five-day frenzy,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Wasted energy is a hidden drain on household electricity but small steps can contribute significantly to lowering costs and emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\"Phantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they've improved over time,\" said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\"The good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\" said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\"Just take a little step of unplugging the things that you're not using,\" said Charron. \"It will save you money and it'll save emissions in the long run.\"",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\"Do you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you're not using it?\" said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",
      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you're not using that could be draining energy help, too. For example, smart televisions often have optional features that can be turned off so the television isn't listening for signals from other devices while in standby mode.",
      "\"If you're not using it, then you're getting no benefit, yet you're paying the price and increased the energy use,\" said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"The question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\" said Gilligan. \"Phantom power is one part of this.\"",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don't want to feel like they're being irresponsible.",
      "\"This is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\" said Giligan.",
      "When it comes to daily choices, individuals may think what they're doing isn't really making a big difference. But what they tend to overlook is how they influence others around them by choosing to live a more sustainable life.",

      "\"Not only have I never heard of this happening, I've never heard of a prosecutor who's heard of this happening,\" said former federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou, who served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for in D.C. until January 2025.",
      "\"This is not the fault of career prosecutors, but rather the office's failure\u2014again and again\u2014to secure indictments suggests that the administration has absolutely destroyed its credibility with jurors,\" Ballou told CBS News.",
      "Another former federal prosecutor, Victor Salgado, said, \"It is exceptionally rare for federal grand juries to reject proposed charges, given the low evidentiary bar for indictment and the Justice Department's policy of pursuing cases only when there is sufficient evidence to both secure and sustain a conviction.\"",

      "In a statement to CBS News, D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said, \"A Washington D.C. grand jury refused to indict someone who threatened to kill the President of the United States. Her intent was clear, traveling through five states to do so. She even confirmed the same to the US Secret Service. This is the essence of a politicized jury. The system here is broken on many levels. Instead of the outrage that should be engendered by a specific threat to kill the president, the grand jury in DC refuses to even let the judicial process begin.\"",
      "Jones was briefly held in pretrial detention in the case last month but was released ahead of Tuesday's hearing. She appeared by Zoom at the hearing in Upadhyaya's courtroom and listened as a prosecutor told the judge that the feds have not decided whether to return to the grand jury for a second time to seek an indictment.",
      "Her attorney argued in a court filing this week that Jones possessed no firearms and \"she repeatedly told them she had no intent to harm anyone, including the president, and was in D.C., to attend a peaceful protest.\"",
      "In a separate case, multiple people familiar with the decision said a grand jury refused a Justice Department request to indict Sean Dunn, who was accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent in August. Dunn is a former Justice Department employee who was fired after news circulated of his arrest in the sandwich case. The Justice Department has instead filed a new misdemeanor count against Dunn, which does not require a grand jury indictment.",
      "Court records reviewed by CBS News said a D.C. grand jury also rejected a Justice Department request to indict Sydney Reid, who was arrested in July for allegedly attempting to interfere with the transfer of an alleged gang member into immigration custody.",
      "\"As Reid tried to impede the transfer, one of the (officers) pushed her against the wall and told her to stop,\" the Justice Department alleged in a complaint. \"Reid continued to struggle and fight with the officer.\"",
      "The Justice Department acknowledged in a court filing on Aug. 25 in Reid's case that \"[a]n Indictment has not been returned.\"",
      "Last week, a D.C. grand jury also declined to indict Alvin Summers, who was accused of swinging his arms at a U.S. Park Police officer after a foot chase on Aug. 15. Prosecutors alleged Summers \"grabbed\" the officer with force, and charged him with assaulting and resisting an officer.",
      "Shortly after the grand jury rejected the case, a defense attorney for Summers filed a motion in court, which argued, \"Mr. Summers should not be forced to live under the threat of later charges and rearrest. The charges against Mr. Summers were based on an allegation made by one officer who was wearing a body-worn camera. That officer's testimony was rejected by the grand jury, presumably after reviewing the body-worn camera video.\"",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss Summers's case on Aug. 29.",
      "The trajectory of Jones' case was less clear after Tuesday's hearing. Upadhyaya scheduled a hearing for Monday, but declined Jones' request to loosen the restrictions governing her release from pretrial detention.",
      "The reasons these D.C. grand juries have not handed up indictments in these cases are not known, but Salgado suggested it might be possible that in each of these cases \"that they disagreed with the Justice Department's theory of prosecution.\"",
      "\"It is not difficult to imagine 12 D.C. jurors concluding that throwing a sandwich at a federal officer \u2014 while clearly objectionable and potentially unlawful \u2014 does not amount to felony assault,\" Salgado said. \"At its core, the federal grand jury functions as a vital constitutional safeguard and a critical check on prosecutorial discretion, as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\"",

      "The medical helicopter spotted the downed aircraft after its crew was asked to fly over the area in Bighorn National Forest. Rescue teams set up a command post at a parking lot off a nearby highway, U.S. 14, the Sheridan County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Tuesday.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump told CBS News on Wednesday that he remains committed to pursuing a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, despite mounting uncertainty over the prospect of face-to-face talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Mr. Trump characterized his position as both realistic and optimistic, and said he is closely monitoring how both leaders are handling this crossroads in the negotiations.",
      "\"I've been watching it, I've been seeing it, and I've been talking about it with President Putin and President Zelenskyy,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview. \"Something is going to happen, but they are not ready yet. But something is going to happen. We are going to get it done.\"",
      "The president's comments come as Russia continues to strike Ukraine. Late last month, Russia carried out a massive drone and missile attack against Ukraine's capital, killing at least 15 people, including four children, according to a city official.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is unhappy with the carnage but will keep pushing for a peace agreement.",
      "\"I think we're going to get it all straightened out,\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, the Russia one, I thought, would have been on the easier side of the ones I've stopped, but it seems to be something that's a little bit more difficult than some of the others,\" he said.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that he was watching as Putin joined the leaders of China and North Korea for a grand military parade in Beijing.",
      "\"I understand the reason they were doing it, and they were hoping I was watching, and I was watching,\" Mr. Trump said. \"My relationship with all of them is very good. We're going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also told CBS News on Wednesday that his approach to many diplomatic negotiations, be it with Russia and Ukraine or with other warring nations, is to bring together key leaders into a room and have them broker an agreement in real time, often with his guidance on the transaction \u2014 and to not write off any possibility before that happens.",
      "That approach, he said, demands patience, even when a quick resolution is sought, but he believes it has paid off in other peace agreements this year.",
      "When asked whether he sometimes must \"wait things out,\" Mr. Trump replied, \"Well, you have to do that.\"",
      "\"We've had some very good days, fortunately, and once I get them in a room together, or get them at least speaking together, they seem to work out. We've saved millions of lives.\"",
      "Last month, ahead of his closely watched meeting with Putin in Alaska, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"All I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly.\"",
      "Beyond the Russia-Ukraine war, Mr. Trump has claimed in recent weeks that he should be credited for ending six or seven wars during this term and that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. White House officials have pointed to a list of seven conflicts the president is referencing: Israel and Iran, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.",
      "Some foreign policy analysts have criticized Mr. Trump's claim, saying that many of those conflicts remain unresolved or were not full-scale wars. Or they contended that Mr. Trump was not a central force in the discussions.",
      "Several Trump allies have told CBS News that Mr. Trump maintains that the work done by him and his administration has been crucial in furthering those negotiations.",
      "\"A lot of times, they're fighting each other for so long,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News. \"They're fighting each other so long, they don't even think in terms of peace. It just becomes a way of life. And when I get them together, I get the people in the room, I'm able to convince them. 'Let's go. Let's make peace. It's enough, already. You've lost enough lives.'\"",

    "story": [
      "An Argentine federal court announced Wednesday that authorities had recovered the long-lost \"Portrait of a Lady,\" an 18th-century work by the Italian painter Giuseppe Ghislandi that was looted by the Nazis in World War II and rediscovered when it appeared in an online real estate listing last month.",
      "Before the presentation of the giant gold-framed portrait on Wednesday in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata, the painting had not been seen publicly in 80 years.",
      "The first-ever color photo of the portrait surfaced in a real estate listing unwittingly posted by one of the daughters of Friedrich Kadgien, the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing the painting from one of Europe's most prominent prewar art dealers and collectors.",
      "\"We're doing this simply so that the community to whom we partly owe the discovery of the work ... can see these images,\" federal prosecutor Daniel Adler said during a press conference to display the full-length portrait of Countess Colleoni, her hair ink-black and dress embroidered with pastel flowers.",
      "\"It was people from the community, specifically journalists, who prompted the investigation,\" Adler said.",
      "Dutch journalists made the shocking discovery while investigating Kadgien's past in Argentina, where the high-ranking official fled after the collapse of the Third Reich, and later died in 1978.",
      "News of the find thrilled historians the world over and eventually reached the heirs of the painting's original owner, Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker. He died in a shipwreck after fleeing Amsterdam ahead of advancing German troops in May 1940.",
      "His descendants have sought to recover an estimated 1,100 paintings missing since the forced sale of Goudstikker's extensive inventory to Adolf Hitler's right-hand man, Hermann G\u00f6ring, who built up a major art collection during WWII.",
      "The sudden reappearance of \"Portrait of a Lady\" last week was fleeting. Within hours of the story's publication in Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad last Monday, the real estate listing was taken down. Police raided the rustic Mar del Plata home of Patricia Kadgien, the Nazi officer's daughter, but the painting wasn't there.",
      "Authorities earlier this week raided other homes belonging to the Kadgien sisters in Mar del Plata, seizing paintings and engravings that they similarly suspected of having been stolen during the 1940s.",
      "Argentina's federal prosecutor's office placed Patricia Kadgien and her husband under house arrest pending a hearing Thursday on charges of concealment and obstruction of justice.",
      "Adler, the prosecutor, told reporters that the couple's lawyer had handed over the painting to authorities earlier Wednesday. He did not specify where the portrait would go next.",
      "An art expert invited to assist with the investigation, Ariel Bassano, said the painting was being \"stored in a special chamber\" for safekeeping.",
      "\"It's in good condition given its age,\" Bassano said, dating the portrait to 1710 and valuing it at roughly $50,000.",
      "It's not clear exactly how the painting came into the possession of Kadgien, who worked as a financial adviser to G\u00f6ring.",

      "Drones, AI and lasers",
      "China's LY-1 laser weapon was displayed during the parade for the first time, mounted on top of armored trucks. Defense analyst Alexander Neill told the BBC that the powerful device is believed to have the ability to disable electronics or blind pilots.",
      "There were a number of conventional drones on display, as well as some AI-powered ones.",
      "One that drew particular attention was the AJX002 giant submarine drone, which measures approximately 65 feet long.",
      "Also known as an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle, it could carry out reconnaissance or surveillance missions.",
      "China also showed off stealth attack drones in the parade, including the GJ-11, which is capable of flying alongside manned fighter jets and aiding them in their missions.",
      "\"Robotic wolves\" were also on display. Experts say the four-legged, walking robots could be used for numerous operations, such as sweeping for mines, reconnaissance missions or hunting down enemy troops.",
      "New nuclear-capable, long-range missiles",
      "A new version of China's Dongfeng-5 nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-5C, was unveiled for the parade. It is said to have a longer range than previous variants, Neill told the BBC. He said the missile can also carry up to 12 warheads on a single mission.",
      "The new missile is silo-based, launched from underground facilities, and is meant to be a strategic deterrent, Neill said.",
      "According to The Associated Press, the DF-5C has an estimated range of about 12,400 miles, which makes it easily capable of reaching any part of the United States from mainland China.",
      "A number of other nuclear-capable missiles were rolled down central Beijing's Chang-an (\"Eternal Peace\") Avenue, including the DF-61. Like the DF-5C, it is an intercontinental ballistic missile, but the DF-61 can be fired from a mobile launcher. Little is known about the new weapon, but the previous model has a range of more than 7,500 miles, and it can also carry multiple warheads.",
      "The AP said China's parade also featured the JL-1 and JL-3 nuclear-capable long-range missiles, the first of which is launched from aircraft and the second from vessels at sea.",
      "China wants to \"replace traditional structures\"",
      "\"China not only wants to augment, but replace traditional structures,\" defense analyst Michael Raska told CBS News partner network BBC News, adding that it seems to have taken lessons from Russia's war in Ukraine, where a strategy has been to \"throw drones at the enemy\" to wear down their defenses.",
      "While some countries are concerned about incorporating artificial intelligence into their military systems, China appears to be plowing ahead and \"believe they can control AI,\" Raska told the BBC. \"They are going all the way to integrate it into their systems.\"",
      "The parade showed that China has the resources to build up a significant arsenal, but Raska said the U.S. still maintains the edge operationally.",
      "The U.S. is more agile in battle because it has a \"bottom-up\" culture, where decisions can be made and adapted on the ground in response to evolving situations, Raska said. China, on the other hand, \"can have flashy platforms and systems but they will not move a finger until they receive an order from the top,\" Raska told the BBC.",
      "\"The Chinese think it's technology that creates deterrence. They believe that will deter the U.S.... but at the operational level, there have been instances which show they may not be as good as they say they are,\" Raska said.",

The Glennon participated in D-Day on June 6, 1944. Two days after the invasion, it struck an underwater mine off the coast of France. The ship became trapped and could not be towed to safety before it was struck by a German artillery barrage on June 10.",

Mullaney was declared non-recoverable in May 1949, just under five years after the ship's sinking. His name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at Cambridge American Cemetery in England. He was awarded the Purple Heart, according to an obituary published in late August.",
      "After World War II ended in 1945, the American Graves Registration Command began efforts to recover missing American service members who had died during in combat.

A local resident found human remains in a large section of wreckage from the front portion of the ship, the DPAA said.

Efforts to identify the remains failed, and they were interred at the Ardennes American Cemetery in Belgium in March 1959.",

      "When North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un stepped off his armored train in Beijing to attend celebrations marking 80 years since the end of WWII in Asia, his young daughter Kim Ju Ae surprised the cameras as she appeared then followed alongside him. Believed to be 12 or 13 years old and referred to as \"beloved child\" in North Korean state media, this was her first known trip outside the country.",
      "To casual observers, Kim Ju Ae's appearance Tuesday might be seen as a father-daughter bonding trip. But her arrival in China could be more than that: Kim Jong Un's signal that she is in the mix for future succession plans.",
      "\"Because when North Korea finalizes their successor process, they are used to bringing this successor to China,\" said Park Won-gon, professor of North Korean Studies at Ewha Womans University and director of the Institute of Unification Studies in Seoul. \"Showing them is kind of their tradition.\"",
      "Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, brought him to Beijing to present him as a successor when he was believed to be in his mid-20s. Kim Il Sung, the country's founder, did the same for his son Kim Jong Il. The intent was to begin building the next political relationship with Beijing for the future.",
      "In recent years, Kim Ju Ae has appeared with her father at major public events inside North Korea.",
      "One challenge, however, is that Kim Ju Ae is female, and North Korea is a patriarchal society.",
      "\"We are not 100% because Kim Ju Ae is simply a 13-year-old girl and not an adult at all. So it's too early to say that she's (absolutely) going to be the next successor,\" said Park, \"and Kim Ju Ae doesn't have any kind of military experience.\"",
      "As for Kim Jong Un's trip itself, his visit to Beijing is a huge political win on the world stage with his choreographed proximity to China's President Xi Jinping as proof. The two walked stride-by-stride before China's spectacle of a parade then sat side-by-side, and front-and center, over Tiananmen Square as Chinese troops goose-stepped and as new Chinese military hardware rolled down the Avenue of Eternal Peace.",
      "Xi could have picked any leader of the more than two dozen who traveled in for the commemoration \u2014 including Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, Myanmar's military junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. But it was Kim on his left, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin on his right. And these optics were designed to send a message of unity \u2014 and against Washington and the proverbial West.",
      "\"It's definitely Kim Jong Un's political victory,\" said Park. Xi \"picked Kim Jong Un as the top role and then he is showing his affection to North Korean Kim Jong Un to the world.\"",
      "Kim's biggest win, says Park, is the \"normalized relationship between North Korea and China\" after six years of no face-to-face contact. \"And it will help North Korea in future discussion or dialog with President Trump.

    "summary": "London's police chief says officers shouldn't be \"policing toxic culture wars\" amid an uproar over the arrest of a TV comedy writer for anti-transgender social media posts.",
    "story": [
      "London's police chief has appealed for change, arguing that his officers are in an \"impossible position\" as they try to navigate the evolving landscape of online free speech while enforcing existing laws that bar threats and incitement to violence. The Metropolitan Police chief has called on Britain's government to \"change or clarify\" the relevant laws after the controversial arrest of Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan over anti-transgender social media posts.",
      "Linehan, who co-created the popular 1990s British sitcom \"Father Ted\" and wrote and created the more contemporary \"The IT Crowd,\" says he was arrested by five armed officers at London's Heathrow Airport on Monday over his social media posts.",
      "On his page on the Substack platform, Linehan said he asserted in one of the X posts in question that trans women being in female-only spaces was a, \"violent, abusive act,\" and added a call for people who see trans women in such spaces to, \"make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails punch him in the balls.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday that the police force was still discussing Linehan's arrest with the Crown Prosecution Service, which determines whether any formal charges should be filed against people suspected of crimes.",
      "U.K. Supreme Court issues key ruling on definition of \"woman\" under existing equality law",
      "U.K. Supreme Court issues key ruling on definition of \"woman\" under existing equality law",
      "Linehan, 57, is due to appear in court Thursday in a separate case, in which he has been charged with the online harassment of an 18-year-old transgender woman called Sophia Brooks. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.",
      "Metropolitan Police Chief Sir Mark Rowley has defended the officers who took Linehan into custody at Heathrow, saying in a statement seen by CBS News that the decision to arrest Linehan, \"was made within existing legislation \u2014 which dictates that a threat to punch someone from a protected group could be an offense.\"",
      "But, Rowley added: \"I don't believe we should be policing toxic culture wars debates and officers are currently in an impossible position.\"",
      "He said police would \"make similar decisions in future unless the law and guidance is changed or clarified.\"",
      "Britain's laws against inciting violence have been in place for decades, but in more recent years, specific legislation has also barred hate that targets people based on their sexual orientation or gender.",
      "Rowley acknowledged \"concern caused by such incidents given differing perspectives on the balance between free speech and the risks of inciting violence in the real world,\" and said Met officers would now pursue people over social media posts only, \"where there is a clear risk of harm or disorder.\"",
      "\"Where there is ambiguity in terms of intent and harm, policing has been left between a rock and a hard place by successive governments who have given officers no choice but to record such incidents as crimes when they're reported,\" he said.",
      "\"A long history of free speech\"",
      "The arrest of the Emmy award-winning writer has reignited a debate in the U.K. over freedom of speech, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer urging police on Wednesday to \"focus on the most serious issues.\"",
      "Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling, well known as outspoken in her stance on gender and trans issues, called Linehan's arrest \"utterly deplorable\" and \"totalitarianism,\" while X owner and former aid to President Trump Elon Musk called Britain a \"police state.\"",
      "Far-right British politician Nigel Farage, an ally of Mr. Trump whose Reform Party is currently leading others in U.K. opinion polls, said he would raise the case, and others, when he gives evidence to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday.",
      "\"The Graham Linehan case is yet another example of the war on freedom in the U.K.,\" he said ahead of his appearance in front of the House Judiciary Committee. \"Free speech is under assault, and I am urging the USA to be vigilant.\"",
      "But there was support for the police's arrest of Linehan from some British politicians, including the newly-appointed leader of the Green Party, Zack Polanski.",
      "Speaking Tuesday night on the BBC's \"Newsnight\" program, Polanski called Linehan's posts on social media \"totally unacceptable.\"",
      "\"Proportionality of police response is a conversation that we need to have,\" Polanski said, but he added that he could not understand why it would require five armed police officers to make such an arrest.",
      "Starmer, meanwhile, told Britain's parliament on Wednesday that there is \"a long history of free speech in this country,\" and \"we must ensure the police focus on the most serious issues.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:17:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Health officials say Israel's growing offensive has killed at least 287 Gazans since international scholars, including Holocaust experts, called the war genocidal.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's expanding military offensive has killed at least 287 people in Gaza in the three days since a group of world-leading genocide scholars declared that Israel is committing genocide in the besieged Palestinian enclave, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory.",
      "The International Association of Genocide Scholars \u2014 which includes Holocaust experts \u2014 declared in an Aug. 31 resolution that Israel's actions in Gaza since the 22-month war began constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "As evidence, the group pointed to the killing or maiming of 50,000 children; Israeli leaders characterizing Palestinians in Gaza as \"human animals\" and threatening to \"flatten\" the territory and turn it into hell; and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsing President Trump's plan for the U.S. to\u00a0\"take over\" the strip\u00a0and have all of its inhabitants \"resettled\" elsewhere.",
      "The territory was home to approximately 2.3 million people before the war, which Israel launched in retaliation for the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack orchestrated by Gaza's Hamas rulers. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed in that attack, and 251 others were taken as hostages into Gaza. Israel's leader has said 20 of those captives are still believed to be alive.",
      "Israel's Foreign Ministry dismissed the latest allegation of genocide, saying it was \"entirely based on Hamas' campaign of lies and the laundering of those lies by others.\" Its statement went on to say that it was the Israeli people who were actually subjected to genocide by Hamas with the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.",
      "Numerous leading human rights bodies, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Israeli organization B'Tselem and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, had all previously concluded that Israel's military operation in Gaza amounted to genocide. Israel has rejected all of the accusations, saying they are based on a false Hamas narrative.",
      "Since the scholars group declared a genocide on Aug. 31, the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health has reported at least 287 people killed by Israeli operations, bringing the total death toll to at least 63,746, as well as 161,245 wounded, since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Israel has not allowed international journalists to enter Gaza and operate freely since the war began, despite repeated requests from CBS News and other organizations, so it is impossible to verify the health ministry's figures, which do not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties. The U.N. considers the death toll reported by the ministry the most accurate information available, and Israel, while consistently denying the figures, has not provided its own reports on Palestinians killed during the war.",
      "The U.N. Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said Wednesday, meanwhile, that at least 21,000 Gazan children had been rendered disabled by Israeli assaults since the war began.",
      "Fear grows along with Israel's offensive in Gaza City",
      "Israel recently declared Gaza City, the biggest population center in the Palestinian territory, a \"dangerous combat zone,\" and its forces have pushed forward with a controversial plan to seize the metropolis, which Israel's leader says is necessary to defeat Hamas.",
      "Parts of the city are already considered \"red zones,\" where Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate ahead of expected heavy fighting.",
      "That has left residents on edge, including many who returned after fleeing the city in the initial stages of the war. With Israeli bulldozers razing the ground in occupied neighborhoods and some Israeli politicians openly supporting the mass relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, many of the city's residents fear that departing now could mean leaving for good.",
      "Moving costs thousands of dollars and finding space in the overcrowded south to pitch a tent feels impossible. But staying behind, many say, could be deadly.",
      "\"The Israeli forces, when they mark any area by red color and they request the people to leave, they really will destroy it,\" Mohammed Alkurdi, who is sheltering in Gaza City along with hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, told The Associated Press. \"So it's like you decide whether to live or die. It's very simple like that.\"",
      "Since Israel declared the area a combat zone on Friday, a small fraction \u2014 some 14,840 Palestinians of the nearly 1 million that the U.N. estimates are still in Gaza City \u2014 had left their homes as of Monday, most to flee to the south, according to the Site Management Cluster, a joint humanitarian body that coordinates assistance for people in displacement sites.",
      "A fraction of them, about 2,200, have moved to new places within Gaza City after being displaced by Israeli attacks.",
      "Alkurdi, a project manager and consultant, told the AP he could hear Israeli forces from the apartment where he's sheltering as they \"erase the area completely.\"",
      "Zeitoun was once Gaza City's largest neighborhood, filled with markets, schools and clinics. Over the last month, large swaths of it and the neighboring area of Sabra have been flattened, according to satellite photos reviewed by the AP from early August and early September. The photos show entire blocks have been pummeled or bulldozed into empty, sandy lots.",
      "\"It's not something partial like before. It's 100%,\" Alkurdi said. \"The house, I'm telling my friends, it keeps dancing all the day. It keeps dancing, going right and left like an earthquake.\"",
      "Many of the people in the city moved back to the north during a ceasefire in January, hoping to find their homes intact. Alkurdi's home was completely destroyed, so he's now living alone in a western area of the city. His children and wife were able to leave Gaza last year. He said he would flee south if his home fell under an evacuation order.",
      "Netanyahu defended the Gaza City offensive before it began, insisting the Israeli military had \"no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.\" He has said repeatedly that the objective of the war is to demilitarize the enclave, maintain the Israeli military's \"overriding security control\" over it, and put a non-Israeli civilian administration in charge. He also says it is aimed at freeing the remaining hostages, though many of the captives' families have voiced concern that expanding the offensive into densely packed Gaza City will put them at greater risk.",
      "For Gaza's residents, the operation is already bringing more violence, and the prospect of more upheaval.",
      "Amal Seyam is the general director of the Women's Affairs Center in Gaza. Originally from the Tuffah neighborhood in eastern Gaza City, her home was destroyed by bombardment. For nearly four months, she has been sheltering in the Nasr neighborhood in the city's west, where she stays alongside her colleagues inside the women's center.",
      "Seyam has been displaced five times since the war began \u2014 three times within the city and twice to the south, in Rafah and Khan Younis. Each time, she fled with nothing.",
      "When asked if she would consider leaving Gaza City as Israeli forces advance, Seyam said: \"I will only leave when everyone who needs me here leaves. As long as there's a woman who needs me, I am staying. All of Gaza feels like it's in the red zone now anyway. The bombing is happening meters from us, not kilometers.\"",
      "She paused, her voice breaking into tears.",
      "\"Many people have started packing. Many have already left. Do you know what displacement means? It means moving once again, building your life once again, buying new things, blankets, tents, all over again.\"",

    "story": [
      "The United States will keep assets positioned in the Caribbean and strike anyone \"trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday morning, a day after President Donald Trump said the U.S. military had attacked and destroyed a drug-carrying vessel in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. had struck the boat\u00a0in international waters after it had departed from Venezuela. The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social\u00a0that 11 people were killed in the strike. He said the attack targeted members of\u00a0Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that has been\u00a0designated\u00a0as a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration.",
      "Mr. Trump also posted a video that appeared to show a military strike obliterating a small boat in the open sea.",
      "Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday morning that he watched the strike live. He said the video was \"definitely not artificial intelligence,\" as Venezuela's Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez claimed in a post on social media. Hegseth said that he could not elaborate on how the operation had been carried out, but said it was a \"precision\" attack.",
      "\"We knew exactly who was in that boat, we knew exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented, and that was Tren de Aragua ... trying to poison our country with illicit drugs,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth did not say how the government identified the boat or those aboard it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Tuesday that he believed the drugs were headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or another country in the Caribbean. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, praised the strike in a statement issued late Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hegseth said Wednesday that the strike shows that \"President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been\" when dealing with drug smugglers.",
      "\"You want to try to traffic drugs, it's a new day,\" the defense secretary said. \"It's a different day, and so those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"",
      "Hegseth said that assets will remain in the region, and that further strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" he said. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0directed the military\u00a0to target drug cartels in Latin America last month. In August, the U.S. said the Navy would increase its presence near Venezuela and deploy multiple warships as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0called the move\u00a0an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" Maduro responded by deploying\u00a0warships and drones to Venezuela's coastline.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela directly. When Hegseth was asked Wednesday by Fox News about the possibility of a regime change in the country, he said it was a \"presidential decision.\" The Trump administration has\u00a0accused Maduro's government\u00a0of working with drug cartels and groups like Tren de Aragua to bring illicit substances into the United States.",
      "A U.S. federal court charged Maduro\u00a0with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking\u00a0in 2020, allegations that Maduro has denied. The U.S. is offering a $50 million\u00a0reward for Maduro's arrest.",
      "\"What we have, there in the Caribbean, is clear demonstration of military might,\" Hegseth said in the \"Fox & Friends\" interview. \"President Trump has shown whether it is southwest border, Houthis, (Operation) Midnight Hammer in Iran, precise power could impact and reshape dynamics around the world and in the region. Nicolas Maduro, as he considers whether to be a narco-trafficker, has decisions to make.\"",

      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0The British Embassy in Cairo said Sunday that it had temporarily closed its main building after Egyptian authorities removed concrete security barriers from around the compound's exterior perimeter. The barriers had been there for decades as a security measure.",
      "\"The main Embassy building is temporarily closed while we review the impact of works undertaken by the Egyptian authorities in the vicinity,\" a U.K. Foreign Office spokesperson told CBS News in a statement on Monday, noting that the embassy remained in operation and only the primary building was closed.",
      "There was no official comment from the Egyptian government about the removal of the barriers outside the U.K. embassy, but the move came amid escalating diplomatic tension between Egypt and several countries over protests targeting Egyptian missions abroad, including in the Netherlands, Austria, France, Turkey, the U.K., Canada, the U.S, and in Israel.",
      "In recent months, pro-Palestinian demonstrators have chained the doors of Egyptian embassies and consulates closed from the outside and spray-painted slogans on their walls, mostly demanding the opening of the Rafah crossing between northeast Egypt and the war-torn Gaza Strip.",
      "Egyptian officials have said their side of the Rafah crossing has remained open since the Gaza war erupted almost two years ago, while the Israeli military controls the Palestinian side and how much aid is allowed in, and how many people are allowed out.",
      "The Egyptian authorities have argued that the protests are not random nor peaceful, but rather organized attacks against the country, and they have accused European host governments of failing to protect their staff and diplomatic premises from vandalism.",
      "Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty was heard in a video circulated online suggesting Egypt could take reciprocal action, saying: \"If their governments won't provide adequate security for our missions, then we should reconsider our own deployments.\"",

      "In a\u00a0statement published online that day by the Egyptian government, the foreign ministry said it was following his detention \"with great concern\" and had requested urgent clarification of the circumstances surrounding the arrest, stressing Egypt expected his \"prompt release.\"",
      "Social media videos show the activist was released after being detained, and there were no charges announced. A spokesperson for London's Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrest of a 36-year-old man in a statement sent to CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "The police said officers were called at 10 p.m. local time on Aug. 25 \"to reports of a man with a knife in a caf\u00e9\" in London's Westminster area. The spokesperson said he \"was arrested at the scene on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon, threats to kill and affray,\" and confirmed that he was later released on bail.",
      "Amid the dispute, a relatively new political party in Egypt, the National Front Party, issued a lengthy statement declaring solidarity with the foreign ministry and condemning the activist's detention in London.",

      "Together, they have\u00a0been dubbed\u00a0an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts, and Xi's decision to bring together the leaders of some of the most\u00a0heavily sanctioned nations\u00a0in the world was clearly calculated. The parade was the first time that Kim had ever appeared together with both Xi and Putin \u2014 offering him a first multilateral diplomatic event.",
      "Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian and the leader of Myanmar's ruling military junta, President Min Aung Hlaing, were also there, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Xi and Putin have made their ambition to shake up the global status quo clear for several years.",
      "\"We, together with you and with our sympathizers, will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\" Russia's longtime Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in 2022, ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "The gathering in Beijing represented a clear challenge to President Trump's claim to be fostering close working relationships with Xi, Putin and Kim.",
      "Mr. Trump had a go at China on social media, saying American soldiers deserve credit for helping China defeat Japanese forces during WWII. He went on to accuse China, Russia and North Korea of conspiring against the U.S., which a Kremlin spokesperson dismissed as possible irony.",
      "Xi's bond with Putin was on clear and deliberate display in the days leading up to the parade, as well.",
      "China and Russia have declared their \"no limits partnership\" and, while China claims to maintain a neutral stance on Russia's war in Ukraine, Beijing's support of the war effort \u2014 by providing dual-use technology and continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas in defiance of Western sanctions, has proven to be an economic lifeline funding Putin's three-and-a-half-year war.",
      "During talks at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday, Putin hailed \"unprecedentedly high relations\" with China and thanked his \"dear friend\" Xi for the warm welcome.",
      "Kim's support for Russia's war has been even more direct. Since October last year, North Korea has sent around 13,000 troops, along with conventional weapons, to support Russia's war effort. South Korea's intelligence services estimate that around 2,000 North Korean troops have been killed fighting alongside Russian forces.",
      "The parade was a show of both China and Russia's implicit support for Kim's nuclear weapons program, which remains the subject of numerous United Nations sanctions.",
      "Xi burnished his credentials as a geopolitical powerbroker at a regional security summit in Tianjin, northern China, that ended on Monday. He hosted more than 20 world leaders there, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "\"We should uphold fairness and justice,\" Xi declared at the gathering of the Shanghai Corporation Organization, seemingly trying to claim moral high ground amid the upheaval and strained relationships caused by Mr. Trump's global trade war and isolationist policies. \"We must oppose the Cold War mentality, block confrontation and bullying practices.\"",
      "Without mentioning the U.S. or its president by name, Xi told the assembled leaders of non-Western countries: \"We must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics.\"",
      "On Monday Xi, Putin and Modi were shown together smiling and laughing at the summit \u2014 a deliberate public display of warmth and camaraderie. Just last week, the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a close ally of Mr. Trump, called the summit \"performative\" and accused China and India of being \"bad actors\" for fueling Russia's war.",
      "At the parade this week, Xi was not only asserting China as a reliable and stable partner, but also showing off his country's burgeoning alliances, influence and military power \u2014 and the potential to back up his vision of a new world order. It was a message that many see as being aimed squarely, if not entirely, at China's rival across the Pacific.",

      "When is China's military parade?",

      "Who is attending China's military parade?",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are among the dignitaries who attended the parade. It was the first time Kim, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin appeared together. The trio has\u00a0been dubbed an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts.",

      "The 70-minute parade displayed China's growing military might and newest hardware, including hypersonic weapons, nuclear-capable missiles, fighter jets and underwater drones. According to The Associated Press, in a speech, Xi said humanity today must choose between peace and war and between dialogue and confrontation.",
      "How did President Trump respond?",
      "In a\u00a0post to Truth Social on Tuesday evening, President Trump noted that the U.S. and China were allies against Japan during WWII, writing that the \"big question to be  answered is whether or not President Xi of China will mention the massive amount of support and 'blood' that The United States of America gave to China in order to help it to secure its FREEDOM from a very unfriendly foreign invader.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. military on Tuesday struck a drug-carrying boat hailing from Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, as tensions spike between the Trump administration and the Venezuelan government.",
      "President Trump announced the strike during an unrelated Tuesday afternoon Oval Office event, saying the military had \"shot out\" the boat \"moments ago.\" He said his team had been briefed on the strike by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social that 11 people were killed in the strike, which he said targeted members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that the Trump administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. He posted a video that appeared to show a military strike against a small boat.",
      "\"Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!\" the president wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Rubio posted on X that the military carried out a \"lethal strike\" in the southern Caribbean Sea. He said the \"drug vessel\" had departed Venezuela and \"was being operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization.\" Rubio later told reporters he believed the drugs that were allegedly carried on the boat were probably headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or \"some other country in the Caribbean.\" A senior defense official also said the U.S. had conducted a \"precision strike\" against the vessel.",
      "The strike came after the U.S. confirmed last month\u00a0that the Navy would boost its presence near Venezuela, deploying three warships to the waters off the South American country as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro called the ships an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat\" and deployed military forces to the country's coastline, vowing to defend against any possible U.S. attack.",

Maduro was charged with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking in U.S. federal court in 2020. Last month, Attorney General Pam Bondi doubled the reward for Maduro's arrest to $50 million.",

    "summary": "President Trump has touted himself as a Nobel-worthy peacemaker. Here's what some foreign policy analysts say about the disputes he cites.",
    "story": [
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves credit for ending six or seven wars during his first months in office, arguing that he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.",
      "\"I stopped seven wars, and they were, they're big ones too,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "\"I've settled six wars, and a lot of people say seven because there's one that nobody knows about,\" he said in an August 19 interview.",
      "A White House official provided a list of seven conflicts the president is referencing: Israel and Iran, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.",
      "\"There has been more progress towards peace than ever before because of this President's leadership,\" the official wrote.",
      "The recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace prize is expected to be announced next month.",
      "Over 100 people have received the award since the 19th-century chemist Alfred Nobel created the prize to honor a \"person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"",
      "Four U.S. presidents have been past laureates, most recently Barack Obama who received the prize for supporting nuclear nonproliferation and international diplomacy.",
      "Foreign policy experts say that while Mr. Trump has helped broker ceasefires, including one between Israel and Iran, several of the foreign conflicts cited by the administration were not full-scale wars \u2014 and many remain unresolved. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification on why the president has repeatedly labeled all seven conflicts as settled wars.",
      "Some of these peace efforts involved limited U.S. involvement, and in other instances, it remains unclear whether Mr. Trump's role was decisive.",
      "Here's a look at the conflicts:",
      "Israel and Iran",
      "After Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities in June, a 12-day conflict resulted in the deaths of about 28 Israelis and hundreds of Iranians before a ceasefire was reached with U.S. and Qatari involvement. Mr. Trump claimed credit, saying he had ordered U.S. airstrikes on Iran's uranium enrichment sites and pressed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold back from further strikes.",
      "Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at Brookings, said Mr. Trump deserves some credit for this ceasefire. \"He managed to use a combination of a good relationship with Netanyahu, but also a willingness to put a little pressure on Netanyahu that I think contributed to the at least temporary cessation of hostilities,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "But other foreign policy experts said tensions between the nations are far from resolved, and Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in early July that the Defense Department estimated the U.S. strikes likely delayed Iran's nuclear program by \"one to two years.\"",
      "Larry Haas, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council said, \"I very strongly disagree with the notion that the president brought peace to Iran and Israel. We may be in a quiet period in terms of direct confrontation, but Iran right now is trying to regroup.\"",
      "Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo",
      "In June, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo announced a\u00a0peace deal after multiple days of talks in Washington mediated by President Trump and Qatar.",
      "The deal aimed to end three decades of fighting over Congo's mineral reserves. Yet the violence has continued, with both sides accusing each other of violating peace terms. Human Rights Watch reported that M23, an armed group that U.S. officials believe is backed by Rwanda, killed over 140 civilians in eastern Congo in July.",
      "\"It's a premature declaration of success, when in fact we are just getting to the starting line,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "Armenia and Azerbaijan",
      "In August, Mr. Trump helped negotiate an agreement aimed at normalizing relations and\u00a0 reopening transportation routes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have spent decades fighting for control of the Karabakh region.",
      "O'Hanlon and Haas agreed the Trump administration pushed the deal forward in part by inviting both leaders to the White House. Leaders of both countries also credited Mr. Trump for the agreement, saying he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "But the deal is not a formal peace agreement and requires ratification. One remaining sticking point is that Azerbaijan wants Armenia to remove any mention of territorial claims to Azerbaijan's land from its constitution before officials sign a final deal.\u00a0 Armenia's prime minister has expressed willingness to change the constitution but has not specified a date for a referendum.",
      "Thailand and Cambodia",
      "In late July, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a ceasefire after an outbreak of fighting killed at least 35 people. President Trump said that he had pressured both sides to come to the table by threatening trade consequences.",
      "The U.S. is a top importer for both counties, and foreign policy experts CBS News spoke to said Mr. Trump's tariff threats played a significant role in securing a ceasefire. \"He helped move things along with economic pressure,\" Haas said.",
      "The border dispute is continuing, though, with Thai officials accusing Cambodia of laying new landmines. Cambodia denied doing so.",
      "India and Pakistan",
      "India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in May after weeks of cross-border missile and drone strikes. The deal ended the latest flare-up in their long-running dispute over Kashmir, which both nuclear-armed nations claim as their territory.",
      "Pakistan credited the Trump administration's efforts in U.S.-led talks, and nominated him for the Nobel Peace prize. But India insisted its own pressure on Pakistan, not U.S. diplomacy, drove the deal.",
      "Josh Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it's a stretch to call the dispute over Kashmir settled.",
      "\"There is no real ending to this conflict,\" he said, noting that future negotiations could be complicated by Mr. Trump's decision to impose steep tariffs on India, a key partner.",
      "Egypt and Ethiopia",
      "Mr. Trump also claims he brokered peace between Ethiopia and Egypt, which have disagreed about Ethiopia's decision to construct a hydroelectric dam in the Nile.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump tried to\u00a0broker a deal between the countries and\u00a0suspended some aid to Ethiopia because of a lack of progress. In June, the president mentioned the dispute on Truth Social, writing, \"There is peace, at least for now, because of my intervention, and it will stay that way!\"",
      "No deals have been announced, however. Ethiopia still plans to officially open its dam in September over Egypt's objections that it will restrict the flow of water to its country. And while Egypt previously threatened to go to war over the dam, this conflict has remained a diplomatic one.",
      "O'Hanlon said of the dispute, \"I would not call the Egypt-Ethiopia interaction a war.\"",
      "Serbia and Kosovo",
      "In 2020, President Trump helped negotiate\u00a0a deal between Serbia and Kosovo to help normalize economic ties, but progress stalled afterward.",
      "Talks have continued with European leaders, but no breakthroughs have emerged. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which Serbia still does not recognize.",
      "\"His deal-making, to the extent that it existed, actually occurred in his first term, and he really hasn't stopped what's going on,\" Haas said.",

      "The authenticity of the artwork cannot be confirmed until it is recovered, but it is believed to have been stolen from Amsterdam art dealer Jacques Goudstikker during World War II. Goudstikker died while fleeing the Netherlands in 1940 when the country was invaded by Nazi Germany.",
      "The for-sale notice revealed what is believed to be the Ghislandi painting in the house of Friedrich Kadgien, a financial adviser to Adolf Hitler's right-hand man and an art aficionado who plundered paintings taken from Jewish-owned galleries in Nazi-occupied Europe, according to The Associated Press. Kadgien  later fled to Argentina, along with other Nazi war criminals. He died in 1978.",
      "Interpol and the Argentine federal police are involved in the search for the artwork.",

When Argentine police entered the house last week, they found a tapestry of a horse hanging in the spot the painting had been in the pictures, AP reported.

      "The prosecutor's office said investigators carrying out the search had seized two other artworks from the home of another Kadgien daughter that appeared to be from the 1800s.",
      "\"The works will be analyzed to determine if they are linked to paintings stolen during World War II,\" the office added.",

Bruen, in which a new standard to determine whether a gun restriction is unconstitutional was established. To meet that standard, the government must show there is a \"historical tradition of firearm regulation\" that supports the law. The court said there were no analogous conditions justifying the gun restrictions on public transit.",

And say, 'We do have a problem, and we'd love you to send in the troops because, you know what, the people, they have to be protected,'\" Trump said Tuesday while fielding questions from the media at a White House event.",
      "Chicago and Baltimore are two of the nation's most notoriously violent cities, with Baltimore ranked as the fourth most dangerous city to live in the U.S., according to a U.S. News and World Report study published in 2025. Chicago is reeling from a bloody Labor Day weekend that left at least 58 people shot and eight killed. In 2021, Chicago recorded its deadliest year since 1996, with data published by the city showing crime has ticked down in the Windy City since about 2023.",

      "The sentiment echoes the rhetoric of 2020, when activists and supporters of the defund the police movement championed cutting police budgets and redirecting the funds to community services such as housing, education, mental health services and community-based responders who would manage certain emergency calls such as a mental health crisis instead of police officers. Proponents of the movement argued such reallocation of police funds would wipe out crime and foster peace, as opposed to arresting and prosecuting criminals.",

The spike in murders came as activists nationwide took to the streets that summer to protest police departments in response to the police-involved killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day 2020.",
      "Floyd's death, as well as the deaths of other Black Americans during police stops or interactions, reignited the Black Lives Matter movement, founded in 2013, which has called for defunding police departments stretching back more than a decade concerning claims the U.S. justice system and policing overall are rooted in systemic racism.",
      "Cities from Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco to Atlanta saw repeated protests demanding police departments be defunded, while riots broke out amid the protests that led to businesses being destroyed and an increase in attacks on police officers as the sentiment in the U.S. toward the officers in blue soured.",
      "Portland, Oregon, saw 100 nights of protests and riots that summer, while Seattle rioters took over a police precinct and declared it the \"Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,\" which was fortified by barriers and established as a cop-free zone. At least two teenagers were shot dead and others were injured as violence broke out that summer.",

Schwalb called the moves \"brazenly unlawful\" that could \"wreak operational havoc\" on the Metropolitan Police Department.",

We think that there is more accountability in the system, or at least perceived accountability in the system, that is driving down illegal behavior.

      "Leading members of President Donald Trump's political team met Wednesday behind closed doors with House Republicans to offer what's being described as a \"clear and simple\" message to sell the GOP's sweeping domestic policy package to Americans.",
      "The sales pitch, from top Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio, senior Trump political aide James Blair, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, is part of an ongoing effort by the president and his team to rebrand the massive tax cuts and spending measure, which polls indicate isn't popular with Americans.",
      "\"The best marketer out there is our president,\" National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) chair Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina told Fox News' Aishah Hasnie following the meeting.",
      "Hudson noted that Trump \"used the name One Big Beautiful Bill to help get it passed. And now, to try and explain to the American people, he's suggesting we call it the Working Families Tax Cut, which is exactly what it is. It's a big component of it.\"",

      "But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) argued that \"the so-called rebrand of the Big, Ugly Law is an admission that the GOP\u2019s signature legislative \u2018achievement\u2019 is a toxic failure.\"",
      "\"Only Republicans seem surprised that ripping away health care and gutting rural hospitals just to hand billionaires a massive tax break is completely out of step with what the American people want,\" DCCC spokesperson Justin Chermol claimed in a statement to Fox News Digital.",
      "The package narrowly passed through the Republican-controlled Congress earlier this summer, nearly entirely along party lines, and Trump signed it into law during a July 4 ceremony at the White House.",
      "For months, Trump touted his Big Beautiful Bill, but at a Cabinet meeting last week he seemed to acknowledge the difficult sales job he and his party face.",
      "\"I'm not going to use the term great, big, beautiful - that was good for getting it approved, but it's not good for explaining to people what it's really about,\" Trump said.",
      "And he described the package as a \"major tax cut for workers.\"",
      "FIRST ON FOX: MAJOR GOP-ALIGNED GROUP SPOTLIGHTS TAX CUTS IN REPUBLICANS SWEEPING MEASURE",
      "The measure is stuffed full of Trump's 2024 campaign trail promises and second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit.",
      "It includes extending the president's signature 2017 tax cuts, which were set to expire later this year, and eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay.",
      "The shift in branding that Trump noted last week has already been reflected by Vice President JD Vance, who has been stopping in key 2026 midterm states to sell the measure.",

      "At his earlier stops on his tour, Vance called the package the \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\" But the vice president now refers to the measure repeatedly as the \"Working Families Tax Cut.\"",
      "The package also provides billions for border security and codifies the president's sweeping and controversial immigration crackdown.",
      "And the new law also restructures Medicaid \u2014 the almost 60-year-old federal program that provides health coverage to roughly 71 million low-income Americans.",
      "The changes to Medicaid, as well as cuts to food stamps, another one of the nation's major safety net programs, were drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump's tax cuts. The measure includes a slew of new rules and regulations, including work requirements for many of those seeking Medicaid coverage.",
      "MESSAGING WAR OVER BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL HEATS UP",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the new law could result in roughly 10 million people losing health coverage, and $3.4 trillion added to the nation's already massive federal deficit. Republicans dispute those projections.",
      "Regardless, some Republican House members who've held town halls this summer have faced vocal constituents angry over the social safety net cuts in the GOP's measure.",
      "And Democrats for months have repeatedly blasted Republicans over those social safety net changes. They charge it will gut Medicaid, forcing rural hospitals and nursing homes to close their doors.",
      "\"Rural hospitals were already on the brink of collapse thanks to Donald Trump, but now he has put the last nail in the coffin for rural hospitals with his billionaire budget bill,\" Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Ken Martin claimed.",
      "Republicans have pushed back on the Democrats' criticism.",
      "\"Overall, most people's awareness comes from the lies they've heard from Democrats and our mainstream media. But when they hear the details of what's in the actual bill, it's very, very popular,\" Hudson told Fox News.",

      "According to sources in the room, the president's political advisors urged House Republicans to court low-propensity Trump voters who supported the president in 2024 but traditionally don't turn out for midterm elections.",
      "The GOP is aiming to defend its fragile House majority in next year's midterms, when the party in power normally faces political headwinds and ends up losing congressional seats.",

      "159-YEAR-OLD COMPANY EMBRACES DRIVERLESS TRUCKS",
      "PlusAI reports that its driverless trucks could be ready to hit the road within the next two years. (PlusAI)",
      "Why PlusAI's 2025 results matter for autonomous trucks",
      "Even if you never step into a truck, these results affect your daily life. Every product you buy travels by truck at some point, whether it's groceries, clothing or furniture. The way those trucks operate influences cost, availability and safety on the road.",
      "The trucking industry faces three major challenges. There are not enough long-haul drivers to meet demand. Costs continue to rise due to labor shortages, tariffs and fuel prices. And safety is a concern because human drivers can get tired or distracted.",
      "Autonomous trucks could help address each of these issues. PlusAI's vehicles are already hauling freight on Texas highways today, and they are also undergoing road testing in Sweden. The company has already logged more than 5 million autonomous miles across the United States, Europe and Asia. That real-world experience fuels the AI system with the data it needs to improve.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "The PlusAI Safety Case Framework. Data shows that self-driving trucks will roll out by 2027. (PlusAI)",
      "How PlusAI plans to launch autonomous trucks by 2027",
      "PlusAI has created a roadmap that sets it apart. Instead of retrofitting trucks with autonomous systems, it is working with major manufacturers like TRATON GROUP, Hyundai and IVECO to integrate the technology at the factory. This approach makes scaling production faster and ensures consistency.",
      "The initial launch is planned for the Texas Triangle, a major freight corridor connecting Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. From there, PlusAI plans to expand into other U.S. routes and eventually Europe.",
      "The company has also committed to publishing regular performance updates as it transitions to a public company. By sharing measurable results, PlusAI builds trust with regulators, the public, and businesses that may one day rely on its trucks to move goods.",
      "\"We have a clear roadmap to the commercial launch of SuperDrive,\" said David Liu, CEO and co-founder of PlusAI. \"By publicly sharing these performance metrics, we are showing our commitment to safety and scalability while bringing partners, customers, and regulators along on this journey.\"",
      "What's next for PlusAI and driverless freight trucks?",
      "PlusAI still has milestones to meet. Safety readiness must rise from 86% to 100%. Remote Assistance Free Trips must surpass 90%. These are ambitious goals, but the progress so far suggests the company can achieve them.",
      "Fleet trials are scheduled to begin later this year, and PlusAI continues testing in both the United States and internationally. Each step adds to the case that driverless trucks will be ready for commercial launch in 2027.",

      "What this means for you",
      "As a shopper, autonomous trucks could mean faster and more affordable deliveries. As a driver, you may soon share highways with self-driving freight haulers. As a business owner, this technology could reduce logistics costs and ease the impact of driver shortages.",
      "The bigger picture is that autonomous trucks are moving from testing to real use. They are no longer limited to pilot projects. You may see them alongside you on the road sooner than expected.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Forget roaring lawnmowers and fuel-guzzling tractors. Today's solar companies are turning to flocks of sheep to trim grass and control weeds under solar panels. These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time. In fact, using sheep instead of gas-powered mowing crews can reduce upkeep expenses by up to 20 percent.",

      "WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR",
      "Why solar grazing with sheep cuts costs and emissions",
      "Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reduce carbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.",
      "WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE JOINING A POWER SAVER PROGRAM",
      "Sheep graze near solar panels in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "How agrivoltaics turns sheep and solar panels into profits",
      "This isn't your average landscaping story. There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy production with agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.",
      "Chad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.",
      "How sheep improve soil health and boost biodiversity at solar farms",
      "Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.",
      "Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't just power generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.",

      "Sheep grazing cuts operations and maintenance costs for solar operators. (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "Major solar farms scale up sheep grazing across thousands of acres",
      "This isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.",
      "At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.",
      "Investors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "Chad Raines opens the gate to a solar panel zone in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024. This solar farm has six different solar panel zones on 1,800 acres of land.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "What solar grazing means for you",
      "If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.",
      "For everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fight climate change, all at once. As solar farms expand across the country, expect to see more flocks doing the work of machines, quietly transforming how we power the planet.",

This approach blends sustainability with practicality. It supports healthier soil, boosts biodiversity and strengthens rural economies, all while helping solar farms operate more efficiently.

The system gives pilots two aural alerts when an unauthorized aircraft enters the runway on a collision course with the authorized aircraft. The first alert sounds 30 seconds before a collision, and the second alert sounds 15 seconds before a collision.",

On Test Flight 757's approach to Topeka, a Honeywell crew member parked a smaller Gulfstream aircraft at the end of the runway, triggering the SURF-A alert system. After hearing both alerts, the pilot performed a \"go-around\" maneuver.",
      "The demonstration simulated a 2023 close call at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Austin, Texas. In that scenario, a FedEx B767 was cleared to land in poor conditions. As the FedEx plane got closer, the pilots noticed a Southwest Airlines B737 lined up on the runway below them. The FedEx pilots were able to perform a last-second go-around maneuver to avoid a collision, but Honeywell says the SURF-A system, which wasn't around at the time, would have given the pilots an additional 28 seconds of notice.",

If those attachments shift to chatbots, kids may learn to trust machines more than people.

That responsiveness can be powerful. It can encourage curiosity, vocabulary growth, and even creativity. But it can also crowd out human interactions, those subtle facial expressions, pauses, and \"nos\" that children need to experience to learn empathy and resilience. Another risk is that AI companions are trained to be overly charming and agreeable. Instead of challenging a child's thinking, these\u00a0\"sycophantic\" toys may simply tell kids what they want to hear. Over time, that could nudge children toward believing comforting lies instead of asking hard questions, a toxic pattern for developing critical thinking.",

      "Hackers stole 13 million records, exposing data of 4.4 million Americans in the latest TransUnion cyberattack. (Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg)",
      "What you need to know about the TransUnion data breach",
      "TransUnion has disclosed a major data breach that impacted 4,461,511 individuals in the United States, according to a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office. The incident occurred on July 28, 2025, and was discovered two days later on July 30.",
      "The breach resulted from unauthorized access to a third-party application used in TransUnion's U.S. consumer support operations. The company stressed that its core credit database and credit reports were not compromised.",
      "Although TransUnion characterized the exposed information as \"limited,\" the stolen data is highly sensitive. It includes names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, reasons for customer transactions (such as requests for a free credit report), and customer support tickets and messages.",
      "Hackers claim they stole more than 13 million records in total, with about 4.4 million tied to U.S. consumers.",
      "In response, TransUnion is providing all affected individuals with 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",

      "The breach at TransUnion follows several similar cyberattacks against tech companies, including Google and Cisco, and retail brands, such as Chanel and Adidas.\u00a0 (Mike Kemp/In Pictures)",
      "Hackers target companies through Salesforce apps",
      "The breach appears to be part of a broader wave of Salesforce-related attacks that is hitting organizations across sectors, from tech and finance to retail and aviation. Alongside Google, Farmers Insurance, Allianz Life, Workday, Pandora, Cisco, Chanel and Qantas, brands like Adidas, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., Cartier and Air France-KLM have also reported incidents tied to weaknesses in Salesforce-linked applications.",
      "In most cases, attackers exploited malicious third-party integrations or OAuth-connected apps disguised as legitimate Salesforce tools to siphon sensitive records. This technique bypassed traditional login protections and gave intruders long-lasting access to customer relationship management data. The stolen information ranges from basic contact details and business notes to highly sensitive identifiers such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth and driver's license information.",
      "Researchers say these intrusions align with activity from the extortion group ShinyHunters, with some overlap in tactics and infrastructure linked to other threat actors like Scattered Spider. Campaigns tracked under names such as UNC6395 and UNC6040 point to a larger \"extortion-as-a-service\" model, where criminal crews collaborate and share stolen data across underground forums.",
      "TransUnion's response",
      "CyberGuy reached out to TransUnion for a comment and received the following response:",
      "\"TransUnion recently experienced a cyber incident that affected a third-party application serving our U.S. consumer support operations. Upon discovery, we quickly contained the issue, which did not involve our core credit database or include credit reports.",
      "The incident involved unauthorized access to limited personal information for a very small percentage of U.S. consumers. We are working with law enforcement and have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts for an independent forensics review. Additionally, we will notify affected consumers and provide credit monitoring services.\"",
      "As for the gap between when the breach occurred (July 28, 2025) and when it was officially recorded as \"discovered\" (July 30, 2025), a TransUnion spokesperson clarified that the company\u00a0\"identified and contained this event within hours\" of it happening, but that it is common industry practice to designate a later \"date of discovery\" to reflect a more complete assessment following the initial response.",

      "Go through old online accounts, shopping profiles or cloud storage that may still hold sensitive data. Deleting what you no longer use reduces the amount of information that could be stolen in future breaches or sold on dark web forums. You can also get help from a data removal service.",

      "Data stolen in breaches often ends up fueling phishing campaigns. Attackers may use your name, email or phone number to make messages look more convincing. If you get an email or text claiming to be from TransUnion, your bank or any service asking you to \"verify\" details, don't click on the link. Instead, log in through the official website or call customer service directly.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your login details were exposed, reusing the same password across sites puts multiple accounts at risk. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords for every service. Even if hackers get hold of one, they won't be able to use it elsewhere. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your passwords have been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "HACKERS FOUND A WAY TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER REMOTELY",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0adds a critical extra step beyond just a password. If someone tries to break into your email, banking app or social media account, they'll also need the one-time code from your authenticator app or text message. This makes stolen credentials much less useful.",
      "Hackers often rely on outdated software to spread malware or steal information. Installing the latest updates for your phone, computer and apps ensures security patches are in place, blocking known vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.",
      "One of the biggest risks after a breach is criminals opening new loans or credit cards in your name. A credit freeze with all three major bureaus, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, prevents anyone from accessing your credit file without your approval. It's free and can be temporarily lifted if you need to apply for credit.",
      "Watch your bank and credit card statements for unfamiliar charges, no matter how small. Set up transaction alerts where available. You should also pull your free annual credit report to check for unauthorized accounts or inquiries, which could be signs of fraud.",
      "If your Social Security number, driver's license or other sensitive identifiers were exposed, you may want to sign up for an identity theft protection service. These services monitor credit reports, dark web forums and financial activity for signs of misuse. Some also include insurance or recovery assistance if your identity is stolen, giving you added peace of mind beyond basic credit monitoring. If you're one of the affected TransUnion users, make use of the 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. If not, you might get one yourself for the future.",

At first glance, these fraud messages look convincing, often including a receipt, order ID and even a support number. But instead of connecting you to Apple or another legitimate service, that number links you directly to scammers.",

      "Scammers spoof Apple, Netflix, and other brands to push fake subscription charges posing as DocuSign. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The emails often use well-known brands such as Apple, Netflix, Expedia, or even lawn service companies to make them seem credible. Some also include a \"DocuSign\" link with a security code, creating the illusion that you need to access a file to confirm the transaction.",
      "In reality, neither Apple nor these other companies sends billing receipts through DocuSign. That detail alone is a red flag. Another telltale sign is the sender's address. It may contain odd characters, such as a Cyrillic \"B\" replacing the \"B\" in \"Billing,\" which helps scammers bypass spam filters.",
      "AMAZON ALERTS CUSTOMERS ABOUT IMPERSONATION SCAMS",
      "How the DocuSign scam works",
      "The scam aims to catch you off guard and pressure you into acting fast. The email claims your Apple Pay account has been charged for a subscription or purchase. It includes an order ID, a charge amount, and a DocuSign link that supposedly holds a receipt or confirmation file. To make it look even more convincing, some versions add a security code to \"unlock\" the document.",
      "The message also lists a phone number and urges you to call if the charge was not authorized. That number is the core of the scam. Instead of reaching Apple, Netflix or whichever company the email pretends to represent, you end up speaking with a scammer posing as a support agent.",
      "Once you're on the call, the scammer tries to convince you that your account has been compromised or that the payment must be reversed right away. From there, the tactics vary. They might ask for your Apple ID, banking details, or card numbers. They may pressure you to download remote access software so they can \"fix\" the issue on your device. In some cases, they demand payment for fake account protection or reversal fees.",
      "DocuSign scam uses fake receipts and urgent language to steal personal information from users. (Kurt \"Cyberguy\" Knutsson)",

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at CyberGuy.com.",
      "Instead of trusting the email, confirm whether a charge actually exists. Apple users can review purchases directly from the Settings app under their Apple ID. If nothing shows up, the receipt is fake. Other services have similar ways to check history.",
      "The less information scammers can find about you online, the harder it is for them to craft convincing attacks. Consider removing old accounts you no longer use, limit the personal details you share publicly on social media, and use data removal services when possible. This reduces the risk of your name, email, or phone number being targeted in scams like this.",

Verardo\u2019s injuries and his choice to keep living with purpose were honored by those who rose to speak on his behalf.Fox News\u2019 Jennifer Griffin told mourners she would forever carry the image of Verardo forcing himself upright on his prosthetic leg to salute the American flag. \"Michael always stood to salute the flag, even when it was not easy or comfortable to do so,\" she said.\u00a0TRUMP SALUTES SGT.

      "\"The image that will stick with me forever was Michael standing to salute the flag on the day North Carolinians came out to welcome his beloved Afghan translator Johnny and his family after Sarah arranged their harrowing rescue during the chaotic and violent withdrawal from Afghanistan,\" Griffin said.",
      "That image captured the essence of a man who refused to give up. On April 24, 2010, an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan\u2019s Arghandab Valley took his left leg, shattered and shredded his left arm, and left him with burns and a traumatic brain injury. He was labeled \"death imminent\" by medics, but survived a coma and more than 120 surgeries.\u00a0At Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Verardo endured years of grueling rehabilitation. He learned to walk again on a prosthetic leg, and he encouraged other wounded warriors who faced their own battles. Three years after the blast, he married his high school sweetheart Sarah who stood faithfully by his side as caregiver and partner through every trial.FOUR YEARS AFTER ABBEY GATE, VETERANS WHO SAVED CIVILIANS DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY",

Sarah sought to help other families by writing \"Hero at Home,\" a children\u2019s book explaining the unseen wounds of war.\u00a0On Tuesday, their eldest daughter, now 11, stood bravely before the congregation. \"I am proud of my dad because he fought so long and so hard to stay alive for us. He never gave up,\" Gigi said. \"If I could tell him one thing right now, it would be thank you. Thank you for being my dad. I love you. I promise I will never forget you, and you\u2019ll be part of everything I do every single day.\"",
      "Even as he endured his own battles, Verardo devoted himself to lifting others. With Sarah, he championed the Independence Fund\u2019s Trackchairs program, giving wounded warriors freedom of movement once thought lost, and Operation Resiliency, a lifeline for veterans struggling after war aimed at reuniting veterans to prevent suicide. His work became a mission of service beyond the battlefield, proof that sacrifice could be transformed into hope for others.",

Back home, he made it his mission to recover, to raise a family, to help others. Michael never fully recovered from his wounds on that battlefield, but he did not let that stop him. Mission accomplished, my friend.\"",
      "Former Vice President Mike Pence spoke of a soldier whose faith never dimmed. \"Through it all, he smiled, radiating a faith and courage that inspired everyone he encountered.

      "Fox News national correspondent Jeff Paul discusses Israel\u2019s planned takeover of Gaza City amid its conflict with Hamas on \u2018Fox News Live.\u2019",
      "FIRST ON FOX: A new study disputes claims that\u00a0Israel committed genocide in Gaza following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, arguing that allegations of starvation, indiscriminate bombing and deliberate civilian killings lack verifiable evidence.",
      "The report by researchers from the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, \"Debunking the Genocide Allegations: A Reexamination of the Israel-Hamas War\" (2023-2025), contends that the genocide narrative has been driven by faulty data, uncritical sourcing and a humanitarian system vulnerable to manipulation.",
      "A key element of the genocide accusations is the claim that Israel deliberately starved Gaza\u2019s population. The study argues that \"claims of starvation prior to March 2, 2025, were based on erroneous data, circular citations, and a failure to critically review sources.\" While U.N. officials and rights groups maintained that 500 trucks a day were needed to prevent famine, prewar U.N. figures show Gaza averaged 292 daily in 2022 \u2014 only 73 of them carrying food.",

      "The Chief of the General Staff LTG Eyal Zamir, conducted a field tour in the Gaza Strip. (IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "\"That was completely adequate to meet demand,\" report co-author Danny Orbach, a military historian from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Fox News Digital.",
      "The study says Israel regularly surpassed the food supply needed during the war, averaging more than 100 trucks a day through March 2025. During a ceasefire-for-hostage deal, that number climbed to about 600 daily.",
      "\"The idea that\u00a0Hamas didn\u2019t seize aid is absurd,\" Orbach said. \"In every conflict, armed groups take the bulk of humanitarian supplies. We have documents and testimonies proving Hamas did so.\"",
      "The report argues that genocide allegations spread through what Orbach called an \"inverted funnel of information.\" Journalists and aid workers in Gaza often depended on Hamas-linked translators and fixers, whose accounts filtered into U.N. reports, mainstream media and online platforms.",
      "\"The average Westerner sees dozens of reports about Israeli crimes and assumes they must be true. But they all trace back to a handful of Hamas-affiliated sources,\" Orbach said.",
      "Israeli air strikes on Gaza a day after Hamas terrorists invaded parts of southern Israel. Oct 2023. (Mustafa Hassona/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)",
      "The second factor is \"humanitarian bias\" \u2014 the tendency to exaggerate conditions to prompt action. \"Organizations warn of famine before it happens, relying on dubious facts to change reality. Questioning becomes an immoral act,\" Orbach said.",
      "The genocide allegation also rests on claims that Israel intentionally targeted civilians, but the study acknowledges civilian deaths while finding no evidence of a systematic policy of massacre.",
      "Orbach cited BBC data showing that between May 2024 and January 2025, 550 people were killed in designated safe zones\u2014just 2.1% to 3.5% of total casualties, even though half of Gaza\u2019s population was concentrated there for much of the period.",

      "\"That indicates the zones were relatively safe, despite Hamas using them to launch rockets,\" Orbach stated.",

      "\"Hamas exposes its own people to danger intentionally so Israel will be blamed,\" Orbach said.",

      "While critics have accused the Israeli air force of indiscriminate bombing, the study finds that strikes generally targeted military objectives, though civilian casualties were inevitable.",
      "\"The IDF is the first army in history to issue\u00a0focused warnings, deliver large-scale aid into enemy territory, and sacrifice surprise to protect civilians,\" he said. \"You cannot fight an enemy embedded in 500 kilometers of tunnels, dressed as civilians without massive destruction.\"",
      "The study pays particular attention to casualty figures published by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, claiming they were manipulated to create misleading impressions of the demographics of the dead. It presents alternative statistical models suggesting combatant fatalities may have been underreported, distorting the civilian-to-combatant ratio.",
      "Hamas terrorists carrying clubs and firearms secure and divert humanitarian aid trucks in the northern Gaza area of Jabaliya on June. 25 (TPS-IL)",
      "The report says that genocide requires systematic intent to destroy a people \u2014 something it finds absent in Gaza. \"You don\u2019t see the hallmarks of genocidal warfare here,\" Orbach said. \"There are no campaigns of rape, frontal massacres or close-range executions.

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to quickly decide whether he has the power to impose broad tariffs under a law designed for use during times of emergency.",
      "The Justice Department is appealing a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday that President Donald Trump had exceeded his authority, the filings said.",
      "The filings, shared by the Justice Department and the challengers, have not yet been officially docketed by the Supreme Court.",

      "\u201cThese unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,\u201d he added.",
      "The appeals court, divided 7-4, said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate imports when there is a national emergency, does not give sweeping powers to impose global tariffs of unspecified duration.",
      "The tariffs are in effect and will remain in place until at least Oct. 14 under the appeals court ruling.",
      "The administration submitted two filings: an appeal and a motion to expedite.",
      "In the latter, Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to fast-track consideration of the case so oral arguments can be heard as soon as the first week of November. That would require the court to decide by next week whether to hear the case.",
      "The challengers have agreed to that timeline, a Liberty Justice Center spokesman said.",
      "The appeals court's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President\u2019s efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis,\" Sauer wrote.",

      "During the Biden administration, the court was skeptical of the White House\u2019s moves to seek broad powers via laws enacted by Congress that did not explicitly authorize them. In one significant example, the court, endorsing what has been dubbed the \"major questions doctrine,\" ruled against President Joe Biden's plan to forgive student loan debt.",
      "The case under appeal affects two sets of tariffs Trump has imposed. The first are the country-by-country or \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which now range from 34% for China to a 10% baseline for the rest of the world. The second is a 25% tariff Trump imposed on some goods from Canada, China and Mexico for what the administration said was their failure to curb the flow of fentanyl.",
      "Other tariffs implemented under other laws, such as 50% steel and aluminum tariffs on all other worldwide trading partners, were implemented under other statutes not at issue in the case.",
      "Even if Trump loses at the Supreme Court, he has other avenues to impose additional tariffs.",
      "V.O.S. Selections Inc., a wine and spirits importer, and Plastic Services and Products, a pipe and fittings company, are among five businesses that sued Trump over his use of the emergency law. Twelve states also challenged the move.",
      "The Court of International Trade initially blocked the tariffs in late May, prompting the Trump administration to appeal.",
      "Trump has long sought to raise revenue by taxing imported goods, which he believes will revitalize manufacturing in the United States. While the tariffs are bringing in billions of dollars in revenue, economists say they are slowing U.S. economic growth, while inflation has also ticked up."

      "Turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and states\u2019 beginning to take more control of their own vaccine decisions threaten to fracture the once-national consensus around immunization, setting the stage for a reorganization of the way vaccination recommendations work across the United States.",
      "The moves together point toward an increasingly stark divide emerging in the United States around vaccinations, with some Republican-led states starting to roll back or eliminate mandates while Democrat-led states split from the CDC to come up with their own vaccination guidance.",
      "On Wednesday, California, Oregon and Washington announced they are forming a public health alliance to provide \u201ccredible information\u201d about vaccine safety in response to the recent firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, the resignations of top scientists that followed her ousting and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s new controversial guidelines for who should get Covid shots.",
      "Last week, New Mexico\u2019s Health Department announced it was ordering pharmacies to \u201cremove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d Colorado did the same Wednesday.",
      "Also Wednesday, Florida\u2019s surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, moved to eliminate vaccination mandates across the state, including in public schools. Other states have also weighed rolling back vaccination mandates, most notably Texas, where dozens of anti-mandate bills have been introduced in the Legislature.",
      "The split comes as once-fringe and long-debunked claims about the health risks of vaccinations have found mainstream appeal and been embraced by the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cRepeatedly hearing that vaccines cause autism or that an mRNA vaccine will alter your DNA can erode public trust,\u201d said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco, referring to two of the most common pieces of vaccine misinformation.",
      "For decades, the federal government, in close collaboration with infectious disease experts, has crafted guidelines for who should receive vaccinations and when. States and medical organizations used the guidelines to administer shots to millions of people, and insurance companies relied on them to determine payment. The recommendations were based on clinical studies and aimed to minimize both individual and societal risk.",
      "But as vaccine hesitancy has skyrocketed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and online misinformation campaigns, vaccination mandates have become a political flashpoint. Distrust in vaccines has created a rift that threatens to split the country into two distinct zones, delineated not by borders or geography but by state governments\u2019 stances on the medical establishment\u2019s right to dictate who must get a jab and who gets a pass.",
      "In an op-ed Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described \u201ccloth masks on toddlers, arbitrary 6-foot distancing, boosters for healthy children, prolonged school closings, economy-crushing lockdowns, and the suppression of low-cost therapeutics in favor of experimental and ineffective drugs\u201d as \u201cirrational\u201d policies that had a \u201cdevastating\u201d toll on Americans.",
      "Lockdowns and school closures certainly had economic and mental health drawbacks, and data suggests that vaccinated and unvaccinated people may transmit the virus at similar rates because they have comparable viral loads \u2014 or amounts of virus in their respiratory tracts \u2014  according to a 2022 paper in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.",
      "However, the vaccines were effective at reducing hospitalizations and the number of severe Covid cases, two factors that overwhelmed health care systems early in the pandemic and precipitated lockdowns in the United States and around the world.",
      "Once Covid vaccines became available at the end of 2020, following intense investment by the first Trump administration, states started to ease lockdowns and social distancing rules.",
      "What didn\u2019t let up \u2014 and still hasn\u2019t \u2014 was the fear around the purported dangers of the new Covid shots, which were developed using a new type of vaccine technology, known as mRNA, that was at once revolutionary but difficult to understand.",
      "The novelty compounded the uncertainties about the long-term health repercussions of a previously unknown virus and the pervasive feelings of loss the pandemic created, including loss of personal freedoms. That created the perfect conditions for divisiveness over vaccinations, Chin-Hong said, and the Covid shots became an easy scapegoat.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is something you could focus on, instead of a general feeling of loss,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy, among the highest-profile figures of the once-small anti-vaccine movement, was confirmed as HHS secretary as he struck a more moderate tone on vaccines, which he has since abandoned.",
      "In June, Kennedy gutted a 17-person independent vaccine advisory committee at the CDC. He replaced the members with a group that included vaccine skeptics and people critical of the Covid vaccines. In early August, he also cut $500 million in mRNA vaccine contracts.",
      "After the FDA approved a new version of the Covid vaccine in May, Kennedy announced that the CDC would recommend that doctors administer the shots only to adults ages 65 and above, as well as people with certain pre-existing conditions. Previously, Covid vaccinations were recommended more widely.",
      "Following that change, the American Academy of Pediatrics took the unusual step of issuing its own vaccination recommendations \u2014 the first time in 30 years its guidelines were significantly different from the federal government\u2019s.",
      "\u201cIt is going to be somewhat confusing. But our opinion is we need to make the right choices for children to protect them,\u201d Dr. James Campbell, vice chair of the academy\u2019s infectious diseases committee, told NBC News.",

      "The governors of California, Oregon and Washington are following in those footsteps, saying they are working to provide unified recommendations to \u201censure residents remain protected by science, not politics.\u201d They warned that there will be severe consequences if the CDC becomes \u201ca political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists \u2014 and his blatant politicization of the agency \u2014 is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people,\u201d the statement said.",
      "HHS criticized Democratic-run states in a statement for pandemic policies that \u201ceroded the American people\u2019s trust in public health agencies.\u201d It also defended the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.",
      "\u201cACIP remains the scientific body guiding immunization recommendations in this country, and HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The news release announcing the West Coast Health Alliance on Wednesday criticized the CDC\u2019s dismantling, saying there is an absence of consistent, science-based federal leadership in public health. It said the alliance\u2019s shared principles will be finalized \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d",
      "Without clarity from the federal government, individual states may begin to craft their own public health orders. New Mexico\u2019s Health Department announced last week that it was ordering pharmacies to \u201cremove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d after some pharmacies said they couldn\u2019t administer the new versions of the Covid shots until the CDC advisory panel met and issued its official guidance.",
      "Insurance companies, which look to the federal government for guidance about what\u2019s covered by health plans, will also be figuring out the changing landscape in coming months.",
      "Vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices are generally free because of provisions in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.",
      "Tina Stow, a spokesperson for the health insurance industry group AHIP, said in a statement that the organization was reviewing the FDA announcement and would monitor upcoming recommendations from the CDC \u201con considerations around coverage,\u201d alongside its members.",
      "\u201cIndividual health plans and plan sponsors will be prepared to make coverage decisions informed by science, the latest medical evidence and data,\u201d she said. \u201cThis process will be evidence-based, evaluate multiple sources of data, including but not limited to ACIP, and will be informed by customer needs.\u201d",
      "Coverage decisions for vaccinations can also hinge on recommendations from medical organizations like the American Association of Pediatrics.",
      "More chaos unfolded at the CDC in recent days after the White House said it was firing Monarez as its director after she refused to resign.

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. heads to Capitol Hill for testimony Thursday, a week after Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired and a series of vaccine-related decisions drew criticism from lawmakers, including Senate health committee chair, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.",
      "Monarez\u2019s firing led several senior CDC officials to resign and fueled a staff protest outside the agency\u2019s Atlanta headquarters last week. In a scathing editorial in The New York Times on Monday, nine former CDC directors called Kennedy \u201cdangerous\u201d and said his actions are \u201cunlike anything our country has ever experienced.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy hope during the hearing is that he\u2019s asked tough questions,\u201d Dr. Richard Besser, who served as acting CDC director in 2009 and was among the former directors who signed the Times editorial, said in an interview. \u201cHow is the country healthier and safer by firing the CDC director?\u201d",
      "Among his recent actions, Kennedy fired all the members of an influential CDC panel that makes recommendations on vaccinations and replaced them with his own handpicked members, some of whom are known anti-vaccine activists. He slashed $500 million in mRNA vaccine research and announced that the Food and Drug Administration had limited this fall\u2019s Covid shot approval to people 65 and up and those with underlying medical conditions.",
      "The moves have prompted outcry, including from more than 1,000 current and former Department of Health and Human Services employees who published a letter Wednesday demanding that Kennedy resign.",
      "Since Monarez\u2019s ouster, Kennedy has largely steered clear of public questioning.",
      "On Tuesday, Kennedy defended the direction he has taken the public health agency in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, saying that he is working to restore public trust and protect the public from infectious disease threats.",
      "\u201cThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was once the world\u2019s most trusted guardian of public health,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cBut over the decades, bureaucratic inertia, politicized science and mission creep have corroded that purpose and squandered public trust.\u201d",
      "Besser, who is now CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said, \"How do you protect the nation from threats when you move to eliminate some of the leading experts in disease prevention and health promotion?\u201d",
      "A key test",
      "Thursday\u2019s hearing before the Senate Finance Committee is not only a key test for Kennedy, but for Cassidy, the pivotal vote behind his confirmation. (In addition to chairing the health committee, which oversees the CDC, Cassidy is also a member of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over HHS.)",
      "After publicly wavering, Cassidy announced he would support Kennedy and highlighted a series of promises he said he had secured, including that Kennedy would maintain a key vaccine advisory committee without changes and that he\u2019d given Cassidy assurances about \u201cprotecting the public health benefit of vaccination,\u201d among other things. (Kennedy subsequently fired everyone on the vaccine committee and made false claims about vaccines amid the country\u2019s largest measles outbreak in 33 years.)",
      "In May, Cassidy told NBC News that Kennedy had \u201clived up\u201d to those promises even as critics raised concerns that he was chipping away at public faith in vaccines.",
      "This week, Cassidy was mum about what he planned to ask Kennedy on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t decided that,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. \u201cBut I want to carefully frame the question. The issue is about children\u2019s health, and there\u2019s rumors, allegations, that children\u2019s health, which is at issue here, might be endangered by some of the decisions that are purported to be made.\u201d",
      "Asked about the allegations from the CDC officials who resigned last week that Kennedy was putting his political agenda over science, Cassidy said: \u201cSo shouldn\u2019t we find that out? You don\u2019t presuppose they\u2019re right, you don\u2019t presuppose they\u2019re wrong. You go out in a way in which both sides get a chance to say, and then we can judge. And so that\u2019s my hope.\u201d",
      "Cassidy, who faces a primary challenge from his right flank next year amid criticism that he hasn\u2019t stood by President Donald Trump enough, has raised concerns on social media in recent weeks about the CDC turmoil as well as the mRNA funding cuts.",
      "In the wake of Monarez\u2019s dismissal, Cassidy also diverged from Kennedy by urging the agency to \u201cindefinitely\u201d postpone a meeting of the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory committee scheduled for this month.",
      "\u201cSerious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed for the now announced September ACIP meeting,\u201d Cassidy said in a statement, referring to the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. \u201cIf the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership.\u201d",
      "HHS hasn\u2019t said whether it\u2019s considering delaying the meeting.",
      "\u201cI commend him [Cassidy] on calling for them to suspend that hearing,\u201d Besser said. \u201cAs a physician and a senator and as a chair of the HELP Committee, people will be looking at him for his take on the Secretary.\u201d",
      "Cassidy\u2019s recent decision to ring the alarm bells over some of Kennedy\u2019s decisions heightens the stakes for Thursday\u2019s hearing in front of the Finance Committee. While Democrats, who have long warned that Kennedy shouldn\u2019t be leading HHS over his views on subjects like vaccines, are expected to lay into him, it\u2019s unclear whether the secretary will face any real pressure from senators from his adopted party, particularly Cassidy.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Cassidy declined to elaborate after he said he would conduct \u201coversight\u201d of Kennedy and the recent shake-up at the CDC. He wouldn\u2019t answer when asked if he regretted his vote for Kennedy or had confidence in him.",
      "Cassidy\u2019s skepticism is important not just because of his health chairmanship, but because he\u2019s trusted on the issue by fellow Republicans on the Finance Committee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m interested to hear more about it,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who is also juggling Senate duties with a contested re-election primary for 2026. \u201cAnd my sort of north star is Senator Cassidy, and so I\u2019ll be interested in what he has to say.\u201d",
      "Cornyn, who is facing his own primary from a Republican trying to frame him as insufficiently conservative, said he\u2019s still mulling what to ask Kennedy at the hearing Thursday.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who sits on the health committee, backed Cassidy\u2019s call for oversight and questioned Kennedy\u2019s decision-making on public health matters.",
      "\u201cWe want to have this based on science,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, it just doesn\u2019t feel that way.\u201d",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who is not running for re-election and  sits on the Finance Committee, also said he\u2019s taking cues from Cassidy on how to approach Kennedy.",
      "\u201cWhatever Bill Cassidy is saying is pretty much me,\u201d Tillis said Wednesday.",
      "And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters that the CDC needs \u201cstability\u201d amid the flurry of departures.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in charge of the department and he needs to restore public trust in the CDC,\u201d Thune said of Kennedy.",
      "\u201cWhoever ends up in that position, it shouldn\u2019t be disqualifying to be in support or in favor of vaccines.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe have reason to believe that Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,\u201d Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said at a news conference Tuesday, referring to the senior White House aide who has been credited with driving President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. The governor added that he\u2019s \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that officials will specifically target the celebrations and Latino communities.",
      "Officials and advocates in Boston are also preparing for any attempt by Trump to ramp up immigration enforcement after Politico published a report Friday indicating Trump was preparing for an immigration crackdown in the city. NBC News hasn\u2019t independently verified the report, which cites an unnamed current and a former administration official.",
      "Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey told NBC News in a statement Wednesday that \u201cwhat we are seeing from Donald Trump across the country isn\u2019t about public safety \u2014 it\u2019s about political intimidation.\u201d",
      "While there aren\u2019t yet concrete indications of exactly when additional law enforcement could be expected in those cities, immigration enforcement has gone hand in hand with the Trump administration\u2019s sending National Guard troops to Los Angeles and in the federal takeover of Washington, D.C. Trump said late Tuesday that he would be \u201cgoing in\u201d to Chicago and that he had a right to go into the city to \u201cprotect this country.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has said the operations are necessary to bring down crime, although statistics show crime has been down in cities, including Los Angeles, Washington and now Chicago and Boston.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that it will \u201cgo to wherever these criminal illegal aliens are\u2014including Chicago and Boston. Under President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem, nowhere is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.\u201d",
      "Pritzker, a Democrat, said Trump was positioning armed federal agents on federal property in the Chicago region and warned that he would send masked agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u201cplanning to raid Latino communities.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the coming days, we expect to see what has played out in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., to happen here in Chicago, Illinois,\u201d he said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cNone of this is about fighting crime or making Chicago safer. For Trump, it\u2019s about testing his power and producing a political drama to cover up his corruption,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cWe are ready to fight troop deployments in court, and we will do everything possible to ensure that agents operating inside the confines of this state do so in a legal and ethical manner.\u201d",
      "Brandon Lee, the director of communications for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said the advocacy group\u2019s focus was on making sure its rapid response teams were ready, increasing the hours and staffing on its ICE enforcement hotline, providing information to people about their rights and connecting them to legal and social services.",
      "\u201cWe are using this moment to promote the hotline, to make sure rapid response teams are prepared, and when the moment comes making sure that there is joint pushback against the Trump administration\u2019s overreach,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been employing new tactics to disrupt our communities and separate families. We\u2019re just ready to be nimble.\u201d",
      "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said alongside Pritzker on Tuesday that violence in the city \u201cis not because we have too many immigrants, it\u2019s because we have too many guns.\u201d",
      "Johnson signed an executive order Saturday aimed at curbing the power of federal law enforcement officers and National Guard troops should Trump send them to Chicago. One of the main points of the order, Johnson said, was to direct the city\u2019s Law Department to use \u201cevery legal mechanism\u201d to try to stop Trump\u2019s potential plan.",
      "The executive order also clarifies what actions police officers can take to assist federal law enforcement and says the police department won\u2019t collaborate with military personnel or civil immigration enforcement.",
      "Sophia Zaman, the executive director of the Raise the Floor Alliance, said its members have been checking in with leaders and flyering work sites, doing peer outreach and working \u201carm in arm\u201d with other advocacy groups to prepare. Raise the Floor Alliance is a coalition of worker centers, including in immigrant communities where people are \u201cdeeply impacted by the administration\u2019s policies,\u201d she said.",

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Federal agents are violating a court order that prohibits them from racially profiling Latinos and other Southern California residents as the directive winds it way through an appeals process, immigrant advocates and local officials say.",
      "U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, a Biden-era appointee, imposed the temporary restraining order in Los Angeles more than a month ago, but arrests in locations frequented by Latino workers, such as Home Depots and car washes, have become daily occurrences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a complete disregard,\u201d said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the rounding up of cattle in the road.\u201d",
      "The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, denies racially profiling people in its efforts to carry out President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda.",
      "\u201cUnelected judges are undermining the will of the American people,\" DHS said Wednesday in an emailed statement. \"What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. \u2014 NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.\u201d",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and Public Counsel, which filed the original lawsuit in July, filed a new motion Tuesday asking Frimpong to order additional evidence from the federal government \u201cin light of apparent violations\u201d of her order.",
      "\u201cThis limited discovery is needed to determine whether further action may be necessary to enforce the Court\u2019s TRO and to inform what additional measures, if any, may be needed to ensure compliance with any preliminary injunction the Court may issue,\u201d the motion reads.",
      "It details six arrests in August \u2014 three at Home Depots and three at car washes in Los Angeles County \u2014 that appear to undermine the temporary restraining order.",
      "In one instance, on Aug. 22, federal agents detained seven people at a Pasadena car wash, including a legal resident, according to the motion. The man was handcuffed and detained despite having proper documentation nearby, the motion said. He was later released but described the incident as \u201cdevastating and humiliating.\u201d",
      "Frustrated by the lengthy court battle, immigrant rights' organizers say communities are being torn apart while lawyers file motion after motion. But local officials say the order has been difficult to enforce while litigation remains ongoing.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re using every tool at our disposal to put a stop to this behavior,\u201d said Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto.",
      "Last month, Soto's office led a coalition of 20 California cities \u2014 including Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Long Beach \u2014 in joining a federal lawsuit alleging that the federal government conducted unconstitutional and unlawful arrests and raids without reasonable suspicion or probable cause.",
      "The organizations asked the court to stop federal agencies from using \u201cdisproportionate force,\u201d which has sometimes led to U.S. citizens being detained.",
      "The federal government twice challenged the temporary restraining order, first in the 9th U.S. Circuit of Appeals and then in the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling was upheld in the appeals court, and the Supreme Court has not weighed in on the issue.",
      "The lawsuit is set for a hearing on Sept. 24 for a preliminary injunction that would extend the order as the case progresses through the courts.",
      "Meanwhile, immigration advocates said they recorded more than a dozen arrests at Home Depots and car washes in Los Angeles and Orange counties Tuesday.",
      "Volunteers who witnessed the arrests or went to the scene to help families get information about their missing loved ones said the workers all spoke Spanish.",
      "Eight people were arrested last week outside a Home Depot near a day labor center, which has been the target of at least three previous enforcement actions, NBC Los Angeles reported.",
      "Video shot by immigration advocates and circulated on social media shows federal agents arriving in unmarked cars as workers run, some tripping over themselves.",

      "\u201cEvery day, DHS is enforcing our nation\u2019s laws across all of LA not just Home Depots,\u201d the department said in Wednesday's emailed statement.",

      "Joshua Erazo, a day laborer organizer who connects workers with employers at the center, told NBC Los Angeles that the people who were detained included street vendors.",
      "Data compiled by CHIRLA shows that 471 of the 2,800 arrests made by the Department of Homeland Security from June 6 to July 20 occurred in predominantly Latino neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley.",
      "As of Wednesday, Homeland Security has made more than 5,000 arrests in Los Angeles, \"including murderers, rapists, and child abusers,\" it said in the statement.",
      "Believing they have little recourse, some residents have filed individual lawsuits instead of waiting for the temporary restraining order to be enforced.",

They filed a claim for $1 million in damages for personal injury, including \"assault, battery, false arrest, false imprisonment,\" according to court documents.",
      "Andreina Mejia said she and her son, who is 15 and has special needs, were sitting inside her parked car outside Arleta High School when masked federal agents approached them with guns drawn. They were both pulled out and Mejia was handcuffed while agents questioned her son, she said.",

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., wrote in a letter Wednesday to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.",
      "\u201cOf particular relevance for this Committee is that the men and women serving in our Armed Forces are trained primarily for warfighting, not community policing and safeguarding civil liberties. Unlawfully and unnecessarily deploying troops to engage in law enforcement in local communities, instead of the duties they are trained for, undermines military readiness and endangers American communities,\u201d he added.",
      "Durbin contended that police power to ensure residents\u2019 safety is a duty that rests with state and local officials, not the federal government.",
      "\u201cThe recent threats by the President to send troops or federal officers into American cities to address local crime or other issues within state control over the objection of state officials imperil this foundational principle and the rights of all states,\u201d Durbin wrote.",

Trump suggested Wednesday that he could send federal troops to New Orleans.",

      "The Trump administration is warning would-be drug traffickers that they will meet the same fate as those killed in a boat the U.S blew up Tuesday in the southern Caribbean, a dramatic escalation in the drug war and the White House's bitter feud with Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\u201cVenezuela has been a very bad actor,\u201d President Donald Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office.",
      "The U.S.\u2019s offensive posture in the region is raising questions about its ultimate goal \u2014 and how U.S. intelligence agencies were so certain that the boat contained drugs and members of the notorious Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "\u201cWe have tapes of them speaking,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Though the president\u2019s specific intentions regarding Maduro are unclear, the U.S. seems to have two objectives: stemming the flow of illegal drugs from Venezuela and placing debilitating pressure on the Venezuelan leader.",
      "The goal is to force Maduro to make rash decisions that could ultimately lead to his ouster \u2014 without American boots on the ground \u2014 according to a source familiar with the Trump administration\u2019s thinking.",
      "A second source familiar said that last week the administration privately signaled plans to intensify pressure on Venezuela, saying the situation was about to quickly escalate and that Maduro \u201chad a lot to worry about.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be more to come\u201d with regard to hitting drug cartel operations, the source said.",
      "In 2019, during Trump\u2019s first term, his administration recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim president while Maduro faced mass protests after years of hyperinflation and a string of blackouts. Despite the U.S. backing of Guaid\u00f3, Maduro held onto power.",
      "Last month, some members of the Venezuelan opposition movement visited the State Department for meetings with top officials, according to two people familiar with the talks.",
      "Rubio's role",
      "Marco Rubio has long been a hardliner on Venezuela, as a senator, as a presidential candidate, and now as secretary of state as well as national security advisor.",
      "The source familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking believes regime change in Venezuela has been Rubio\u2019s goal. The administration is preparing for this by not recognizing Maduro as a legitimate president, accusing him of rigging elections and  alleging he\u2019s a narco-terrorist, the head of the Cartel de Los Soles. Several weeks ago, the U.S. doubled its reward for information leading to Maduro\u2019s arrest to $50 million.",
      "The source familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking said the U.S. hopes that ramping up pressure on Maduro may prompt finger-pointing inside Venezuela and lead cartel bosses inside and outside the country to blame Maduro and force him out. The source speculated that Russia \u2014 not wanting to get involved in a domestic power struggle \u2014 would pull its financial, diplomatic and military support from Venezuela, long considered its ally.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s military strike on the alleged drug smuggling boat, which Trump said killed 11 people and did not hurt U.S. forces, came as a surprise to many members of Congress.",
      "Democrats, even those in leadership positions on relevant oversight committees, have not been provided with any information about the strike, according to multiple congressional officials with direct knowledge of the situation. It\u2019s not clear what information, if any, Republicans were given before or after the strike.",
      "Rubio defended the strike on Wednesday while visiting Mexico, arguing that the typical interdiction procedures that the U.S. Coast Guard conducts to arrest drug smugglers didn\u2019t work in these cases.",
      "\u201cThese drug cartels, what they do is they know they\u2019re going to lose 2% of their cargo,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThey bake it into their economics. What will stop them is when you blow them up.\u201d",
      "Additional U.S. military forces",
      "Last month, the U.S. began sending more military resources, including three guided-missile destroyers, to the southern Caribbean. Stephen Donehoo, a former military intelligence officer specializing in Latin America, told NBC News the deployment was enormous.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen this much U.S. naval military force in the Caribbean under the command of the Southern Command in decades,\u201d Donehoo said. \u201cAll these ships have intelligence systems, and they are also armed to carry out this type of attack if necessary.\u201d",
      "In the last few weeks, Maduro has claimed the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean is aimed at overthrowing his government. He has deployed troops along the border while calling on thousands of civilians to join armed militias to defend the nation.",
      "A senior White House official downplayed any possibility of the U.S. invading Venezuela, but said, \u201cYou can expect to see the president use any means necessary to tackle drug cartels.\u201d",
      "On Fox News Wednesday morning, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was asked about whether the administration\u2019s goal was regime change in Venezuela. Notably, he did not rule it out.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a presidential decision,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "The second source familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking dismissed any threat posed by Venezuela\u2019s troops and expressed skepticism that the country\u2019s armed forces would remain loyal to Maduro.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a house of cards,\u201d the source added, speculating that Maduro would see the writing on the wall and flee the country, perhaps to Cuba.",
      "Maduro pushback",
      "For its part, the Maduro government has escalated its criticism of the White House, even claiming the video of Tuesday\u2019s attack on the alleged drug trafficking boat was created using AI.",
      "\u201cI can tell you that was definitely not artificial intelligence,\u201d Hegseth said in the Fox interview. \u201cI watched it live.\u201d",
      "In comments broadcast on Venezuelan state television Tuesday night, Maduro alluded to what he considered Rubio\u2019s significant power within the Trump administration regarding Venezuela policy.",
      "\u201cThe youth of the United States do not believe the lies of the big shot in the White House, Marco Rubio,\" Maduro said. \"Because who runs the White House is Marco Rubio \u2014 the mafia of Miami \u2014 who wants to fill Donald Trump\u2019s hands with blood.\u201d",
      "More actions expected",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s strike against the cartel boat may only be the beginning of its actions in the region.",
      "In February, the State Department designated eight drug cartels and criminal organizations as foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists. That gave the White House new legal authorities to take military action against such groups throughout the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Asked about the cartels in an interview last month, Rubio said it was time they were treated \u201cas armed terrorist organizations, not simply drug -dealing organizations.\u201d",
      "The Secretary of State said the new designations would allow the Trump administration to target the cartel\u2019s operations using other elements of American power, including U.S. intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense.",
      "\u201cIt is a criminal enterprise \u2014 all the way to the various cartels that operate in Mexico, and in between,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo, what it changes is it gives us legal authorities to target them in ways you can\u2019t do if they\u2019re just a bunch of criminals. It\u2019s no longer a law enforcement issue. It becomes a national security issue.\u201d",

      "Of all the crappy ways smartphones have affected our health, this one is a real kick in the pants.",
      "A first-of-its-kind study links excessive scrolling on the phone while sitting on the toilet with hemorrhoids.",
      "(Insert poo emojis.)",
      "But, seriously. Sitting on an open bowl offers no support for the pelvic floor. That puts pressure on veins in the rectum, making them swollen and inflamed.",
      "\u201cThe longer you sit on the toilet, the worse it is for you,\u201d said Dr. Trisha Pasricha, director of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center\u2019s Institute for Gut-Brain Research Institute in Boston. Pasricha is also an author of the study, which was published Wednesday in PLOS One.",
      "And smartphones are designed to keep people fixated for as long as possible. \u201cThey\u2019re completely consuming to us in ways that wasn\u2019t happening to the casual bathroom reader in the 80s,\u201d Pasricha said. \u201cThey could much more easily put the newspaper down and get up and leave.\u201d",
      "Pasricha and colleagues surveyed 125 adults just before they were about to have a routine colonoscopy to screen for colorectal cancer.",
      "Eighty-three (66%) of the participants admitted to using their phones in the bathroom \u2014 mostly to catch up on news of the day and scroll through social media.",
      "Gastroenterologists performing the colonoscopies looked for evidence of inflamed veins, or hemorrhoids. People who said they took their phone into the bathroom were 46% more likely to have hemorrhoids compared to the others.",
      "The risk remained even when researchers accounted for other factors associated with hemorrhoids, including dietary fiber, exercise and constipation or straining while using the toilet.",
      "Hemorrhoids aren\u2019t necessarily dangerous, but they can be bothersome, itchy and even painful. They also bleed sometimes, understandably causing concern and leading to nearly 4 million doctor\u2019s office and emergency department visits a year.",
      "Over time, \u201cpelvic floor dysfunction can also lead to incontinence, worsen constipation and be associated with rectal pain,\u201d said Dr. Reezwana Chowdhury, an inflammatory bowel disorder specialist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Chowdhury was not involved with the new research.",
      "What\u2019s more, microscopic particles from urine and feces are sent flying through the air when a toilet is flushed. Taking a phone into the bathroom, Chowdhury said, \u201cis kind of gross.\u201d",
      "Younger patients",
      "In the new study, smartphone users in the bathroom tended to be younger, meaning adults in their 40s and 50s, versus people over age 60.",
      "Dr. Robert Cima, a colorectal surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said he\u2019s noticed an uptick in recent years of people coming in with hemorrhoids.",
      "\u201cI am seeing younger, earlier- and middle-aged people having more hemorrhoidal complaints, but I can\u2019t tie it to smartphones,\u201d said Cima, who was not involved with the new study. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re using smartphones or they have better access to care or they\u2019re not eating appropriately.\u201d",
      "The 5-minute rule",
      "The experts agreed that business on the toilet should take no longer than 5 minutes.",
      "More than 37% of study participants who used a smartphone in the bathroom stayed for longer than that, compared to 7% of people who kept their phones out of the bathroom.",
      "Pasricha and other experts do not advocate for taking a phone into the bathroom. If you absolutely must, set a timer.",

      "Goodell also addressed the potential for the Super Bowl to be moved to a different date. While the game has been played in February for several years, there has been chatter around the idea of making the day after it a holiday so people don\u2019t have to go into work after staying up late. That has some fans pushing for the game to be played over Presidents Day weekend.",

      "\u201cI think if you went to 18 weeks regular season, that would probably occur,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible somewhere in the calendar, could happen before that, just because of the calendar it lays out. But I think 18 weeks would get you to that point. I think it\u2019d be a really great move.\u201d",

Toward the end of the three-and-a-half-hour interview, hosts Will Compton and Taylor Lewan, fellow former professional football players, asked Jason Kelce about welcoming Swift into the Kelce family.",
      "\u201cWell, I think first of all, I love my brother. I just want him to have, like, the most fulfilled, best life possible,\u201d Jason Kelce responded. \u201cAnd such a huge part of that is, like, you know, who you end up marrying, who you end up raising a family with.\u201d",

      "He also said that Swift appreciates qualities in the Kansas City Chiefs star that he admires, as well. The former Philadelphia Eagle referenced Swift\u2019s recent appearance on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast, in which she described her beau as a \u201chuman exclamation point.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe \u2018human exclamation point\u2019 was, like, the best way I\u2019ve ever heard Travis described in my life. I think it\u2019s, like, such an accurate statement. The dude just brings joy to every place he ever is and, like, people love him and he makes everything better,\u201d Jason Kelce praised. \u201cTo watch them support each other, love each other and get to this stage and now to have this together, I\u2019m just, I mean, I\u2019m very happy for them.\u201d",

      "The proud big brother answered, \u201cNo\u2026I never lost, like, hope that that would happen. I think (it was) just, you know, you\u2019re young, you\u2019re having fun, you\u2019re figuring things out.\u201d",

He\u2019s a great person. He\u2019s unselfish. Everything he does, I think, would lead to him finding somebody that would want to be with him for all the right reasons and more.\u201d",
      "The Grammy winner and Travis Kelce announced their engagement news on Instagram Aug. 26 with a series of photos from their romantic proposal.",

      "Nearby, four young boys lay lifeless on the floor, their faces spattered with blood as a pool of crimson red formed around one of their heads. Screams rang out around them as more children were rushed into Nasser Hospital, in southern Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis, crying out and covered in blood.",
      "In separate video captured by a witness and shared with NBC News, several people, including children, lie bloodied by water jugs near a fountain as others race to help them.

      "The deadly attack in an area considered a humanitarian zone unfolded as Israel began to mobilize tens of thousands of reservists to launch an expanded assault on Gaza City, forcing thousands of people to flee south.",
      "The Israeli military initially told NBC News on Tuesday it had no record of strikes in the area of Al-Mawasi that day. Asked for an update Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces said a strike targeting a \u201ckey\u201d Hamas member was conducted in western Khan Younis but did not provide further details. It said it was aware of reports of casualties as a result of the strike, adding that the incident was under review.",
      "The incident unfolded within hours of a statement from the Israeli military's Arabic language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, telling Palestinians in Gaza that \"enhanced services\" were being provided in Al-Mawasi, \"with an emphasis on access to medical care, water and food.\"",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 As British detectives studied the grainy CCTV video of the burning warehouse, there was at first little reason to think they were looking at a covert Russian intelligence operation.",
      "The March 2024 video from the Cromwell Industrial Estate in east London showed two masked men pouring gasoline outside the warehouse door, setting it ablaze with a burning rag, and then fleeing into the night.",
      "The fact that the storage facility belonged to a Ukrainian logistics company that was shipping humanitarian aid and Starlink satellite internet dishes to Ukraine did not initially raise any alarms.",
      "But 10 days later when a warehouse belonging to the same company was set on fire in Spain\u2019s capital Madrid, detectives realized it was much bigger than a simple case of arson.",
      "The investigation and the prosecution that followed would shed light on what Western officials have warned is a dangerous Russian tactic: hiring local criminals to carry out acts of sabotage across Europe.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new thing to see criminal proxies used on behalf of foreign states,\u201d Cmdr. Dominic Murphy, the head of the counter-terrorism unit at London\u2019s Metropolitan Police, told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News\u2019 international partner, in July. \u201cWe have seen this trend developing over the last year or two, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll continue to see it develop over the next year or so.\u201d",
      "Over the last year, NATO governments have accused Russian intelligence agencies of remotely recruiting criminals and using them to sow chaos.",
      "The exact number of attacks is difficult to quantify. The allegations range from Britain to Estonia to the Czech Republic to Poland \u2014 where, authorities say, Russia paid a group to burn down the country\u2019s biggest shopping mall in May 2024.",
      "Moscow denies all allegations of sabotage, including in the case in London. \u201cRussia has never engaged in sabotage activities against the United Kingdom and has no intention of doing so,\u201d the Russian Embassy in the United Kingdom said in a statement.",
      "Calvin Bailey, a British member of Parliament who sits on the Defense Select Committee, said the London attack fit a pattern in which Russian operatives used encrypted apps and cryptocurrency to hire criminals as they tried to mask their own involvement.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re incentivized by money but the use of Telegram and bitcoin creates plausible deniability and allows the Russians to keep their distance,\u201d Bailey said in a recent interview. \u201cIt hides the trail, be that a money trail or any of the connections.\u201d",
      "According to British prosecutors the trail that led to the warehouse burning in east London began in March 2024, when a 21-year-old British drug dealer named Dylan Earl initiated communications with an anonymous account on Telegram with the usernames \u201cPrivet Bot\u201d and \u201cLucky Strike.\u201d",
      "The account was run by an operative with the Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group that fought in Syria and Ukraine before it launched a short-lived mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2023 but has now been brought to heel by the Kremlin.",
      "Earl expressed interest in joining Wagner as a gun-for-hire, saying, \u201cI need a fresh start\u201d after his life of small-time crime in the U.K, according to documents released by prosecutors.",
      "But the Russian handler said Wagner had a different use for him: carrying out operations in Europe.",
      "Over the course of hundreds of messages, the Russian handler offered the young British criminal both money and ideological encouragement to burn down the warehouse, which could net him roughly $8,000.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll make you rich. And grant you things no one else can. Citizenships. Passports. Everything,\u201d the Russian handler said in a message posted on the Privet Bot account.  In another, the handler said, \u201cYou are our dagger in Europe.\u201d",
      "Earl was also encouraged to embrace a clandestine lifestyle by watching the FX show \u201cThe Americans\u201d about KGB spies operating undercover in the United States.",
      "\u201cLook how they describe Russia. But you see U.K. and USA,\u201d the handler wrote.  \u201cHomeless everywhere. Drugs etc. It is fearmongering bro. They want people scared.\u201d",
      "Earl knew he was dealing with a Wagner operative but did not back down.",
      "Within weeks of their initial messages, Earl had recruited a group of young accomplices to carry out the warehouse attack. According to prosecutors, only one of them \u2014 Jake Reeves, 23 \u2014 understood that they were starting the fire on Russian orders.",
      "Neither Earl nor Reeves was present when the fire was started by Nii Kojo Mensah, 23, Jakeem Rose, 21, and Ugnius Asmena, 23, all of whom were convicted of aggravated arson. Instead, they watched a livestream of the blaze on FaceTime provided by Asmena.",
      "The men who actually started the fire believed it was merely a criminal act \u2014 Earl never told them they were acting on Russian orders.",
      "British detectives stepped up the hunt after they realized they were most likely dealing with a Russian state-sponsored operation targeting the Ukrainian business. They arrested Earl in early April and after they accessed his phone, quickly established his connection to the Wagner group.",
      "Earl and Reeves both pleaded guilty to aggravated arson and offenses under British national security laws.",
      "There is no suggestion that they were linked to other attacks across Europe or the groups carrying them out.",
      "\u201cThis case is a clear example of an organization linked to the Russian state using 'proxies' \u2014 in this case British men \u2014 to carry out very serious criminal activity in this country on their behalf,\u201d Murphy, the Met counterterrorism head, said in a statement after the verdict.",
      "The suspected Russian-backed criminal attacks across Europe are usually unsophisticated intelligence operations. Many of the plots, like the one in London, involve arson.",
      "In June, a Colombian man was imprisoned for eight years in the Czech Republic after he was convicted of setting fire to buses in Prague. Like Earl, he was also given orders by a Russian handler over the Telegram messaging app and told to record himself setting the fire, according to Czech authorities.",
      "That type of attack is relatively low-risk for Russia, compared with sending its own professional agents into an increasingly hostile Europe.",
      "But there is some evidence that the Russian operative handling Earl had higher ambitions for his group of British gangsters-for-hire.",
      "British police said that at the time of their arrest they had already begun surveillance operations for their next plot: kidnapping a Russian dissident named Yevgeny Chichvarkin and setting fire to his Michelin-starred Hide restaurant in one of London\u2019s most expensive neighborhoods."

      "\u201cAnd I hope that\u2019s paid off in spades, because we love this community,\u201d he said, sitting in front of a screen with a live ticker showing the cryptocurrency\u2019s price at nearly $110,000, up from about $70,000 on the day his father, Donald Trump, was voted back into office in November.",
      "Eric Trump has attracted an almost cult-like following in the crypto industry, which was apparent in Hong Kong as hundreds of attendees \u2014 some dressed up in outfits ranging from sparkly robes to white suits covered in Bitcoin symbols \u2014 cheered as Trump took the stage, bashed his father\u2019s predecessor, Joe Biden, and said, \u201cThis is the time to buy.\u201d",
      "The cryptocurrency industry has become big business for the Trump family, whose patriarch has become one of its biggest champions since it helped return him to office.",
      "Feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, the industry was a political force in the 2024 election season, directing an estimated $135 million in donations toward Trump and other crypto-friendly candidates.",

      "Eric Trump said Friday that the company will be going public \u201cvery soon\u201d as it merges with a pre-existing Nasdaq-listed company called Gryphon Digital Mining.",
      "\u201cWe are one of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies on Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe mine about 3% of the world\u2019s Bitcoin every single day.\u201d",
      "He insists that the family\u2019s business is separate from national politics and has dismissed concerns about conflicts of interest.",

      "But Donald Trump was a major topic of discussion at his son\u2019s Q&A in Hong Kong, which began with a round of applause for the president, who has vowed to make the United States the \u201ccrypto capital of the world.\u201d",
      "Since returning to office in January, Trump has pushed to ease regulation of the industry, shut down the Justice Department\u2019s national cryptocurrency enforcement team, appointed a \u201ccrypto czar\u201d and held a White House summit for industry leaders. He also said the U.S. would create a national strategic crypto reserve.",
      "This month he signed an executive order allowing cryptocurrency and real estate investments to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts, which critics say could put Americans\u2019 retirement savings at risk.",
      "Trump has also sought legislative backing for a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, some of which is already in place. One of the three bills that received support on Capitol Hill last month was the GENIUS Act, which allows stablecoins to be issued by private companies.",
      "The passage of the bills was slammed by Americans for Financial Reform, a left-leaning watchdog group, which said in a statement last month that Trump and his allies would \u201cpersonally benefit from limitless legalized corruption while the rest of us stand in harm\u2019s way of the next crypto implosion.\u201d",
      "Trump, who said in 2021 that Bitcoin \u201cseems like a scam,\u201d has since embraced it as a moneymaking opportunity, sometimes at great cost to investors. According to the watchdog group State Democracy Defenders Fund, as of mid-March his crypto assets were valued at $2.9 billion, or about 37% of his total wealth.",
      "Much of that money, which Trump earned in about six months, came from ventures such as the $TRUMP coin that he launched ahead of his inauguration, which was trading at nearly $8 on Friday, down from its peak of $73 in January. A meme coin was also launched for first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Industry professionals call these meme coins, meaning they have little practical use and are mostly symbolic, making their value subject to extreme volatility. About 764,000 wallets of mostly small holders lost money on $TRUMP while 58 wallets made more than $10 million each, CNBC reported in May, citing data from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.",
      "In May, Trump briefly appeared at a dinner outside Washington for the 220 largest buyers of $TRUMP, who spent an average of $1 million on the token.",

      "The U.S.\u2019s offensive posture in the region is raising questions about its ultimate goal \u2014 and how U.S. intelligence agencies were so certain that the boat contained drugs and members of the notorious Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "\u201cWe have tapes of them speaking,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Though the president\u2019s specific intentions regarding Maduro are unclear, the U.S. seems to have two objectives: stemming the flow of illegal drugs from Venezuela and placing debilitating pressure on the Venezuelan leader.",
      "The goal is to force Maduro to make rash decisions that could ultimately lead to his ouster \u2014 without American boots on the ground \u2014 according to a source familiar with the Trump administration\u2019s thinking.",
      "A second source familiar said that last week the administration privately signaled plans to intensify pressure on Venezuela, saying the situation was about to quickly escalate and that Maduro \u201chad a lot to worry about.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be more to come\u201d with regard to hitting drug cartel operations, the source said.",
      "In 2019, during Trump\u2019s first term, his administration recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim president while Maduro faced mass protests after years of hyperinflation and a string of blackouts. Despite the U.S. backing of Guaid\u00f3, Maduro held onto power.",

      "The source familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking believes regime change in Venezuela has been Rubio\u2019s goal. The administration is preparing for this by not recognizing Maduro as a legitimate president, accusing him of rigging elections and  alleging he\u2019s a narco-terrorist, the head of the Cartel de Los Soles. Several weeks ago, the U.S. doubled its reward for information leading to Maduro\u2019s arrest to $50 million.",
      "The source familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking said the U.S. hopes that ramping up pressure on Maduro may prompt finger-pointing inside Venezuela and lead cartel bosses inside and outside the country to blame Maduro and force him out. The source speculated that Russia \u2014 not wanting to get involved in a domestic power struggle \u2014 would pull its financial, diplomatic and military support from Venezuela, long considered its ally.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s military strike on the alleged drug smuggling boat, which Trump said killed 11 people and did not hurt U.S. forces, came as a surprise to many members of Congress.",
      "Democrats, even those in leadership positions on relevant oversight committees, have not been provided with any information about the strike, according to multiple congressional officials with direct knowledge of the situation. It\u2019s not clear what information, if any, Republicans were given before or after the strike.",
      "Rubio defended the strike on Wednesday while visiting Mexico, arguing that the typical interdiction procedures that the U.S. Coast Guard conducts to arrest drug smugglers didn\u2019t work in these cases.",
      "\u201cThese drug cartels, what they do is they know they\u2019re going to lose 2% of their cargo,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThey bake it into their economics. What will stop them is when you blow them up.\u201d",
      "Additional U.S. military forces",
      "Last month, the U.S. began sending more military resources, including three guided-missile destroyers, to the southern Caribbean. Stephen Donehoo, a former military intelligence officer specializing in Latin America, told NBC News the deployment was enormous.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen this much U.S. naval military force in the Caribbean under the command of the Southern Command in decades,\u201d Donehoo said. \u201cAll these ships have intelligence systems, and they are also armed to carry out this type of attack if necessary.\u201d",
      "In the last few weeks, Maduro has claimed the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean is aimed at overthrowing his government. He has deployed troops along the border while calling on thousands of civilians to join armed militias to defend the nation.",
      "A senior White House official downplayed any possibility of the U.S. invading Venezuela, but said, \u201cYou can expect to see the president use any means necessary to tackle drug cartels.\u201d",

      "In comments broadcast on Venezuelan state television Tuesday night, Maduro alluded to what he considered Rubio\u2019s significant power within the Trump administration regarding Venezuela policy.",
      "\u201cThe youth of the United States do not believe the lies of the big shot in the White House, Marco Rubio,\" Maduro said. \"Because who runs the White House is Marco Rubio \u2014 the mafia of Miami \u2014 who wants to fill Donald Trump\u2019s hands with blood.\u201d",
      "More actions expected",

      "In February, the State Department designated eight drug cartels and criminal organizations as foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists.

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 02:10:22 GMT",
    "summary": "A federal appeals court ruled that the president does not have the authority to set sweeping tariffs under the emergency-powers law he invoked.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to quickly decide whether he has the power to impose broad tariffs under a law designed for use during times of emergency.",
      "The Justice Department is appealing a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday that President Donald Trump had exceeded his authority, the filings said.",
      "The filings, shared by the Justice Department and the challengers, have not yet been officially docketed by the Supreme Court.",
      "Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer for the Liberty Justice Center \u2014 which is representing businesses challenging the tariffs \u2014 said in a statement he was confident the court would rule against Trump.",
      "\u201cThese unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,\u201d he added.",
      "The appeals court, divided 7-4, said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate imports when there is a national emergency, does not give sweeping powers to impose global tariffs of unspecified duration.",
      "The tariffs are in effect and will remain in place until at least Oct. 14 under the appeals court ruling.",
      "The administration submitted two filings: an appeal and a motion to expedite.",
      "In the latter, Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to fast-track consideration of the case so oral arguments can be heard as soon as the first week of November. That would require the court to decide by next week whether to hear the case.",
      "The challengers have agreed to that timeline, a Liberty Justice Center spokesman said.",
      "The appeals court's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President\u2019s efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "The filings included a declaration by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent citing the importance of a quick ruling.",
      "\"Swift review of that decision is necessary to avoid derailing critical ongoing negotiations with our foreign trading partners and threatening broader U.S. strategic interests internationally,\" he wrote.",
      "The high court has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three Trump appointees. Although it has frequently ruled in favor of Trump in the first few months of his term, some legal experts believe it may be more skeptical about his tariff powers.",
      "During the Biden administration, the court was skeptical of the White House\u2019s moves to seek broad powers via laws enacted by Congress that did not explicitly authorize them. In one significant example, the court, endorsing what has been dubbed the \"major questions doctrine,\" ruled against President Joe Biden's plan to forgive student loan debt.",
      "The case under appeal affects two sets of tariffs Trump has imposed. The first are the country-by-country or \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which now range from 34% for China to a 10% baseline for the rest of the world. The second is a 25% tariff Trump imposed on some goods from Canada, China and Mexico for what the administration said was their failure to curb the flow of fentanyl.",
      "Other tariffs implemented under other laws, such as 50% steel and aluminum tariffs on all other worldwide trading partners, were implemented under other statutes not at issue in the case.",
      "Even if Trump loses at the Supreme Court, he has other avenues to impose additional tariffs.",
      "V.O.S. Selections Inc., a wine and spirits importer, and Plastic Services and Products, a pipe and fittings company, are among five businesses that sued Trump over his use of the emergency law. Twelve states also challenged the move.",
      "The Court of International Trade initially blocked the tariffs in late May, prompting the Trump administration to appeal.",
      "Trump has long sought to raise revenue by taxing imported goods, which he believes will revitalize manufacturing in the United States. While the tariffs are bringing in billions of dollars in revenue, economists say they are slowing U.S. economic growth, while inflation has also ticked up."

      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s flight landed safely in Bulgaria, just a short distance from Russian territory. But it has given a jolt to European fears over Moscow\u2019s suspected interference with Western signals.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s military is getting stronger, and it wants the world to know it.",
      "The world\u2019s largest active military, with more than 2 million personnel, is holding one of its biggest parades ever on Wednesday, a highly choreographed \u201cVictory Day\u201d spectacle to mark the 80th anniversary of Imperial Japan\u2019s surrender at the end of World War II.",
      "The grand occasion in Beijing will showcase not just China\u2019s growing ability to rival the United States in any future conflict, but support from some of the world\u2019s most heavily sanctioned nations in a display of unity against the West.",
      "Thousands of troops will march through Tiananmen Square, where they will be reviewed by Chinese President Xi Jinping as heads of government and state from 26 other countries look on.",
      "Topping the guest list are Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has pressed on with his war against Ukraine despite a U.S. peace push, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a rare departure from his isolated, nuclear-armed state.",
      "Leaders from the United States and other Western governments have declined to attend the parade, partly because of the presence of Putin.",
      "It comes amid heightened military tensions in the region as China clashes with neighbors in the South China Sea and the U.S. and its allies brace for potential conflict over Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a show of force,\u201d said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s a means to show China\u2019s neighbors, other countries around the world, that China\u2019s military is formidable.\u201d",
      "The parade will showcase China\u2019s growing military power under Xi, who has overseen a modernization campaign as well as political purges of senior officials and even defense ministers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now become a much more capable force that is increasingly a near peer, if not a true peer, to the U.S. military in many respects,\u201d said Elsa B. Kania, a doctoral candidate at Harvard and an adjunct senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington that specializes in U.S. national security issues.",
      "China, whose annual defense spending is estimated to be about a third of the $1.3 trillion spent by the United States, has said its goal is for military modernization to be \u201cbasically complete\u201d by 2035, and for the Chinese military to be \u201cworld class\u201d by 2049, the 100th anniversary of communist rule.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is the only world-class military in the world, and we still have a need to catch up with the United States \u2014 and it will take time,\u201d Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing, told NBC News in an interview.",
      "\u201cBut I believe by 2049, which is still far away, we should be confident to reach the objective,\u201d said Zhou, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army.",
      "Confidence on display",
      "Security has been tight in Beijing in the weeks leading up to the parade, disrupting businesses and traffic. Tanks could be heard rolling down the streets during weekly overnight rehearsals that paralyzed the city center and were conducted with great secrecy.",
      "This is China\u2019s first military parade since 2019, when Beijing commemorated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and its third under Xi, who also held one in 2015 for the 70th anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender.",
      "The legacy of World War II is still a sensitive subject between Japan and China, which is estimated to have suffered between 20 million and 35 million military and civilian deaths during a 14-year Japanese invasion and occupation that China calls the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.",
      "The parade is aimed just as much at the Chinese public as it is at foreign adversaries, said Thompson, the former director for China, Taiwan and Mongolia at the U.S. Department of Defense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fanning anti-Japanese sentiments to increase the party\u2019s legitimacy in the eyes of its own people,\u201d he said, particularly at a time when the Chinese public is concerned about a slowing economy.",
      "Japan, a key U.S. ally, has reportedly urged other countries not to attend, leading China to lodge a diplomatic complaint.",
      "According to the Chinese government, much of the equipment included in the 70-minute parade is being revealed for the first time.",
      "In addition to the troops, the parade will involve more than 100 aircraft and hundreds of ground armaments, all of them domestically made and battle-ready, officials said at an Aug. 20 news conference in Beijing.",
      "The \u201cnew-generation\u201d equipment on display \u201creflects a high degree of informatization and intelligence, underscoring our military\u2019s ability to adapt to technological advances and evolving warfare patterns, and to win future conflicts,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Wu Zeke, deputy director of the parade.",
      "Air and missile defense systems that could make an appearance include the HQ-19 and the more advanced HQ-26 and HQ-29, all of which are designed to intercept ballistic missiles and are believed to have capabilities similar to equivalent U.S. systems.",
      "Military observers are also watching for any new intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as new supersonic and hypersonic missiles.",
      "Such missiles \u201cpose a big threat for U.S. naval ships\u201d that would be central to any U.S. military intervention in the Asia-Pacific, said Shinji Yamaguchi, a senior research fellow in the China Studies Division at the Japanese government\u2019s National Institute for Defense Studies.",
      "China is also expected to display autonomous drones, which especially since the war in Ukraine have \u201creally changed the way of warfare,\u201d Yamaguchi said, as well as unmanned underwater vehicles, also known as sea drones.",
      "In a conflict, China could deploy sea drones in the Taiwan Strait and elsewhere \u201cto strengthen intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,\u201d Yamaguchi said.",
      "Jet fighters will also be in focus after Pakistan said it used Chinese-built J-10Cs to shoot down Indian aircraft during a four-day conflict in May.",
      "But while China has become more open about displaying weaponry as its confidence grows, it is difficult to know what is going on behind the scenes.",
      "The \u201cdramatic\u201d removal of officials \u201chas raised questions about Xi Jinping\u2019s trust in military leaders, or about whether systemic problems of corruption can be resolved,\u201d Kania said.",
      "There has also been little recent real-world demonstration of the actual capabilities of the Chinese military, whose last experience in a large-scale conflict was against Vietnam in 1979.",
      "\u201cNone of this has been tested. Nobody knows,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAnd this may be one of the reasons that China relies on this very conventional form of deterrence and signaling in the form of a parade.\u201d",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Janis Mackey Frayer from Beijing."

      "TIANJIN, China \u2014 A private car ride with Vladimir Putin may not be as special as President Donald Trump thought.",
      "With a backseat bromance of their own, as well as hand-holding and hugs, the Russian leader, his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, and their host, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, put on a display Monday that seemed designed to turn heads in Washington.",
      "The three leaders staked out long-held positions in comments at this key regional summit in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, but the tenor and the timing of the trio's embrace was impossible to ignore.",
      "India, long courted by the West as a crucial Asian partner and counterweight to China, has been rattled by Trump\u2019s tariffs; the Kremlin has publicly brushed aside Washington's peace push in Ukraine; and Beijing continues to spar with the U.S. over trade, Taiwan and global influence.",
      "Amid this thicket of tensions, the cozy optics at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) gathering appeared a clear signal in the face of U.S. pressure.",
      "Weeks after Trump and Putin made headlines with a protocol-busting ride in \u201cThe Beast\u201d at their Alaska summit, Modi joined the Russian leader for a drive in the back of Putin's own armored limo \u2014 a not-so-subtle statement of defiance just days after the U.S. doubled tariffs on India to 50% as punishment for buying Russian oil.",
      "Russian state media reporter Pavel Zarubin said the pair spent nearly an hour in the car before proceeding to bilateral talks.",
      "\u201cI always feel that meeting you has been a memorable experience,\u201d Modi said to Putin later during the talks.",
      "The Russian leader called Modi his \"dear friend,\" espousing Russia and India's \"friendly and trusting\" relations.",
      "In a speech to delegates, Putin did say that \u201cunderstandings\u201d reached at his summit with Trump could form the basis for peace in Ukraine, but he gave little indication of a shift in his position and issued his customary rebuke blaming the West\u2019s \u201cconstant attempts to drag Ukraine into NATO\u201d for causing the war.",
      "'A totally one sided disaster!'",
      "Perhaps watching from Washington, Trump said Monday that the relationship between India and the U.S. had been \u201ca totally one sided disaster!\u201d and chided New Delhi for buying \u201cmost of its oil and military products from Russia,\u201d and \u201cvery little from the U.S.\u201d",
      "He said that India had now offered to cut their tariffs on U.S. goods to zero. \"But it's getting late,\" Trump added.",
      "Whether the theatrics in Tianjin were spontaneous or carefully planned, \u201cthe message remains the same,\u201d Keir Giles, a senior fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe close relationship that Trump sought with Putin is now on display between Putin and others,\u201d he said, adding that the U.S. had \"given India a real cause to look for friendship and partnership elsewhere.\"",
      "That friction had also given India a reason to \u201cmend fences\u201d with China, said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "India has \"lots of problems,\" with China, she said, \"but it is right on their border, and it\u2019s their largest trading partner in goods.\"",
      "Xi, for his part, criticized the \u201cbullying behavior\u201d from unnamed countries, a veiled reference to the U.S.",
      "He outlined his longstanding ambition to challenge the U.S.-led global economic and security order. \u201cWe must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics, and practice true multilateralism,\u201d he said, while laying out a new \u201cGlobal Governance Initiative\u201d that was short on concrete policies.",
      "Talking in Tianjin",
      "Much of this northeastern port city was on lockdown ahead of the summit, the biggest since the SCO\u2019s founding in 2001.",
      "China welcomed dozens of leaders from Eurasian member states and other partner and observer countries for talks on trade, energy cooperation and regional stability. Their motorcades brought car and pedestrian traffic to a halt, with the area around the sprawling event venue on lockdown and security stepped up at the city\u2019s train station.",
      "Security barriers and police-manned checkpoints were present throughout Tianjin, with authorities' usual caution exacerbated by a spectacular military parade set to take place Wednesday in nearby Beijing.",
      "Focus on the growing summit, part of China\u2019s long-running effort to challenge U.S. dominance, has only been amplified this year by global upheaval from Trump-era policies and other foreign policy shifts.",
      "India and China have long sparred over their Himalayan border, trade tensions and Beijing\u2019s support for India\u2019s rival, Pakistan.",
      "But shared grievances \u2014 including Trump\u2019s tariffs, which in China\u2019s case have reached as high as 145% \u2014 have helped carve out common ground.",
      "Against that backdrop, Modi\u2019s first visit to China in seven years and his apparent camaraderie with Xi and Putin appeared especially striking.",
      "While Modi joyously clasped Trump\u2019s hand during a massive rally in Texas in 2019, Indian media on Monday seized on his friendship with Putin as a message of defiance against the U.S.",
      "Indian television channel Republic World called it a \u201cbig diplomatic win\u201d for India, while a headline on news channel Aaj Tak ran \u201cTrump\u2019s dictator vs. Modi-Putin\u2019s friendship.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the Tianjin summit, the U.S. embassy in India highlighted that the partnership between the two nations \u201ccontinues to reach new heights,\u201d spanning \u201cinnovation and entrepreneurship, defense, and broader bilateral ties.\u201d",
      "But the message, from Modi as well as Xi and Putin, seemed clear: They may have differences, but they are ready to stand \u2014 or sit \u2014 together.",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Tianjin, and Freddie Clayton from London.",
      "CORRECTION (Sept. 2, 2025, 2 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the year the Shanghai Cooperation Organization was founded. It was 2001, not 2002."

      "PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 At least 800 people have been killed and more than 1,300 others injured in Afghanistan after a 6.0-magnitude earthquake hit the country, Taliban officials said Monday.",
      "The earthquake struck 17 miles from the eastern city of Jalalabad, near the border with Pakistan, at around midnight local time (3:30 p.m. ET Sunday), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Because the earthquake hit a remote mountainous area, \u201cit will take time to get the exact information about human losses and damage to the infrastructure,\u201d said Sharafat Zaman, a spokesperson for the Afghan Public Health Ministry.",
      "\u201cWe have launched a massive rescue operation and mobilized hundreds of people to help people in the affected areas,\u201d Zaman said.",
      "He called for international aid to tackle the devastation, which left rescue teams battling to reach remote areas and loved ones searching desperately through the rubble of homes.",
      "Construction quality is poor in rural Afghanistan, where buildings are often made of mud bricks and wood. Videos showed collapsed homes and rescuers combing for survivors. Injured people from these remote areas were seen being lifted on gurneys onto helicopters.",
      "Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said the death toll had risen to 800 people. Earlier, Interior Ministry spokesperson Mufti Abdul Matin Qani had said 622 people had been confirmed dead and more than 1,300 injured in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar, which includes Jalalabad and Kunar.",
      "The ministry said that 1,000 injured people had been evacuated and admitted to hospitals.",
      "A United Nations team was mobilized, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a post on X. Several U.N. organizations, including the Children's Fund, the World Health Organization, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the International Organization for Migration, said on X that they were providing emergency assistance.",
      "'I was half-buried'",
      "Victims watched as their homes collapsed before their eyes at night. One survivor, Sadiqullah, said, \"I was half-buried and unable to get out.\"",
      "Sadiqullah, who like other Afghans uses only one name, was awakened by what he described as a loud boom sound and rushed to grab his family, who were sleeping.",
      "He was able to rescue three of his children but before he could rescue the rest of his family, the roof fell on top of him.",
      "\"My wife and two sons are dead and my father is injured and in hospital with me,\" he told The Associated Press. \"We were trapped for three to four hours until people from other areas arrived and pulled me out.\u201d",
      "Since the initial quake, at least five aftershocks ranging from 4.5 to 5.2 magnitude have hit the area throughout Monday, according to the U.S. Geological Service.",
      "Aftershocks can continue for days and can sometimes be worse than the first quake.",
      "Afghanistan is especially vulnerable to earthquakes as it sits on top of several fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian plates meet. The mountainous terrain of eastern Afghanistan is also prone to landslides, making it harder for emergency services to carry out rescues.",
      "This quake was especially devastating as it hit at a shallow depth of 5 miles, making it far more destructive even at moderate magnitude.",
      "In 2022, around 1,000 people were killed and thousands more were injured when a 5.9-magnitude earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan.",
      "That, too, was a shallow quake.",
      "The following year, three 6.3-magnitude quakes hit the western Afghanistan province of Herat. The Taliban said around 4,000 people were killed, though the United Nations put the death tally at 1,500.",
      "Monday's quake comes at a challenging time for Afghanistan, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, which is suffering from four consecutive years of drought and the influx of over 2.3 million Afghans who have returned from Iran and Pakistan this year.",
      "\u201cBelow-average first and second season crop production and reduced livestock income limit their ability to stock food for the winter,\u201d the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, which was established by the United States Agency for International Development, said in a report last week.",

      "Until last year, the U.S. provided nearly half of all humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. But under President Donald Trump, the U.S. has cancelled an estimated $1.7 billion of that support, according to a report filed to Congress in April by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.",
      "The administration has also refused to restore its emergency food aid for Afghanistan, while restoring it for some other countries.",

      "On Sunday, Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Tianjin, where China is hosting a summit of the 10-member Shanghai Cooperation Organization.",
      "Xi told Modi that the world\u2019s two most populous countries should be \u201cpartners rather than rivals\u201d and that the \u201cdragon\u201d and the \u201celephant\u201d should come together.",

      "\u201cXi wants Modi and India to show that they are working with him and with China to the extent that they are not following the Trump or U.S. lead in containing China,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the SOAS University of London.",
      "Last month, the Chinese ambassador to New Delhi delivered a rare public defense of India against the tariff increase, calling the U.S. a \u201cbully.\u201d",
      "It was a major step up from the deep freeze that began in 2020 with a border clash in India\u2019s Himalayan region of Ladakh that killed at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers and plunged relations to the point that the two countries suspended direct flights.",
      "Only seven months ago, India was entering Trump\u2019s second presidential term in a relatively strong position, with Modi among the first world leaders to visit his \u201cdear friend\u201d at the White House.",
      "But tensions soon arose, with Trump complaining that Apple was producing iPhones in India instead of the U.S. India also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that he brokered a ceasefire in its four-day conflict with neighboring Pakistan.",
      "New Delhi was further incensed weeks later when Trump hosted Pakistan\u2019s powerful army chief at the White House in an unprecedented meeting.",
      "\u201cThe Indians saw this as a slap in the face for them,\u201d Mahbubani said. \u201cSo there is now, even as we are speaking, a tremendous amount of re-evaluation going on in Delhi about where India\u2019s place in the world is.\u201d",
      "At the same time, China and India have been moving cautiously to restore their relationship, reaching a deal to resolve their 2020 border standoff and announcing the resumption of direct flights.",
      "But not everybody is convinced about China extending a friendly hand, and the two countries still have major differences.",
      "One of the biggest is China\u2019s ties with Pakistan, India\u2019s archrival and a fellow nuclear power. During their conflict in May, Pakistan said it had used Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets to shoot down Indian military aircraft.",
      "\u201cThere was a huge step up in the kind of assistance that the Chinese were providing Pakistan, not merely in terms of selling them equipment and platforms, but on intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance,\u201d Gautam Bambawale, a former Indian ambassador to Beijing, said in an interview. \u201cSo we will go by actions on those things.\u201d",
      "Bambawale said it could take \u201cmonths, if not years\u201d for the relationship to return to where it was before 2020, let alone reach new heights.",
      "Though India and China are strong trading partners, that has not been enough to smooth over other diplomatic issues.",
      "Earlier this month, after a meeting in New Delhi between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, Beijing released a readout suggesting Jaishankar had acknowledged that Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy, \u201cis a part of China.\u201d",
      "When asked if Jaishankar made that statement, an Indian government official who was familiar with the discussions between the diplomats but not authorized to speak to the media, told NBC News that there was no change in India\u2019s position on Taiwan.",
      "\u201cWe stressed that like the rest of the world, India has a relationship with Taiwan that focuses on economic, technology and cultural ties,\u201d the official said.",
      "The clarification, which was also reported by Indian news organizations, prompted Beijing to double down, saying it was a \u201csurprise\u201d and \u201cinconsistent with the facts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would seem that some people in India have tried to undermine China\u2019s sovereignty on the Taiwan question and impede the improvement of China-India relations,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.",
      "The two countries also have other border disputes, as well as a manufacturing rivalry that may only worsen as companies try to shift production from China. China, which is worried about technology transfer, has imposed curbs on the export of rare earth materials to India and recalled some of its nationals working in specialized roles.",
      "\u201cThe meeting between Modi and Xi will not remove the structural issues between India and China,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cBut the big issue for Xi outside of China now is U.S. pressure, and making sure India does not appear to be on the U.S. side is therefore significant.\u201d",
      "\u201cOn this occasion, optics does matter,\u201d he added."

    "story": [
      "An Israeli airstrike killed the prime minister of Yemen\u2019s rebel-controlled government, the Iran-backed Houthi militant group said Saturday.",
      "Ahmed al-Rawahi was killed Thursday alongside other ministers in a strike on the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, the rebels said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe declare the martyrdom of the fighter Ahmed Ghalib Al-Rahawi, Prime Minister in the Government of Change and Construction, along with a number of his fellow ministers,\u201d it said.",
      "Al-Rahawi, who had served as prime minister of the Houthi-led government since 2024, was killed during a government workshop evaluating \u201cits activities and performance during a year of its work,\u201d the statement added.",
      "Following his death, Houthi President Mahdi Al-Mashat appointed Mohammed Ahmed Ahmed Muftah, the first deputy prime minister, to serve as acting prime minister.",
      "The Israeli military said Thursday it \u201cprecisely struck a Houthi terrorist regime military target in the area of Sanaa in Yemen.\u201d On Saturday, the IDF confirmed that Al-Rahawi \"was eliminated in the strike, along with additional senior officials of the Houthi terrorist regime.\"",
      "The Houthis have repeatedly fired missiles at Israel during its war with Hamas, framing their attacks on Israel and Red Sea shipping as part of an allied defense of Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "In response to Houthi attacks, Israel has bombarded rebel-held areas in Yemen.",
      "\u201cYemen endures a lot for the victory of the Palestinian people,\u201d al-Rahawi said following an Israeli strike last week that struck an oil facility owned by the country\u2019s main oil company, which is controlled by the rebels in Sanaa as well as a power plant.",
      "The Aug. 24 strike came three days after the Houthis launched a ballistic missile toward Israel that its military described as the first cluster bomb the rebels had launched at it since 2023.",
      "The prime minister hailed from the southern province of Abyan, and was an ally to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. He allied himself with the Houthis when the rebels overran Sanaa, and much of the north and center of the country in 2014, initiating the country\u2019s long-running civil war. He was appointed as prime minister in August 2024.",
      "Al-Rahawi is the most senior Houthi official to be killed since the United States and Israel began their air and naval campaign in response to the rebels\u2019 missile and drone attacks on Israel and on ships in the Red Sea. The U.S. and Israeli strikes killed dozens of people. One U.S. strike in April hit a prison holding African migrants in the northern Sadaa province, killing at least 68 people and wounding 47 others."
