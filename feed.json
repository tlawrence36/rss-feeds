      "While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his high-stakes federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel",
      "LOS ANGELES -- While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel.",
      "Combs, 55, who is one of the most influential figures in hip-hop history, now faces charges, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking involving two former partners and transporting people across state lines for prostitution. Prosecutors have painted a dark portrait of the mogul, whose alleged pattern of violence included drug-fueled sex parties he reportedly called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "If convicted, the three-time Grammy winner could face life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how Combs\u2019 business portfolio and public image have crumbled under the weight of the allegations.",
      "Before Combs was arrested and charged, his major business ventures had collapsed: He stepped down and later fully divested from Revolt TV, which was founded in 2013. The network offered a mix of programming focused on hip-hop culture, R&B music, social justice and documentaries.",
      "He also reportedly lost a Hulu reality series deal and saw his once-iconic fashion brand Sean John vanish from Macy\u2019s shelves.",
      "After surveillance footage surfaced last year showing Combs physically assaulting singer Cassie, his then-girlfriend, in 2016, consequences mounted: New York City revoked his ceremonial key, Peloton pulled his music, Howard University rescinded his honorary degree and his charter school in Harlem cut ties.",
      "Last year, Combs settled a legal dispute with Diageo, relinquishing control of his lucrative spirits brands, Ciroc and DeLe\u00f3n. While many of his ventures have unraveled, his music catalog \u2014 for now \u2014 remains intact.",
      "Bad Boy Records may be synonymous with 1990s icons like The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, Ma$e, and 112, but Combs kept the label relevant before his arrest with high-profile releases.",
      "In 2023, Combs dropped \u201c The Love Album: Off the Grid,\u201d which was his first solo studio album in nearly two decades, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e released her critically acclaimed project \u201d The Age of Pleasure \" through Bad Boy. Both albums earned Grammy nominations, with Mon\u00e1e\u2019s effort recognized in the prestigious record of the year category.",
      "Ahead of the \u201cThe Love Album\u201d release, Combs made headlines by returning Bad Boy publishing rights to several former artists and songwriters, years after he was criticized for how he handled their contracts.",
      "Bad Boy Records remains operational, but the label has been significantly shaken by Combs' legal firestorm and it hasn't announced any major upcoming releases.",
      "Last week, a surprise EP called \u201cNever Stop\u201d released by his son, King Combs, and Ye (formerly Kanye West), showed support for the embattled mogul. The project was released through Goodfellas Entertainment.",
      "Bad Boy Records remained active through 2022, backing Machine Gun Kelly\u2019s \u201cMainstream Sellout\u201d under the Bad Boy umbrella. He was a producer on MTV\u2019s reality television series \u201cMaking the Band,\u201d and \u201cMaking His Band,\u201d launching the careers of artists like the girl group Danity Kane and male R&B group Day 26.",
      "Combs has been sued by multiple people who claim to have been victims of physical or sexual abuse. He has already paid $20 million to settle with one accuser, his former girlfriend Cassie. Most of those lawsuits, though, are still pending. It isn\u2019t clear how many, if any, will be successful, or how much it will cost Combs to defend himself in court. Combs and his lawyers have denied all the misconduct allegations and dismissed his accusers as out for a big payday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have also informed the court that if Combs is convicted, they would seek to have him forfeit any assets, including property, \u201cused to commit or facilitate\u201d his crimes. They won\u2019t detail exactly what property that might involve until after the trial is over.",
      "Despite the legal turmoil surrounding Combs, his music catalog remains widely available on major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. None of the streamers have publicly addressed whether they plan to adjust how his music is featured if Combs is convicted.",
      "Interestingly, Combs\u2019 music saw a roughly 20% boost in U.S. streaming between April and May 2025, his biggest monthly spike this year, according to Luminate. The numbers jump coincided with key moments in the trial, including testimonies from Cassie and Kid Cudi.",
      "However, there was a slight drop-off with a 5 to 10% decrease in June compared to the previous month\u2019s streams.",
      "Streaming makes up a fraction of an artist's revenue and is calculated through a complicated process called \u201cstreamshare.\" Most artists see very little pay from digital services.",
      "Sean John, founded in 1998, has gone largely dormant, with its presence disappearing from major retailers like Macy's. There are no clear signs of a relaunch on the horizon.",
      "In 2023, Combs launched Empower Global, an online marketplace designed to uplift Black-owned businesses and strengthen the Black dollar. He positioned the platform as a modern-day \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d backing it with a reported $20 million of his own investment.",
      "The platform debuted with 70 brands and planned to expand by onboarding new Black-owned businesses each month, aiming to feature more than 200 by year\u2019s end.",
      "However, as 2023 came to a close, several brands cut ties with Empower Global. It was reported that some cited disappointing performance and growing concerns over the misconduct allegations surrounding Combs.",

      "LONDON -- The Glastonbury Festival is making headlines for controversy rather than music.",
      "The likes of Olivia Rodrigo, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Charli XCX, Busta Rhymes and Doechii played to tens of thousands onsite, and millions more on TV, during Britain\u2019s biggest and most famous music extravaganza. But it\u2019s little-known rap-punk duo Bob Vylan attracting politicians\u2019 ire \u2014 and a police probe \u2014 after leading a chant calling for \u201cdeath\u201d to the Israeli military.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time politics has collided with pop at the festival. For half a century, Britain\u2019s big political and cultural divides have found their way onstage at Glastonbury.",
      "The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts, to give it its full name, was founded by Michael Eavis in 1970 on his Worthy Farm, 120 miles (some 200 kilometers) southwest of London. It\u2019s still run by the 90-year-old farmer and his daughter, Emily Eavis.",
      "Originally a hippie happening with a 1 pound ticket price (about 20 pounds or $27 today), Glastonbury has largely shed its counterculture cachet. These days, tickets for the three-day event cost close to 400 pounds. But it remains famous for its eclectic lineup, unique atmosphere and commitment to environmentalism and other progressive causes.",
      "This year\u2019s event drew about 200,000 people to see almost 4,000 performers on 120 stages, alongside film screenings and live debates on a variety of issues.",
      "Glastonbury was founded in a spirit of hippie idealism that has never entirely faded. In the 1980s, the festival donated some of its profits to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which protested U.S. nuclear weapons on British soil. It continues to support charities including Oxfam and Greenpeace.",
      "By the late 1980s, attendees included New Age \u201ctravelers\u201d involved with the U.K.\u2019s unofficial and anarchic rave scene. In 1990, some travelers clashed with security at the site, leading to significant damage and more than 200 arrests.",
      "Since then, the festival\u2019s security and organization have grown increasingly professional, sparking regret from some fans who feel it has lost its alternative spirit.",
      "The 2016 festival coincided with the U.K.\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, and the decision to leave the bloc \u2014 which most young people opposed \u2014 overshadowed the event. Many performers mentioned Brexit and the dispirited mood, including headliner Adele, who urged people to \u201clook after each other.\u201d",
      "Performers have often vented their opposition to politicians from the stage. In 2019, rapper Stormzy led the crowd in \u201cF___ Boris\u201d chants aimed at then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This year, Irish rappers Kneecap directed the same expletive at Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "In contrast, then-Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was warmly received at the festival in 2017 after doing better than expected against the Conservatives in a general election.",
      "Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has provoked heightened emotions that spilled over onto Glastonbury\u2019s stages.",
      "Before the event, some politicians called for Glastonbury to cancel a performance by Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap, whose pro-Palestinian comments, critics say, have crossed a line into support for violence.",
      "Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh has been charged under the Terrorism Act with supporting a proscribed organization for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert in London in November. He denies the charge, and Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause.",
      "Kneecap\u2019s energetic set included plenty of pro-Palestinian comments and criticism of the government. But it was the act that preceded them, Bob Vylan, that caused a furor when a member of the duo led chants of \u201cdeath to the IDF,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "The Avon and Somerset Police force said officers would review video evidence \u201cto determine whether any offenses may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.",
      "Michael and Emily Eavis said Bob Vylan had \u201cvery much crossed a line.\u201d They said \u201cthere is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s publicly funded national broadcaster is under fire for showing Bob Vylan\u2019s set, one of dozens of Glastonbury performances it streamed live online.",
      "The BBC said Monday that it should have cut off the broadcast after the \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d comments, and has removed the performance from its website. But the government is demanding to know what \u201cdue diligence\u201d it did on Bob Vylan before the broadcast.",
      "Some media experts say the broadcaster is in a difficult position. Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said Britain\u2019s influential right-wing press,\u201d including newspapers such as the Daily Mail and The Sun, frequently attack the BBC, \u201cfor both commercial and ideological reasons.\u201d",
      "Right-leaning newspapers featured the Bob Vylan story prominently, and Barnett said that attention \u201cputs any political leader under enormous pressure\u201d to express an opinion.",

The sky itself is no limit for this couple who have traveled into space, and expectations are about as high.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most enchanting cities as backdrop? Check.",
      "Star-studded guestlist and tabloid buzz? Of course.",
      "Local flavor? You bet.",
      "Beyond that, the team of the world\u2019s fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.",
      "On Thursday, dozens of private jets touched down at Venice\u2019s airport as yachts pulled into the city\u2019s famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple\u2019s love as to their extraordinary wealth.",
      "The heady hoopla recalled the 2014 wedding in Venice of actor George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, when adoring crowds lined the canals and hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside City Hall.",
      "Not so for these nuptials, which have become a lightning rod for protests.",
      "Still, any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.",
      "Whatever happens, it will be a wedding for the ages.",
      "Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of luxury travel advisory and event planner Embark Beyond.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,\u201d said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. \"There\u2019s very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.\u201d",
      "It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.",
      "Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/S\u00e1nchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).",
      "It\u2019s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola\u2019s annual report.",
      "Bezos\u2019 team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag.",
      "\u201cHow do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?\u201d Ezon said. \u201dYou could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that\u2019s only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,\" or expand the celebration to local landmarks.",
      "There's no sign S\u00e1nchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice\u2019s tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false.",
      "On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and guests to the Madonna dell\u2019Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom \u2014 as police on jet skis patrolled.",
      "Local media have reported the couple will hold a ceremony Friday on San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark\u2019s Square. Associated Press journalists circling the island Thursday saw workers assembling tents and private security personnel stationed at every pier, including a newly built one.",
      "Media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.",
      "There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city.",
      "They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents\u2019 needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 are protesting under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down a Venice canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.",
      "Authorities \u2014 from Venice's mayor to the nation\u2019s tourism minister \u2014 have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.",

      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin\u2019s sons William and Ryan confirmed his death to trade outlets. The Associated Press\u2019 messages to Schifrin\u2019s publicist and representatives for either brother were not immediately returned.",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \u201cCool Hand Luke,\u201d \u201cThe Fox,\u201d \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and \u201cThe Sting II.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe movie dictates what the music will be.\u201d",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan. But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \u201conly the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\u201d by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\u201cThe producer called me and told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it\u2019s going to start with a fuse,\u2019\u201d Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \u201cSo I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that\u2019s why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\u201d",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin\u2019s music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin\u2019s music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\u201cI remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\u201d Giacchino told NPR. \u201cAnd I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, \u2018Just have fun with it.\u2019 And I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996\u2019s first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand\u2019s Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band. Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie\u2019s quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \u201cGillespiana.\u201d",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965\u2019s \u201cJazz Suite on the Mass Texts\u201d while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \u201cTango,\u201d \u201cRush Hour\u201d and its two sequels, \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d \u201cThe Bridge of San Luis Rey,\u201d \u201cAfter the Sunset\u201d and the horror film \u201cAbominable.\u201d",
      "Writing the arrangements for \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d Schifrin decided that the main character wasn\u2019t in fact Clint Eastwood\u2019s hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\u201cYou would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI wrote a theme for Scorpio.\u201d",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\u201cReceiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\u201d Schifrin said at the time. \u201cIt is mission accomplished.\u201d",
      "Among Schifrin\u2019s conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California\u2019s Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \u201cChristmas in Vienna\u201d in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \u201cLetters from Argentina,\u201d nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event\u2019s 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \u201cSongs of the Aztecs.\u201d The work premiered at Mexico\u2019s Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site\u2019s Aztec temple.",
      "\u201cI found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cBut the real answer is that there\u2019s something magic about it. ... There\u2019s something magic in the art of music anyway.\u201d",
      "In addition to his sons, he\u2019s survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "Bruce Springsteen isn't the only musician to complete or launch anticipated album projects, then to see it never see the light of day",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea that Bruce Springsteen wrote, recorded and ultimately shelved entire albums of music may seem odd to the casual listener. Why put yourself through all that work for nothing?",
      "Yet \u201clost albums\u201d are embedded in music industry lore. Some were literally lost. Some remained unfinished or unreleased because of tragedy, shortsighted executives or creators who were perfectionist \u2014 or had short attention spans.",
      "Often, the music is eventually made public, like Springsteen is doing now, although out of context from the times in which it was originally made.",
      "So in honor of Springsteen's 83-song \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums\u201d box set being released Friday, The Associated Press has collected 10 examples of albums that were meant to be but weren't.",
      "Back in the news with the death of Brian Wilson, this album \u201cinvented the category of the lost masterpiece in popular music,\u201d says Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. Some of the material that surfaced suggested Wilson, the Beach Boys' chief writer, was well on his way: the majestic single \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d the centerpiece \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and the reflective \u201cSurf's Up.\u201d Wilson succumbed to internal competitive pressure worsened by mental illness and drug abuse while making it in 1966 and 1967, eventually aborting the project. He later finished it as a solo album backed by the Wondermints in 2004. The better-known songs were joined with some psychedelic-era curios that displayed Wilson's melodic sense and matchless ability as a vocal arranger, along with lyrics that some fellow Beach Boys worried were too \u201cout there.\u201d",
      "The mercurial Prince pulled back this disc, set for release in December 1987, at the last minute. Some promo copies had already slipped out, and it was so widely bootlegged that when Warner Bros. officially put it out in limited release in 1994, the company billed it as \u201cThe Legendary Black Album.\u201d Encased in an all-black sleeve, the project was said to be Prince's nod to Black fans who may have felt they had lost him to a pop audience. It's almost nonstop funk, including a lascivious Cindy Crawford tribute and the workout \u201cSuperfunkycalifragisexy.\u201d The maestro's instincts were well-placed, though. Coming after \u201cSign O' the Times\u201d \u2014 arguably his peak \u2014 this would have felt like a minor project.",
      "Written and recorded in 2003, Green Day's \u201cCigarettes and Valentines\u201d was actually lost; someone apparently stole the master tapes. Feeling on a creative roll, the rock trio decided against recreating what they'd done and pressed on with new material. Smart move. The result was \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d the band's best work. Perhaps the robbery was \u201cjust a sign that we made a crappy record and we should make a better one,\u201d songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong told MTV. The title cut later surfaced on a 2010 live album. The rest was lost to time.",
      "To say anticipation was high for Dr. Dre\u2019s third album when he started recording in 2002 puts it mildly. The theme disc about a hitman, which Dre described as a \u201chip-hop musical,\u201d had an all-star squad of contributors including Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes and Kendrick Lamar. \u201cI\u2019d describe it as the most advanced rap album musically and lyrically we\u2019ll probably ever have a chance to listen to,\u201d co-producer Scott Storch told MTV. But we never have. When he announced a different third album in 2015, Dre explained on his radio show what happened to \u201cDetox\u201d: \u201cI didn\u2019t like it. It wasn\u2019t good. ... I worked my ass off on it, and I don\u2019t think I did a good enough job.\u201d",
      "A series of unfinished demos, \u201cBlack Gold\u201d was a taste of where guitar god Jimi Hendrix might have gone creatively if he hadn't died at 27 in 1970. He was composing a song suite about an animated Black superhero, says Tom Maxwell, whose podcast \u201cShelved\u201d unearths stories behind lost music. Hendrix sent a tape of his work to longtime drummer Mitch Mitchell for advice on fleshing it out. That music was set aside at Mitchell's home and forgotten for two decades after Hendrix died. To date, Hendrix's estate has made only one of these recordings public, a song called \u201cSuddenly November Morning.\u201d Hendrix, after clearing his throat, slips in and out of falsetto while accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar.",
      "Written while Yoko Ono was separated from John Lennon during his infamous \u201clost weekend\u201d in 1973-74, \u201cA Story\u201d had the potential of changing the musical narrative around her. It was a strong album \u2014 without the avant-garde stylings that made Ono a challenge for mainstream listeners \u2014 recorded with musicians who worked on Lennon's \u201cWalls & Bridges.\u201d Maxwell calls it \u201can emancipation manifesto\u201d that was set aside when Ono reconciled with Lennon. She's never publicly explained why, Maxwell says, although one song seems clearly about an affair she had while Lennon was away. Some of the material from \u201cA Story\u201d was included as part of the \u201cOnobox\u201d project that came out in 1992, and the album was released separately in 1997. Ono also re-recorded some of its songs in 1980, and Lennon was holding a tape of her composition \u201cIt Happened\u201d when he was shot and killed. In it, she sings about an unspecified, seemingly traumatic event: \u201cIt happened at a time of my life when I least expected.\u201d That wasn't even the most chilling premonition. Her song \u201cO'Oh\u201d ended with firecrackers that sound like gunshots. It was left off the 1997 release.",
      "Guns N' Roses was at the top of the hard rock world when they began recording a new album in 1994. It didn't go well. Inconclusive sessions slogged on for years, and all but singer Axl Rose left the group. Recording costs exceeded a staggering $13 million, by some accounts the most expensive rock album ever. One witness told The New York Times in 2005: \u201cWhat Axl wanted to do was to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on indefinitely, which is what they've done.\u201d When \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d was finally released in 2008, the world yawned.",
      "Not even a decade after the triumph of \u201cWhat's Going On,\u201d Marvin Gaye was floundering. His \u201cHere, My Dear\u201d divorce album flopped, he struggled with drugs and searched for relevance in the disco era. The single \u201cEgo Tripping Out,\u201d meant to herald a new album, laid bare the problems: Over a melody cribbed from Donna Summer's \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d the famously cool \u201cLove Man\u201d boasted like an insecure rapper. He scrapped the album, repurposing some its material for the 1981 disc \u201cIn Our Lifetime,\u201d a process so fraught he bitterly left his longtime label Motown. Gaye went to CBS, made a huge comeback with \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d then was shot dead by his father in 1984.",
      "Neil Young rivals Prince in the volume of material left in his vault, and he's been systematically releasing much of it. The mostly acoustic \u201cHomegrown\u201d was recorded as 1974 bled into 1975, during Young's breakup with actor Carrie Snodgress. Instead of releasing it in 1975, he put out another heartbreak album, the well-regarded \u201cTonight's the Night,\u201d about losing friends to drug abuse. When Young finally dropped \u201cHomegrown\u201d in 2020, he wrote in his blog, \u201cSometimes life hurts. This is the one that got away.\u201d",
      "Of the discs included in Springsteen's \u201cTracks II\u201d set, this was reportedly the closest to being released, in the spring of 1995. After the success of the Oscar-winning song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia,\u201d Springsteen recorded an album in the same vein, with a synthesizer and West Coast rap-inspired drum loops setting the musical motif. Strikingly contemporary for its time, Springsteen ultimately felt it was too similar to previous releases dominated by dark stories about relationships. \u201cI always put them away,\u201d he said of his lost albums. \u201cBut I don't throw them away.\u201d",

      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years",
      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years. The next entry, and first since Daniel Craig's dramatic exit, may test that \u2014 but things are speeding up.",
      "On Wednesday, Amazon MGM Studio announced that Denis Villeneuve will direct the 26th Bond movie, putting the franchise in the hands of one of the most respected big-budget filmmakers. Here's what to know about that decision, and where things stand for 007.",
      "Villeneuve, the 57-year-old French Canadian director, edged out other filmmakers who were reportedly eyed for the gig, including Edward Berger (\u201cConclave\u201d) and Paul King (\u201cPaddington 2\u201d). Since emerging with 2010's \u201cIncendies,\" Villeneuve has established himself as a steward of cinematic IP (\"Blade Runner 2049,\" \u201cDune\u201d) and a specialist in dark, doom-laden spectacle (\"Sicaro,\" \u201cArrival\u201d).",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "The culmination for Villeneuve has been the \u201cDune\u201d films. His first two entries have surpassed $1 billion in box office and gathered a combined 15 Academy Award nominations, winning seven. Villeneuve is expected to begin shooting the third \u201cDune\u201d film this summer, with a cast including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya and Javier Bardem.",
      "\"I\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Amazon, which bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, hasn't set a release date yet or announced a screenwriter. Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are shepherding the movie for the first time. In February, Amazon MGM Studios secured creative control of the franchise from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, whose family has presided over Bond since the first film, 1962's \u201cDr. No.\u201d",
      "The most likely timing would be production starting in 2026 and the film being released sometime in 2027.",
      "No new 007 has been named, but that hasn't stopped rumors and conjecture from running rampant.",
      "It's pure speculation buts oddsmakers have a few expected contenders for the martini-sipping role. Those include Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James, Aaron Pierre, Henry Cavill, James Norton and Jack Lowden. Expectations are that the new Bond will remain male and British, but producers have said nothing publicly to tip their hand.",
      "Whoever it is will have big shoes to fill. In his five-film, 15-year stretch in the tuxedo, Daniel Craig was widely seen as one of the best Bonds, including the high point of \u201cSkyfall\u201d (2012) and the swan song of \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (2021).",
      "Since Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli obtained the movie rights to Ian Fleming's books, James Bond has been a family business. That didn't change after Amazon bought MGM, but it did earlier this year when Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli agreed to let the studio take creative control.",
      "That handoff stoked concern from many Bond fans that 007 would be picked apart for spinoffs, series and the kind of intellectual property strip mining Hollywood has been known for in other franchises like \u201cStar Wars.\u201d So far, though, Amazon MGM has made no announcement about any spinoffs, and is prioritizing the 26th Bond movie.",

      "A prosecutor began two days of closing arguments at Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs' sex trafficking trial by telling a jury that the music mogul used \u201cpower, violence and fear\u201d to rule a criminal enterprise for two decades",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u201ccommitted crime after crime\u201d but thought his \u201cfame, wealth and power\u201d put him above the law, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday as the hip-hop mogul\u2019s sex trafficking trial shifted to closing arguments.",
      "\u201cThat ends now,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to find the defendant guilty.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, sat with his head down as Slavik highlighted testimony and evidence from the seven-week trial that she said proved sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Wearing a sweater and khakis, he sometimes scribbled notes to his lawyers and shook his head as Slavik played one of his audio messages for the jury.",
      "\u201cOver the last several weeks, you\u2019ve learned a lot about Sean Combs,\u201d Slavik said, launching into a nearly five-hour presentation. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\u201d",
      "Among the proof, Slavik argued, was evidence that Combs kidnapped an employee, was involved in setting rapper Kid Cudi\u2019s convertible ablaze, bribed a hotel guard and carried out \u201cbrutal crimes at the heart of this case.\u201d",
      "Combs \u201cagain and again forced, threatened and manipulated\u201d his ex-girlfriends Cassie and Jane into \u201chaving sex with escorts for his own entertainment,\u201d Slavik said, her lectern directly in front of jurors.",
      "The prosecutor said Combs forced or coerced Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, and Jane, who testified under a pseudonym, to engage in dayslong sex marathons known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights\u201d with drugs, violence, or by threatening financial harm or the release of video recordings of some of the hundreds of encounters.",
      "\u201cUp until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Bookending the trial\u2019s start, jurors again saw now-infamous security footage of Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Cassie at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016 after she tried to leave a freak-off with a male sex worker.",
      "\u201cHe knew exactly what he was doing. That is sex trafficking,\u201d Slavik told the jury, adding that Combs was \u201cknowingly using force and coercion to get Cassie back to that room where the escort was waiting.\u201d",
      "Slavik said Combs \u201ccounted on silence and shame\u201d to enable and prolong his abuse. He used a \u201csmall army\u201d of employees, including personal assistants and bodyguards, to harm women and cover it up, she said.",
      "The theory of racketeering law is that \u201cwhen someone commits crime as part of a group, they\u2019re more powerful and dangerous,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant was a powerful man, but he became more powerful and dangerous because of his inner circle, his businesses \u2014 the enterprise.\u201d",
      "Combs and his inner circle \u201ccommitted hundreds of racketeering acts,\u201d she said.",
      "Members of Combs\u2019 family, including several of his children, watched from wooden benches in the packed courtroom. At one point, he gave them a thumbs-up.",
      "Since his arrest at a Manhattan hotel last September, Combs and his lawyers have insisted he is innocent, though they conceded at trial that domestic violence occurred.",
      "Combs \u201cwas abusive: physical, emotional, psychological, sexual abuse,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant doesn\u2019t deny the abuse. They just want to call it \u2018domestic violence\u2019 and claim it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the crimes charged.\u201d",
      "The defense will give its closing argument on Friday, followed by a prosecution rebuttal argument. Then, Judge Arun Subramanian said, he will instruct jurors on the law before deliberations begin.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers contend there was no racketeering conspiracy because no employees agreed to join any conspiracy.",
      "In her closing, Slavik said employees repeatedly agreed to commit crimes for Combs, including delivering him drugs; accompanying him to kidnap his personal assistant; and locking Cassie in a hotel room after he stomped on her face.",
      "As Slavik returned repeatedly to the topic of Combs\u2019 sex marathons, jurors saw a slide that said \u201cThe Freak Offs\u201d next to a photo of him laying on a bed bathed in red light.",
      "Slavik reminded jurors of text messages and testimony that showed that the women didn't want to participate, including one in which Jane told Combs that she felt he gave her no choice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself. I feel it\u2019s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for the house,\u201d Jane wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.\u201d",

      "Issey Miyake\u2019s menswear line has returned to Paris Fashion Week with a dazzling show at the Cartier Foundation",
      "PARIS -- As Paris wilted under the ruthless June sun, Issey Miyake sent out a battalion of intergalactic fashion soldiers at the Cartier Foundation Thursday, shimmering between art and menswear apparel in a spectacle where even the light was a player. The late-morning sun bounced sharply off the art museum's monumental steel pillars, forcing some guests to slide their seats to escape the dazzling reflections \u2014 an impromptu game of musical chairs set to a pulsing, kinetic soundtrack.",
      "This Paris Fashion Week season finds the Miyake house in the midst of transition. In January, Paris bid adieu to Homme Pliss\u00e9 \u2014 Miyake\u2019s pleated cult favorite that had anchored the city\u2019s menswear calendar since 2019 \u2014 as the brand shifted its focus to nomadic shows, most recently appearing under the Tuscan sun. The torch in Paris has now been passed to IM Men, the last line personally conceived by Issey Miyake before his death in 2022. Thursday\u2019s show marked IM Men\u2019s return to the Paris stage, under the direction of designers Sen Kawahara, Yuki Itakura, and Nobutaka Kobayashi.",
      "The theme, \u201cDancing Texture,\u201d nodded to the ceramic artistry of Shoji Kamoda, but also to the surreal choreography on display. Models appeared to roll, tilt, and swing through the light, their movements somewhere between ballet and a slow-motion video game. Occasionally, a guest would squint, unsure if they were watching a runway show or a heat-induced hallucination.",
      "The crowd \u2014 equal parts Parisian cool, visiting editors, and those for whom a pleated culotte is a spiritual calling \u2014 dodged the sun's glare and fanned themselves in the heat, shifting for both comfort and the best sightline. The first model glided out in a mad, angular hat, setting the tone for a parade of tin man-meets-space ninja silhouettes designed for dance floors or distant planets.",
      "The clothes themselves looked as if they had been engineered for a new climate \u2014 or perhaps a new species. Surfaces peeled, rippled, and shimmered, metallic foils flashed against the sun, and jacquard weaves evoked the carved waves of Kamoda\u2019s ceramics. Vermilion and white motifs burst forth alongside a near-neon green, courtesy of upcycled fishing nets. A coat unzipped into a dramatic collar while some blousons and pants, when laid flat, formed perfect circles \u2014 a wink at Kamoda\u2019s wheel-thrown plates.",
      "Miyake, who died in 2022, loomed large over the collection, his vision unmistakable in every engineered pleat and playful transformation. IM Men is the last line he conceived \u2014 a living laboratory for innovation, risk, and occasional absurdity, now energetically interpreted by a younger team. Even in his absence, his legacy is alive in every joke, fold, and jolt of surprise on the runway.",
      "Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake rose from postwar Japan to become a global force, transforming fashion in the 1980s and \u201990s with his radical, sculptural vision. He pioneered heat-set pleating and created lines like Pleats Please and A-POC that blurred the boundaries between art, science, and daily life. Miyake\u2019s designs liberated fabric, allowing it to move with the body and imagination alike.",
      "Of course, the fashion house\u2019s embrace of the avant-garde still courts danger. Thursday's spectacle occasionally veered into excess, with kinetic art and sci-fi headgear that threatened to upstage the clothes themselves \u2014 a familiar Miyake risk. But the best moments, like a pared-back tangerine overcoat that floated past, proved restraint can sometimes steal the show.",

      "DuBose said the states had shown \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that \u201cHHS\u2019s action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\u201d DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court in Providence.",
      "Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.",
      "But the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.",
      "The high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.",
      "The action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.",
      "The rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.",
      "In the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.",
      "The justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia\u2019s and North Carolina\u2019s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.",
      "The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.",
      "The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.",
      "In one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care.",

      "A Ukrainian woman, Olha Kurtmalaieva, has endured cancer and war while fighting to bring her husband home from Russian captivity",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 \u201cYou have no moral right to die.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s what Olha Kurtmalaieva told herself as she lay in intensive care, her body shutting down after emergency chemotherapy. Her cancer had progressed to Stage 4, meaning it had spread to other parts of her body and was now incurable. The pain was unbearable. The doctors weren\u2019t sure she\u2019d make it through the night.",
      "She was facing death alone in the Ukrainian capital, while her soldier husband was in Russian captivity in the more than three-year war.",
      "\u201cIf I die now, who will bring him back?\" Olha thought to herself. \"He has no one else in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Against the odds, she learned she was in remission last year. But even after multiple prisoner exchanges, including one that freed over 1,000 people, her husband, a Ukrainian marine, remains a captive.",
      "She hasn\u2019t given up. At nearly every exchange, she\u2019s there waiting, one of hundreds of Ukrainian women still trying to bring home their husbands, sons and brothers.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s everywhere in my life,\u201d Olha said. \u201cHis (photo) is on my phone screen, in my wallet, on the kitchen wall, in every room.\u201d",
      "Day and night, questions circled in her mind: \u201cWhat can I do to speed this up? What did I do today to bring him home?\u201d",
      "Olha was just 21 when she learned she had cancer. It was Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, Stage 2. The tumors were growing but were still treatable.",
      "\u201cAt that age, you\u2019re thinking: cancer? Why me? How? What did I do?\u201d she recalled. Her husband, Ruslan Kurtmalaiev, promised to stay by her side through every round of chemotherapy.",
      "When they met, in 2015, he was 21 and she was just 15. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love at first sight,\u201d she said with a wide smile, eyes sparkling.",
      "Their attraction blossomed gradually that summer in Berdiansk, in what is now the Russian-occupied zone in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. Three years later, as soon as she turned 18, they wed.",
      "When they first met, it was not long after Russia illegally seized Crimea, Ruslan's homeland, in 2014, and also invaded eastern Ukraine. Ruslan, a professional soldier, had already served on the front line.",
      "From the beginning, Olha understood that life as a military wife meant constant sacrifice \u2014 long separations, missed milestones, and the uncertainty of war. But she never imagined that one day she would be waiting for her husband to return from captivity.",
      "When she describes Ruslan, tears well up in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s kind, he has a heightened sense of justice,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cFor him, it was a matter of principle to return home and bring our Crimea home,\u201d she said, a loss she fully comprehended only after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "\u201cOnly when I lost my home did I fully understand him.\"",
      "Olha managed to complete only two sessions of chemo before the full-scale invasion. When her long hair began to fall out, she shaved her head. When she sent Ruslan a photo, he didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he told her.",
      "Later, he made a confession.",
      "\u201cHe told me, \u2018Yeah, I saw your hair falling out in the mornings. I gathered it all from your pillow before you woke up \u2014 so you wouldn\u2019t get upset.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she believed that losing her hair was the worst thing that could happen to her. But soon after, she discovered what real tragedy meant.",
      "Olha never made it to her third round of chemo.",
      "She stayed in Berdiansk, which was seized by Russian forces in the early days of the war. Cut off from medical care and waiting for news of Ruslan, she quietly began helping the Ukrainian military from inside occupied territory.",
      "\u201cThere was no oncology department in Berdiansk. There was simply nowhere to get treated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut honestly, I didn\u2019t even care that much at the time.\u201d",
      "In early April, she discovered that Russians had captured Ruslan and others from his marine forces\u2019 unit.",
      "\u201cI started to cry, but then I stopped myself. I thought, \u2018Wait. Is this something to cry about? He\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she said, their idea of Russian captivity was naive. Only later did it become synonymous with torture, starvation and medical neglect.",
      "Olha left Berdiansk in June of 2022.",
      "\u201cWalking through your own city, but feeling like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s horrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were Russian flags everywhere. I kept Ukrainian music in my headphones. I was scared my Bluetooth might disconnect, and they\u2019d kill me. But it was worth it.\u201d",
      "She spent several months moving between cities, helping to organize peaceful rallies to raise awareness about Ukrainian POWs. Eventually, she settled in Kyiv. Throughout that time, she paid little attention to her cancer diagnosis, even as her health steadily declined.",
      "Then her condition worsened sharply. Her temperature spiked to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cWhen the doctor looked at my test results, she said, \u2018How are you even walking?\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Her lymphoma, left untreated during occupation, had progressed to Stage 4. Emergency chemotherapy began \u2014 and it hit her hard.",
      "\u201cMy second round of chemo was disastrous,\u201d she said. She developed an intestinal blockage, couldn\u2019t digest food, and was rushed to intensive care. \u201cIt was morphine all night from the pain. I couldn\u2019t stand. I couldn\u2019t sit. They moved me like a dead body.\u201d",
      "In the hospital, she overheard doctors say her condition was inoperable. Then a nurse came to her bedside and spoke plainly.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to try to restart your system manually,\u2019 she told me. \u2018But if it doesn\u2019t work, you may not wake up tomorrow. You must help us however you can.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was the thought of Ruslan, still in captivity, that helped Olha survive.",
      "In April 2024, five days before her birthday, Olha was told she was in remission. Now she juggles civic activism with running an online cosmetics store. She co-founded the Marine Corps Strength Association, representing over 1,000 Ukrainian POWs still in captivity.",
      "In close contact with former prisoners, Olha gathers fragments of information about Ruslan \u2014 she has had only one phone call with him in the past three years. She sent several letters but never received a reply.",
      "Like an investigator, she pieces together every detail. That\u2019s how she discovered that Ruslan had broken ribs and a crushed arm during regular beatings, according to the testimony of one of the POWs.",
      "As part of the psychological torture, he is made to listen to the Russian national anthem repeatedly. A Crimean Tatar and a Muslim, he is given only Christian religious texts to read \u2014 not the worst form of pressure, Olha acknowledges, but still a clear violation of his faith.",
      "One day, a Russian guard struck him eight times on the head with a hammer.",
      "\u201cThe other prisoners said they had never seen bruises like that in their lives,\u201d she said.",
      "Ruslan spent months in solitary confinement. And yet, somehow, he remains emotionally strong.",
      "\u201cHe tells the others about me,\u201d Olha said, her voice softening. \u201cOne of the guys who came back said (Ruslan) told him: \u2018She\u2019s your age, but she\u2019s got a business, she\u2019s strong, she\u2019s fighting for us. She\u2019ll get us out.\u2019\u201d",
      "That story stayed with her.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t afford to be weak. How can a marine\u2019s wife be weak?\u201d Olha said. \u201cWhat matters is that he knows I\u2019ll keep fighting for him \u2014 until the very end.\"",

      "A new Idaho law restricting public benefits for undocumented immigrants is facing a legal challenge",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- An Idaho doctor and four residents are challenging a new state law that halts some of the few public benefits available to people living in the U.S. unlawfully, including a program that provides access to life-saving HIV and AIDS medication for low income patients.",
      "The ACLU of Idaho filed the federal lawsuit Thursday night on behalf of Dr. Abby Davids and four people with HIV who are not named because they are immigrants without lawful permanent residency.",
      "The complaint says the new law is vague, contradicts federal law and makes it impossible for health care providers to determine exactly what kind of immigration status is excluded and how to verify that status for patients. They want a judge to grant them class-action status, expanding any ruling to other impacted people.",
      "Dozens of patients treated by one Boise-area clinic stand to lose access to HIV and AIDS medication under the law, according to the complaint, including several cared for by Davids.",
      "\u201cWithdrawing HIV treatment from her patients will not only have devastating consequences on their health, it raises the public health risk of increased HIV transmission,\u201d the ACLU wrote in the lawsuit. \u201cWhen her patients are undetectable, they cannot transmit the virus. Without HIV treatment, however, they cannot maintain an undetectable viral level and therefore are able to transmit the virus to others.\u201d",
      "The new Idaho law takes effect July 1, and appears to be the first limiting public health benefits since President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to enhance eligibility verification and ensure that public benefits aren't going to ineligible immigrants.",
      "The law requires people to verify that they are legal U.S. residents to receive public benefits like communicable disease testing, vaccinations, prenatal and postnatal care for women, crisis counseling, some food assistance for children and even access to food banks or soup kitchens that rely on public funding.",
      "Federal law generally prohibits immigrants in the U.S. illegally from receiving taxpayer-funded benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Social Security. But there are some exceptions for things like emergency medical care and other emergency or public health services.",
      "Idaho\u2019s law still allows for emergency medical services. But in a June 18 letter to health care providers, Idaho Division of Public Health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said HIV is a long-term condition and not an emergency \u2014 so people must verify their lawful presence in order to get benefits through the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.",
      "The HIV patients challenging the new law include a married couple from Columbia with pending asylum applications, a man who was brought to the U.S. when he was just 4 years old and has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status until next year, and a man from Mexico who has been living and working in Idaho since 2020.",
      "One of the patients said she and her husband were diagnosed with HIV in 2019 and immediately started antiretroviral therapy, receiving the medications at no cost through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The medication has lowered the viral load in her body enough that it is now undetectable, she wrote in a court filing, ensuring that she won't transmit the virus to others.",
      "\u201cMy medication protected my daughter while I was pregnant because it prevented me from transmitting HIV to her during pregnancy,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The treatment allows her to be with her child, watching her grow, she said.",
      "Davids has been trying for weeks to get clarity from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare about exactly what kind of verification her patients will have to show, and exactly which kinds of immigration status are considered \u201clawful.\u201d But the state has yet to provide clear direction, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cI am really scared about what this means for many of our patients. Their lives will now be in jeopardy,\u201d Davids wrote in a May 30 email to the Department of Health and Welfare.",

      "Prosecutors said it was the first time a school district in the U.S. has faced such environmental criminal allegations.",
      "The district is charged with eight counts of violating the federal Toxic Substances Control Act for allegedly failing to perform inspections in a timely manner during a recent five-year period.",

      "Asbestos, a construction material in wide use until the 1980s, has been linked to cancer and lung disease.",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s vaccine advisers are bringing up an old flu-shot debate: whether it\u2019s time to wipe out the last small fraction of those vaccines that contain a controversial preservative called thimerosal.",
      "It\u2019s a question seemingly laid to rest years ago, as studies showed no evidence that the preservative causes any health problems.",
      "\u201cThis is really a nonissue,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Here are some things to know about the substance.",
      "Thimerosal is a preservative used in certain vaccines since the 1930s, as well as in some other medical products.",
      "It was mostly used in multi-dose vials of vaccine, to prevent bacterial contamination as the vessel was repeatedly punctured to withdraw a dose.",
      "Questions about thimerosal were raised in the late 1990s because it contains a form of mercury.",
      "It\u2019s not the same as the toxic type found in some seafood, called methylmercury. Instead, it\u2019s a different type called ethylmercury that the body can excrete, O\u2019Leary explained.",
      "The amount of ethylmercury per vaccine dose was small and studies found no evidence of harm. Nor was it used in all vaccines. For example, vaccines for chickenpox, polio and measles, mumps and rubella never contained it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "But as a precaution, the U.S. phased the preservative out of childhood vaccines. Since 2001, all vaccines routinely recommended for children age 6 and younger in the U.S. come in formulas that don\u2019t contain thimerosal.",
      "The exception is a small subset of flu shot formulas in multi-dose vials that could be used for adults or kids. The vast majority of children, however, get their flu vaccination from a single-dose shot instead, O\u2019Leary said.",
      "According to the CDC, 96% of all flu vaccines in the U.S. administered last fall and winter \u2014 and an even higher share of those used in federally funded programs \u2014 were thimerosal-free.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a longtime antivaccine activist, and he has long contended there was a tie between thimerosal and autism.",
      "On Thursday, his newly appointed vaccine advisers were set to hear a presentation from Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner who once ran the antivaccine group that Kennedy founded.",
      "She will suggest that the remaining thimerosal-containing flu shots should be removed, according to meeting materials posted earlier this week. Among the claims were that they could be a risk to pregnant women.",
      "A new CDC staff analysis prepared for the meeting again showed no link between the preservative and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Some experts note that autism rates rose after thimerosal was removed from young children's vaccines in the U.S.",

      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee backed another option to protect infants against a dangerous virus \u2014 before turning to questions about fall flu vaccines and a preservative in a small fraction of them that some antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday took up protections against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can dangerously inflame infants' tiny airways.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. That first antibody, called nirsevimab, proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.",
      "On Thursday, the vaccine panel voted 5-2 that another newly approved antibody shot, Merck\u2019s clesrovimab, should be used similarly.",
      "The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available.",
      "Kennedy was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official. He fired the previous 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a seven-member group that includes several vaccine skeptics.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps propel the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "Presentations prepared for Thursday's meeting suggest that the panel may do much the same this year. But there's also a flu-related vote that promises controversy.",
      "It concerns thimerosal, a form of mercury that\u2019s been added to vaccines since the early 20th century to preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials.",
      "Kennedy has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger. Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with limited exceptions.",
      "Thimerosal was placed on the meeting agenda shortly after Kennedy\u2019s new vaccine advisory was named last week.",
      "Before the vote, the committee will hear from Lyn Redwood, the former president of what is now known as Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 an antivaccine group founded by Kennedy.",
      "Some public health experts contend the thimerosal discussion will unnecessarily raise doubt in vaccines while possibly also making them more expensive and harder to get this fall.",
      "At the panel's meeting Wednesday, Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition, lamented the ouster of the former ACIP panel and the agenda of the new one.",
      "Her organization, which represents large city health departments, \u201cis deeply concerned that many routine vaccines may soon become inaccessible or unaffordable for millions of Americans if ACIP makes changes based on ideology rather than science,\" she said. \"The stakes are simply too high to let that happen.\u201d",

      "An emboldened Russia has ramped up military offensives on two fronts in Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- An emboldened Russia has ramped up military offensives on two fronts in Ukraine, scattering Kyiv\u2019s precious reserve troops and threatening to expand the fighting to a new Ukrainian region as each side seeks an advantage before the fighting season wanes in the autumn.",
      "Moscow aims to maximize its territorial gains before seriously considering a full ceasefire, analysts and military commanders said. Ukraine wants to slow the Russian advance for as long as possible and extract heavy losses.",
      "Kremlin forces are steadily gaining ground in the strategic eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk, the capture of which would hand them a major battlefield victory and bring them closer to acquiring the entire Donetsk region. The fighting there has also brought combat to the border of the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region for the first time.",
      "In an effort to prevent Moscow from bolstering those positions in the east, Ukrainian forces are trying to pin down some of Russia\u2019s best and most battle-hardened troops hundreds of kilometers away, in the northeast Sumy region.",
      "\u201cThe best-case scenario for Ukraine,\" said Russian-British military historian Sergey Radchenko, \"is that they\u2019re able to stall or stop the Russian advance\" in the Ukrainian industrial heartland known as Donbas, which includes the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Then Ukraine could \"use that as the basis for a ceasefire agreement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a better chance for Russia to come to some kind of terms with Ukraine\" in the fall when the Russians \"see the extent of their offensive,\u201d Radchenko added.",
      "While the battles rage, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is waiting to learn whether the Trump administration will support tougher sanctions against Russia and back a European idea to establish a \u201creassurance force\u201d to deter Moscow. One setback came with the U.S. decision to halt some weapons shipments out of concern over the U.S.'s own depleted stockpiles.",
      "In the Sumy region, Ukrainian forces face a constant barrage of aerial glide bombs, drones and relentless assaults by small groups of Russian infantrymen. They endure the attacks to prevent Russian forces from being moved to other battlegrounds in the eastern Donetsk region.",
      "Ukrainian forces intensified their own attacks in Sumy in April and even conducted a small offensive into Russia's neighboring Kursk region to prevent up to 60,000 battle-hardened Russian forces from being moved to reinforce positions in the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, Ukraine\u2019s top army commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said last week.",
      "If those troops had been moved, they could have increased the tempo of Russian attacks across the front line and stretched Ukrainian forces thin.",
      "The strategy did not come without criticism. Commanders who were ordered to execute it complained that it resulted in unnecessary loss of life.",
      "Russian forces have penetrated up to 7 kilometers into the northern Sumy region from different directions along the border.",
      "Ukrainian forces are determined to keep them there to avoid freeing up Russian forces to fight in the east. So far they have succeeded, locking up to 10,000 Russian troops in the Glushkovsky district of the Kursk region alone, where Ukraine maintains a small presence after being mostly forced out by Russian and North Korean troops earlier in the year.",
      "The war's largest battle is being waged in Donetsk as Russia inches toward its stated goal of capturing all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.",
      "Unable to tackle the strategically significant logistical hub of Pokrovsk directly, Russian forces are attempting to encircle the city, a maneuver that requires encroaching on the borders of the Dnipropetrovsk region. Bringing the war to a sixth Ukrainian region would be detrimental for Ukrainian morale and give Russia more leverage in negotiations if its forces manage to carve out a foothold there.",
      "Sabotage groups have crossed the border, only to be eliminated by Ukrainian forces.",
      "But in time, commanders fear that Russia will advance as Ukraine continues to grapple with severe shortages.",
      "Lack of soldiers and supplies across the 1,200-kilometer (745-mile) front line mean that Ukrainian forces must concentrate on holding their positions and conserving resources rather than advancing, said Oleksii Makhrinskyi, deputy commander of the Da Vinci Wolves battalion.",
      "Commanders describe battles so intense under drone-saturated skies that rotating forces in and out of position has become a deadly operation. Ukrainian forces remain in combat positions for several weeks at a time or more, relying on supplies carried in by drones.",
      "The Russians' goal \"is just to enter Dnipropetrovsk region, to have a good position politically if the presidents negotiate peace,\u201d said Andrii Nazerenko, a commander of the 72nd Brigade, a drone unit in eastern Ukraine, referring to potential talks between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re really close to getting what they want,\u201d he said.",
      "Zelenskyy hopes U.S. President Donald Trump will move away from his administration's past ambivalence toward Ukraine and signal his intention to continue American support, a move that could also alter Moscow\u2019s calculations. The two presidents met last week on the sidelines of a NATO summit and discussed a possible weapons package, including Patriot missile systems that Ukraine intends to purchase with European support.",
      "The U.S. Defense Department did not specify which weapons were being held back, when they disclosed the Pentagon review of U.S. weapons stockpiles Tuesday.",
      "Zelenskyy also hopes Trump will punish Russia by imposing harsher sanctions on its energy and banking sectors, which bankroll the Kremlin\u2019s war effort.",
      "Europe and the U.S. have imposed successive sanctions on Russia since the full-scale invasion in 2022, but Zelenskyy says those measures have not been enough to pierce Moscow\u2019s war machine. He has proposed a $30 per barrel price cap on Russian oil.",
      "EU sanctions envoy David O\u2019Sullivan said Europe needs to maintain the sanctions pressure while also \u201cholding out the prospect that if Russia behaves correctly, we could have some kind of ceasefire and some kind of sense of negotiation, but for the moment Russia doesn\u2019t seem to want that.\u201d",
      "Kyiv\u2019s closest European allies are also awaiting a sign from Trump that he will support a plan to deploy foreign troops in Ukraine to guard against future Russian aggression after a ceasefire agreement. That is likely the best security guarantee Ukraine can hope for in lieu of NATO membership.",
      "Meanwhile on the battlefield, Russian forces appear increasingly confident.",
      "Nazerenko noticed a shift in the morale of advancing Russian infantrymen in recent months. Instead of running away while being assailed by Ukrainian drones, they keep pushing forward.",
      "Nazerenko could not help but ask a Russian prisoner, \u201cYou know you will die. Why go?\u201d",
      "Because, the Russian soldier replied, \u201cwe will win.\u201d",

      "The snake was found on Tuesday as passengers were boarding Virgin Australia Flight VA337 at Melbourne Airport bound for Brisbane, according to snake catcher Mark Pelley.",
      "The snake turned out to be a harmless 60-centimeter (2-foot) green tree snake. But Pelly said he thought it could be venomous when he approached it in the darkened hold.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after I caught the snake that I realized that it wasn\u2019t venomous. Until that point, it looked very dangerous to me,\u201d Pelley said.",

      "\u201cThe steamroller of repressions doesn't stop, and the authorities continue to stifle any dissent in Belarus, opening new high-profile cases,\u201d Sapelka told the AP on Tuesday. \u201cNo one, absolutely no one can feel safe in Belarus.\u201d",
      "Mass arrests and convictions of government critics in Belarus have continued since 2020, when Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was handed a sixth term in office in an election that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged.",
      "Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest, in the biggest demonstrations that the country\u2019s ever seen. Authorities unleashed a violent crackdown in response, detaining and beating thousands and driving many more into exile abroad. The crackdown drew international condemnation, and the U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus.",
      "Viasna has recorded 1,174 people behind bars as political prisoners. The number includes 38 journalists and the group's founder, Ales Bialiatski, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022. At least eight political prisoners have died behind bars.",
      "Lukashenko, who in January secured another term in office in another election the opposition denounced as a sham, has recently been pardoning some of the political prisoners, seeking to improve ties with the West. In total, he has pardoned and freed more than 300 prisoners since July 2024, including some U.S. citizens and other foreigners.",
      "Last month, Belarusian authorities released prominent opposition figure Siarhei Tsikhanouski and 13 others and brought them to Lithuania. Their release came just hours after Belarusian authorities announced that Lukashenko met with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, in the Belarusian capital, Minsk.",
      "But rights advocates argue that the situation in Belarus hasn't changed, and authorities have recently opened several new high-profile cases, which indicates their intention to continue the crackdown.",
      "At least 20 people have been arrested in the case against Belaruski Hajun, a Belarusian activist group that monitors troops movements in Belarus, Sapelka said.",
      "Viasna on Monday also reported the arrest of popular Belarusian signer Aleh Hamenka, who is being accused of taking part in anti-government protests. Another case involves sociologists from the Wardomacki sociological research laboratory, according to Sapelka.",
      "Nils Mui\u017enieks, U.N.'s special rapporteur for human rights in Belarus, has recently said that \u201cthere is no sign of improvement in the human rights situation in Belarus, and the authorities are disregarding offers of cooperation.\u201d",

      "A 92-year-old former railway worker has been sentenced to life in a British prison for raping and murdering a woman in 1967",
      "LONDON -- For more than a half-century, Ryland Headley got away with murder. When justice finally caught up to the former railway worker Tuesday in a British courtroom, he was 92 years old and using hearing aids to listen to his fate.",
      "A judge sentenced Headley to life in prison for the rape and murder of Louisa Dunne, a 75-year-old widow and grandmother who was strangled in her home in western England in 1967. It is believed to be the longest time in the U.K. between crime and conviction.",
      "\u201cThe violation of her home, her body and, ultimately, her life was a pitiless and cruel act by a depraved man,\u201d Justice Derek Sweeting said in Bristol Crown Court.",
      "Headley broke into Dunne\u2019s home through a window and left a palm print on the glass. Police took the hand prints of 19,000 men and boys in the area to try to solve the crime, but did not find a match at the time.",
      "Headley moved out of the area and went on to rape two older women in similar circumstances in the late 1970s and serve time in prison. But his DNA was not collected until an unrelated arrest in 2012.",
      "Last year, semen found on the blue skirt that Dunne had been wearing when she was killed was found to match Headley's DNA. His palm print was found to match the one on her window.",
      "At his trial, prosecutors had read testimony from the victims of his previous rape convictions, providing jurors with an insight into what happened when he broke into Dunne's home, said Det. Insp. Dave Marchant.",
      "\u201cHearing the voices of the victims of his 1977 offenses, is just incredibly powerful and harrowing,\u201d Marchant said.",
      "Dunne\u2019s granddaughter, Mary Dainton, who is now about the age her grandmother was when she was killed, said she had been stunned to learn of Headley's arrest in November.",
      "\u201cI accepted that some murders just never get solved and some people have to live with that emptiness and sadness,\u201d she said.",
      "On Tuesday, Dainton told the court that her grandmother's murder and rape had cast a cloud over the rest of her mother's life.",
      "\u201cThe fact the offender wasn\u2019t caught caused my mother to become and remain very ill,\" she said. \"It saddens me deeply that all the people who knew and loved Louisa are not here to see that justice is being done.\u201d",
      "Sweeting said that by escaping punishment for so long, Headley had compounded the suffering of Dunne's family.",
      "He told Headley he had to serve a minimum of 20 years in prison and would normally spend time explaining the effect of such a term. But he was blunt in this case.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll never be released and you will die in prison,\u201d Sweeting said.",

      "Timur Ivanov is the most visible figure in a far-ranging probe into alleged military graft that also targeted several other top officials close to former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Shoigu, a veteran official who had personal ties to President Vladimir Putin, survived the purges of his inner circle and was given the new high-profile post of secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council.",
      "Ivanov, 49, was named deputy defense minister in 2016 and oversaw military construction projects, as well as property management, housing and medical support for the military. He was known for his lavish lifestyle that outraged many in Moscow just as the fighting in Ukraine exposed glaring deficiencies in Russian military organization and supplies that resulted in battlefield setbacks.",
      "Ivanov, who has been in custody since his arrest in April 2024, was convicted by the Moscow City Court of embezzling 3.9 billion rubles (about $50 million), the charges that he denied. The court also confiscated his assets that included prized real estate and a collection of vintage cars.",
      "Ivanov's lawyers said they would appeal the verdict.",

      "The issue arose last year when, in an interview with a French right-wing media outlet, Sansal questioned Algeria\u2019s current borders, arguing that France had redrawn them during the colonial period to include lands that once belonged to Morocco. The 80-year-old dual citizen was arrested the following month and later lambasted by the president in a speech to Algeria\u2019s parliament.",
      "The case has unfolded at a historic low point in Algeria's relations with France, which were strained further over the disputed Western Sahara.",
      "The territorial dispute has long helped shape Algeria\u2019s foreign policy, with its backing of the Polisario Front, a pro-independence group that operates out of refugee camps in southwestern Algeria.

      "Three senior leaders at the English hospital where nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter",
      "LONDON -- Three senior leaders at the English hospital where nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering seven babies and trying to kill seven others were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, police said Tuesday.",
      "The unnamed suspects being investigated for gross negligence manslaughter were arrested after a corporate manslaughter probe was expanded following Letby\u2019s 2023 convictions for the infant deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England, said Detective Superintendent Paul Hughes of the Cheshire Constabulary. The three were released on bail.",
      "\u201cThis focuses on senior leadership and their decision-making to determine whether any criminality has taken place concerning the response to the increased levels of fatalities,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "Letby, 35, is serving multiple life sentences after being convicted of seven counts of murder and attempting to murder seven other infants between June 2015 and June 2016 while working as a neonatal nurse at the hospital.",
      "Prosecutors said she harmed babies in ways that left little trace, including injecting air into their bloodstreams, administering air or milk into their stomachs through nasogastric tubes, poisoning them with insulin and interfering with breathing tubes.",
      "Letby, who testified that she never harmed a child, has continued to proclaim her innocence and support for her has grown as legal and scientific experts have questioned the circumstantial and statistical evidence used at her trial. A panel of international medical experts disputed the evidence against her and her lawyer said she was wrongly convicted.",
      "A judge who oversaw a public inquiry seeking accountability of staff and management at the hospital is expected to publish her findings this fall. Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said at the outset of the inquiry that she would not review Letby's conviction, but take a deeper look into how failures led babies to repeatedly be harmed at the hospital.",
      "As that inquiry was underway earlier this year, an independent panel of more than a dozen medical experts issued a report that found no sign of a crime and concluded natural causes or bad medical care led to the demise of each of the newborns.",
      "\u201cIn summary, then, ladies and gentlemen, we did not find any murders,\u201d Dr. Shoo Lee, a retired neonatologist from Canada, said at a London news conference in February.",
      "Letby's lawyers and three former executives at the hospital unsuccessfully petitioned Thirlwall to halt the public inquiry after the medical panel released its findings. They argued that if the convictions are overturned, the inquiry might reach the wrong conclusions and waste more than 10 million pounds ($13.8 million) in taxpayer funds.",
      "Letby, who lost two bids to appeal her convictions, now has her case before the Criminal Case Review Commission, which reviews possible miscarriages of justice and could lead to one another shot at an appeal.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service has said two juries convicted Letby and three appellate judges had rejected her arguments that the prosecution expert evidence was flawed.",
      "While the medical panel said there was no evidence Letby intentionally harmed any babies, they did find that medical workers at the hospital were not properly skilled in resuscitation and inserting breathing tubes, lacked an understanding of some basic procedures, misdiagnosed ailments and acted slowly in treating acutely ill babies.",

With recent direct peace talks delivering no progress on U.S.-led international efforts to halt the fighting, Russia and Ukraine are bulking up their arsenals.",

      "The drone struck the Kupol Electromechanical Plant, which produces air defense systems and drones for the Russian military, according to an official with Ukraine\u2019s Security Service, the SBU.",

In May last year, a Ukrainian drone hit an early-warning radar in the Russian city of Orsk, some 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from the Ukrainian border, Kyiv officials claimed.",

Those who won't be able to do so include the lowest-income seniors who already don\u2019t pay taxes on Social Security, those who choose to claim their benefits before they reach age 65 and those above a defined income threshold.",
      "The Senate proposal includes a temporary $6,000 deduction for seniors over the age of 65, contrasted with the House proposal, which includes a temporary deduction of $4,000.",
      "The Senate proposal approved Tuesday would eliminate Social Security tax liability for seniors with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less or $150,000 if filing as a married couple.",
      "If passed into law, the tax deduction would last four years, from 2025 to 2029.",
      "The deductions phase out as income increases.",
      "Touting a new Council of Economic Advisers analysis, the White House said Tuesday that \u201c88% of all seniors who receive Social Security \u2014 will pay NO TAX on their Social Security benefits,\" going on to say that the Senate proposal\u2019s $6,000 senior deduction \u201cis estimated to benefit 33.9 million seniors, including seniors not claiming Social Security. The deduction yields an average increase in after-tax income of $670 per senior who benefits from it.\u201d",
      "Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation think tank, said conflating the tax deduction with a claim that there will be no tax on Social Security could end up confusing and angering a lot of seniors who will expect to not pay taxes on their Social Security benefits.",
      "\u201cWhile the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\u201d Watson said.",
      "The cost of actually eliminating the tax on Social Security would have massive impacts on the economy.",
      "University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits \u201cwould reduce revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase federal debt by 7 percent by 2054\" and speed up the projected depletion date of the Social Security Trust Fund from 2034 to 2032.",

      "Administration officials have said the cost of the tax bill would be offset by tariff income.",
      "Recently, the CBO separately estimated that Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall.",

But prospects for the resort, the biggest tourist complex in North Korea, aren\u2019t clear, as the country won\u2019t likely fully reopen its borders and embrace Western tourists anytime soon, observers say.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency reported the Wonsan-Kalma area began service Tuesday, drawing a large number of North Koreans who enjoyed open water swimming, slides and other attractions at a water park and various water activities in the area.",
      "\u201cThe guests\u2019 hearts were filled with overwhelming emotion as they felt the astonishing new heights of our-style tourism culture blossoming under the era of the Workers\u2019 Party,\" KCNA said in a typical propaganda-driven dispatch.",
      "Photos released by North Korean state media showed children with tubes and inflatable balls dipping into the sea, while others in colorful swimsuits beamed while sitting beneath red-and-white parasols.",
      "Kim said at the inaugural ceremony last week the site would be recorded as \u201cone of the greatest successes this year\" and called its opening \u201cthe proud first step\u201d toward realizing the government\u2019s policy of developing tourism.",
      "Since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing the curbs imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and reopening its borders in phases. But the country hasn\u2019t said whether and when it would fully resume international tourism.",
      "Chinese group tours, which made up more than 90% of visitors before the pandemic, remain stalled while there are questions about ties between the two socialist neighbors. In February this year, North Korea allowed a small group of international tourists to visit its northeastern border city of Rason, only to stop that tour program in less than a month.",
      "Since February 2024, North Korea has been accepting Russian tourists amid expanding military cooperation between the countries. But Russian government records seen by South Korean experts show a little more than 2,000 Russians, only about 880 of them tourists, visited North Korea last year, a number that is too small to revive North Korea's tourism.",
      "Russia\u2019s Primorsky region, which borders North Korea, said last week that the first group of Russian tourists to the Wonsan-Kalma resort will depart on July 7 for a eight-day trip that includes a visit to Pyongyang.",

      "President Donald Trump has announced four nominees for the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s board, which for months has lacked a quorum because Trump fired some of former President Joe Biden\u2019s picks",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced four nominees for the Tennessee Valley Authority's board, which for months has not had enough members to take many actions because Trump fired some of former President Joe Biden's picks.",
      "TVA is the nation's largest public utility and provides power to more than 10 million people across seven southern states.",
      "The White House said Trump's nominees for the federal utility are Tennesseans Lee Beaman, Mitch Graves and Jeff Hagood; and Randall Jones of Alabama.",
      "The selections follow Trump's firing of three Biden-nominated board members since late March. The board normally has nine members and requires five to make a quorum. It currently has three. Trump's picks would not be seated until the U.S. Senate confirms them.",
      "Without a quorum, TVA's board can take actions needed for ongoing operations but cannot jump into new areas of activity, start new programs or change the utility's existing direction.",
      "Beaman is a businessman who sold his Nashville-area fleet of car dealerships. He is also a prominent Republican political fundraiser.",
      "Graves is the CEO of West Cancer Center & Research Institute in Germantown, Tennessee, and he sits on the board of Memphis Light, Gas and Water.",
      "Hagood is a Knoxville attorney and sits on the Knoxville Sports Authority Board. He was helping fundraising efforts for Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs, the former WWE wrestler who had been flirting with a run for governor.",
      "Jones is an insurance agent and sits on the Jacksonville State University board, the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame board and the city of Guntersville Electric Board.",
      "In a March 20 guest column, Tennessee\u2019s two Republican U.S. senators urged TVA officials to opt for \u201can interim CEO trusted by the president\u201d before hiring someone long-term. They wrote that studies and hurdles under the TVA board were bogging down a project that seeks to build a small modular nuclear reactor.",
      "Then, Trump fired board member Michelle Moore on March 27.",
      "On March 31, the five remaining board members picked TVA\u2019s executive vice president and chief operating officer Don Moul to become the new CEO. Moul has since called for reevaluating the lifespan of TVA\u2019s fleet of coal plants. The utility has been planning to retire the last of them by 2035. But Trump has signed executive orders aimed at boosting the coal industry.",
      "On April 1, Trump fired board member Joe Ritch, leaving the board without a quorum. Months later, he fired Beth Geer from the board on June 10.",
      "This weekend, a guest column by Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee called for a \u201ca new board and a clear, aggressive mission\u201d to further Trump's goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years. Trump signed executive orders in May to speed up the development.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more",
      "WASHINGTON -- Day camp providers and schools are warning that a Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income American families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.",
      "The administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as part of a review to ensure grants align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "The move leaves states and schools in limbo as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year, introducing new uncertainty about when \u2014 or if \u2014 they will receive the money. It also sets the stage for a clash with Democrats, who say the administration is flouting the law by holding back money Congress appropriated.",
      "Without the money, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work, and they may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Even classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy.",
      "For instance, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of the withheld money to run camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If funding isn\u2019t restored soon, the programming may end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \u201cIf these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\u201d Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs that rely on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department did not provide a timeline and warned that \u201cdecisions have not yet been made\u201d on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\u201cThe Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President\u2019s priorities and the Department\u2019s statutory responsibilities,\u201d Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program serving more than 1,200 low-income students if federal funds aren't released. There\u2019s no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\u201cThose hours between after school and 6 o\u2019clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\u201d Browning said. \u201cIt would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\u201d",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Trump\u2019s 2026 budget proposal called for Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressed the administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\u201cEvery day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they\u2019ll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\u201d Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It\u2019s the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800,000 in limbo, while Texas has over $660,000.",
      "\u201cTrump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \u201cThe Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump\u2019s political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \u201cput several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\u201d said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send a message,\u201d said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\u201d",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she\u2019ll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an essential service in our community because we don\u2019t have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\u201d she said.",
      "Sipe said it\u2019s particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\u201cIt feels preventable,\u201d she said, \u201cand it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America\u2019s children.\u201d",

      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum accused U.S. officials of providing no evidence to back their allegations, though the sanctions announcement made specific accusations on how money was transferred through the companies. It detailed how \u201cmules\u201d moved money through accounts in the U.S., as well as transactions carried out with Chinese companies that U.S. officials said provided materials to produce fentanyl.",
      "Mexico\u2019s banking authority has announced that it is temporarily taking over management of CIBanco and Intercam Banco to protect creditors.",
      "Sheinbaum said Tuesday that the Mexican government is doing everything within its power to ensure that creditors aren\u2019t affected, and said they were well \u201cwithin their right\u201d to pull their money from the banks.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department said that the sanctions would go into effect 21 days after the announcement.",
      "Fitch Ratings has downgraded the three institutions and other affiliates, citing \u201canti-money laundering concerns\u201d and saying the drop \u201creflects the imminent negative impact\u201d that the sanctions could have.",
      "\u201cThe new ratings reflect the significantly more vulnerable credit profile of these entities in response to the aforementioned warnings, given the potential impact on their ability to meet their financial obligations,\u201d the credit rating agency wrote in a statement.",
      "On Monday, CIBanco announced that Visa Inc. had announced to them with little warning that it had \u201cunilaterally decided to disconnect its platform for all international transactions\u201d through CIBanco. The bank accused Visa of not complying with the 21-day grace period laid out by the sanctions.",

      "The regional court in Braunschweig on Tuesday cited an unspecified health issue that meant Winterkorn, 78, was not in a condition to face trial.",
      "The court said in a statement that it had \"provisionally terminated\u201d the proceedings. It said the health issue represented a \u201ctemporary impediment\u201d and would continue to be reviewed with the help of an expert so that proceedings could resume if Winterkorn recovers.",

      "The mineral-rich Arctic island is open for tourism. Whale-watching tours, excursions to the iconic puffin island and guided charters through remote settlements are just the beginning of what Greenland has to offer visitors.

      "TOKYO -- Business sentiment among large Japanese manufacturers has improved slightly, according to a survey by Japan\u2019s central bank released Tuesday, although worries persist over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The Bank of Japan\u2019s quarterly tankan survey said an index for large manufacturers rose to plus 13 from plus 12 in March, when it marked the first dip in a year. The survey is an indicator of companies foreseeing good conditions minus those feeling pessimistic.",
      "Major manufacturers include auto and electronics sectors, whose exports to the U.S. drive the Japanese economy.",
      "U.S. auto tariffs are a worry for major manufacturers like Toyota Motor Corp., but some analysts note global auto sales have held up relatively well in recent months.",
      "The U.S. has imposed 25% tariffs on auto imports. Japanese automakers have plants in Mexico, where Trump has announced a separate set of tariffs. The U.S. has also imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Japanese officials have been talking frequently with the Trump administration, stressing that Japan is a key U.S. ally.",
      "Trump posted on his social media site Monday that Japan wasn\u2019t buying enough rice from the U.S. \u201cThey won\u2019t take our RICE, and yet they have a massive rice shortage,\u201d the president wrote, adding that a letter to Japan was coming.",
      "Also on Monday, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett told reporters at the White House that Trump \u201cis going to finalize the frameworks we negotiated with a whole bunch of countries after the weekend.\u201d",

      "The weak yen has raised the cost of materials for Japan at a time when the U.S. dollar has been trading at around 140 yen, up considerably from about 110 yen five years ago. A weak yen is a boon for Japan\u2019s exporters by boosting the value of their earnings when converted into yen.",
      "The tankan showed sentiment for large non-manufacturers fell to plus 34 from plus 35. That was better than some forecasts, which projected a deeper decline.",

      "A Himalayan village in Nepal has vanished \u2014 emptied by climate change",
      "SAMJUNG, Nepal -- The Himalayan village of Samjung did not die in a day.",
      "Perched in a wind-carved valley in Nepal's Upper Mustang, more than 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) above sea level, the Buddhist village lived by slow, deliberate rhythms \u2014 herding yaks and sheep and harvesting barley under sheer ochre cliffs honeycombed with \u201csky caves\u201d \u2014 2,000-year-old chambers used for ancestral burials, meditation and shelter.",
      "Then the water dried up. Snow-capped mountains turned brown and barren as, year after year, snowfall declined. Springs and canals vanished and when it did rain, the water came all at once, flooding fields and melting away the mud homes. Families left one by one, leaving the skeletal remains of a community transformed by climate change: crumbling mud homes, cracked terraces and unkempt shrines.",
      "The Hindu Kush and Himalayan mountain regions \u2014 stretching from Afghanistan to Myanmar \u2014 hold more ice than anywhere else outside the Arctic and Antarctic. Their glaciers feed major rivers that support 240 million people in the mountains \u2014 and 1.65 billion more downstream.",
      "Such high-altitude areas are warming faster than lowlands. Glaciers are retreating and permafrost areas are thawing as snowfall becomes scarcer and more erratic, according to the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development or ICMOD.",
      "Kunga Gurung is among many in the high Himalayas already living through the irreversible effects of climate change.",
      "\u201cWe moved because there was no water. We need water to drink and to farm. But there is none there. Three streams, and all three dried up,\u201d said Gurung, 54.",
      "Climate change is quietly reshaping where people can live and work by disrupting farming, water access, and weather patterns, said Neil Adger, a professor of human geography at the University of Exeter. In places like Mustang, that's making life harder, even if people don\u2019t always say climate change is why they moved. \u201cOn the everyday basis, the changing weather patterns ... it's actually affecting the ability of people to live in particular places,\u201d Adger said.",
      "Around the globe, extreme weather due to climate change is forcing communities to move, whether it's powerful tropical storms in The Philippines and Honduras, drought in Somalia or forest fires in California.",
      "In the world's highest mountains, Samjung isn't the only community to have to start over, said Amina Maharjan, a migration specialist at ICMOD. Some villages move only short distances, but inevitably the key driver is lack of water.",
      "\"The water scarcity is getting chronic,\u201d she said.",
      "Retreating glaciers \u2014 rivers of ice shrinking back as the world warms \u2014 are the most tangible and direct evidence of climate change. Up to 80% of the glacier volume in the Hindu Kush and Himalayas could vanish in this century if greenhouse gas emissions aren\u2019t drastically cut, a 2023 report warned.",
      "It hasn't snowed in Upper Mustang for nearly three years, a dire blow for those living and farming in high-altitude villages. Snowfall traditionally sets the seasonal calendar, determining when crops of barley, buckwheat, and potatoes are planted and affecting the health of grazing livestock.",
      "\u201cIt is critically important,\" Maharjan said.",
      "For Samjung, the drought and mounting losses began around the turn of the century. Traditional mud homes built for a dry, cold mountain climate fell apart as monsoon rains grew more intense \u2014 a shift scientists link to climate change. The region's steep slopes and narrow valleys funnel water into flash floods that destroyed homes and farmland, triggering a wave of migration that began a decade ago.",
      "Moving a village \u2014 even one with fewer than 100 residents like Samjung \u2014 was no simple endeavor. They needed reliable access to water and nearby communities for support during disasters. Relocating closer to winding mountain roads would allow villagers to market their crops and benefit from growing tourism. Eventually, the king of Mustang, who still owns large tracts of land in the area nearly two decades after Nepal abolished its monarchy, provided suitable land for a new village.",
      "Pemba Gurung, 18, and her sister Toshi Lama Gurung, 22, don\u2019t remember much about the move from their old village. But they remember how hard it was to start over. Families spent years gathering materials to build new mud homes with bright tin roofs on the banks of the glacial Kali Gandaki river, nearly 15 kilometers (9 miles) away. They constructed shelters for livestock and canals to bring water to their homes. Only then could they move.",
      "Some villagers still herd sheep and yak, but life is a bit different in New Samjung, which is close to Lo Manthang, a medieval walled city cut off from the world until 1992, when foreigners were first allowed to visit. It's a hub for pilgrims and tourists who want to trek in the high mountains and explore its ancient Buddhist culture, so some villagers work in tourism.",
      "The sisters Pemba and Toshi are grateful not to have to spend hours fetching water every day. But they miss their old home.",
      "\u201cIt is the place of our origin. We wish to go back. But I don\u2019t think it will ever be possible,\u201d said Toshi.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- The fate of Argentina\u2019s state-run oil company was thrown into doubt Monday as a U.S. judge ordered the cash-strapped country to give up its 51% controlling stake in YPF in partial compensation for seizing the shares of former investors during its 2012 nationalization of the energy group.",
      "The ruling \u2014 a dramatic effort to enforce a $16 billion U.S. court judgement against Argentina \u2014 presents a new headache for libertarian President Javier Milei, the ideological foil for left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner who oversaw Argentina's contentious takeover of YPF and ensuing legal battles during her tenure (2007-2015). Milei vowed to appeal the ruling.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez's abrupt move to seize control of YPF at the time helped bring serial defaulter Argentina further infamy for abandoning its global financial obligations. Milei inherited an economy in shambles after decades of reckless state spending and campaigned on pledges to privatize state companies.",
      "In granting the request of former shareholders largely represented by Burford Capital, which finances litigation in return for a share of the winnings, Judge Loretta Preska of the Southern District of New York gave Argentina two weeks to transfer its shares in YPF to Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the major U.S. custody bank, according to the ruling seen by The Associated Press.",
      "Because YPF is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the plaintiffs could file the lawsuit in a U.S. district court. Shares of YPF closed down 5.6%.",
      "The judgement stems from a long-running legal case that in 2023 saw Judge Preska find Argentina liable for $16.1 billion in damages and interest. The plaintiffs argue that the government should have launched a tender offer for stakes held by minority shareholders.",
      "Milei, whose government has struggled to build up depleted foreign reserves, has vowed to appeal the ruling \u201cto defend national interests\" and blamed the problem on his political rivals.",
      "\u201cMore than 10 years have passed, and we Argentines continue to suffer the consequences of the worst government in Argentine history,\u201d he wrote on social media platform X.",
      "Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, Director for the Americas at the New York-based Horizon Engage risk consultancy, said the ruling was \u201ca reminder for the Milei administration that the country\u2019s problems will not go away just because he blames the opposition for them.\u201d",
      "\u201cControl of YPF is important for Milei; that\u2019s why an appeal is the only option for him,\u201d he added.",
      "Paying up and losing the controlling stake in YPF \u2014 which has become a pillar of the economy \u2014 would cripple Argentina at a crucial moment for Milei's government.",
      "YPF has accelerated its drive to develop the country's huge reserves of shale gas in the Vaca Muerta field in Argentine Patagonia. Crude production at Vaca Muerta has steadily climbed, hitting record production in May at 448,000 barrels per day, 22.5% more than the same month in 2024, according to official data.",
      "In 2024, YPF notched a net profit of almost $2.4 billion, up from a $1.3 billion loss the year before.",
      "Milei has hoped to leverage investments in the Vaca Muerta field to cure the nation's long-standing fiscal weakness and pay its massive deficits.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans are inching closer to getting their tax and spending cut bill through Congress with a final Senate vote likely late Monday or early Tuesday.",
      "At some 940 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. President Donald Trump has admonished Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.",
      "Democrats are united against the legislation and were offering scores of amendments to alter it Monday as the Senate slogged through what is known as a vote-a-rama. Senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments, with each receiving a vote. Once the bill clears the Senate, it would have to pass the House before Trump can sign it into law.",
      "Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as GOP lawmakers continue to negotiate.",
      "Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay, the ability to deduct interest payments for some automotive loans, along with a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.",
      "It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.",
      "A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.",
      "There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.",
      "The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.",
      "Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.",
      "The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.",
      "The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions.",
      "To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.",
      "For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.",
      "To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for the poor.",
      "Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program\u2019s work requirements.",
      "There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.",
      "More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.",
      "The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.",
      "Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden's 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering healthcare costs.",

      "Under the bill, a tax credit that subsidizes the production of electricity would be eliminated for any wind and solar plant not plugged into the grid by the end of 2027. But Republicans aren't just looking to roll back the tax breaks Biden put into place: they're also looking to add a tax for new wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.",
      "A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.",
      "Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.",

One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.",
      "Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The head of the European Central Bank said inflation has become more unpredictable due to shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and that policymakers need to take the possibility of such extreme scenarios into account and communicate them to the public as well.",
      "\u201cThe world ahead is more uncertain, and that uncertainty is likely to make inflation more volatile,\u201d ECB President Christine Lagarde said Monday in a speech opening the central bank's annual conference in Sintra, Portugal. \u201cIt's pretty basic but that's the reality.\u201d",
      "One reason, she said, was that increasingly regular supply disruptions were leading companies to change their prices more frequently, a habit that goes beyond the recent burst of inflation in the U.S. and Europe and \u201creflects a structural shift in how firms operate under conditions of permanently higher uncertainty.\"",
      "The bank's assessment of the economy needs to rely on taking extreme possible scenarios into account as well as the more likely baseline predictions, and it should let the public in on those possible outcomes as well, she said. Lagarde in particular cited the inflation spike that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where a baseline scenario based on higher energy prices suggest inflation for 2022 of 5.5% - but a worst-case scenario indicated more than 7% inflation, much closer to the final figure of 8%.",
      "Another example was the pandemic, where spending by homebound consumers shifted from services like restaurants to goods such as home exercise equipment.",
      "\u201cScenario analysis could have helped in illustrating that the range of possible inflation outcomes was unusually wide \u2013 and would have reduced the risk of projecting false certainty to the public,\u201d Lagarde said.",
      "The bank's strategy review announced Monday reaffirmed its target of 2% for inflation, a goal it has met for the time being as annual price increases were 1.9% in May. The drop in inflation has let the bank cut its benchmark interest rate from a peak of 4% to 2%.",
      "Threats of higher tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have added to uncertainty about the outlook for growth and inflation. The European Commission and US negotiators are trying to reach agreement on a trade deal ahead of a July 9 deadline.",
      "The conference in Sintra is the ECB's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and gathers top central bankers and economists from around the world. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is to take part in a panel on Tuesday with Lagarde, Bank of England Government Andrew Bailey, Bank of Korea Governor Chang Yong Rhee and Kazuo Ueda, the governor of the Bank of Japan.",

      "IV therapy clinics are springing up around the country, touting quick ways to recover from a hangover or a hard workout. But doctors and regulators preach caution.",
      "The services have been on a growth spurt since the COVID-19 pandemic, offering drips that promise to boost energy, gird immune systems or relieve joint pain. This is done from bags of intravenous fluids normally seen hanging next to hospital beds.",
      "Customers must be willing to fork over as much as couple hundred dollars for each session \u2014 in some cases for a mixture of vitamins and supplements that would be considerably cheaper in pill form.",
      "Proponents say this approach helps customers hydrate faster and absorb more of a vitamin or supplement than they would by swallowing pills.",
      "But Dr. Sam Torbati, co-chair of emergency medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, says the therapy mostly helps people create \u201cexpensive urine,\u201d with the body clearing what it doesn't use.",
      "They\u2019re hard to count, partly because some businesses just provide IV therapy while others offer it as part of a medical spa.",
      "The practice grew popular during COVID-19, when access to doctors became limited and people grew more concerned about their immune system health, according to the American IV Association, an industry group.",
      "Regulators in Ohio are following the trend closely in their state, which now has around 200 clinics. These businesses were largely unheard of there before the pandemic, said Cameron McNamee, a spokesman for the Ohio Board of Pharmacy.",
      "Doctors say there are some good questions to pose before any treatment starts.",
      "Customers should ask the person starting the IV how long they have been doing their job and what sort of training they have, said Torbati.",
      "They also should know what\u2019s in the IV drip. For instance, \u201cWonder Juice\u201d treatment offered by the Restore Hyper Wellness franchise combines six vitamins and supplements that are available, in oral form, on the pharmacy store shelves.",
      "Knowing all the ingredients comes in handy if someone has an allergic reaction.",
      "Also ask where the company gets its drugs, if any are used. The answer should be a licensed pharmaceutical wholesaler, according to McNamee.",
      "Otherwise, the drug could be counterfeit or substandard. Ohio regulators have suspended the licenses of businesses that purchased drugs on Facebook.",
      "Customers also should make sure the clinic is in decent shape when they visit.",
      "\u201cIf the office isn\u2019t clean, then the IV room\u2019s probably not clean either,\u201d McNamee said.",
      "They don\u2019t like that a nurse or a paramedic often helps a customer decide on an IV therapy and then delivers the treatment. Rules can vary, but many state regulators say a doctor, physician assistant or nurse practitioner should be involved.",
      "The clinics often run on standing orders, which are issued by a doctor with the idea that they give the nurse or paramedic permission to treat patients according to certain protocols.",
      "Hospital emergency rooms regularly operate on the same kind of orders, according to Dr. Chris Seitz, an emergency physician and chairman of the American IV Association's scientific advisory board.",
      "\u201cMany nurses saw patients before I ever could get to them in the emergency department and initiated care like IV fluids,\u201d he said.",
      "Regulators also worry about the role customers play in picking their own treatments.",
      "\u201cA patient cannot enter a doctor\u2019s office or hospital and demand an IV any more than a patient can direct his or her own appendectomy,\u201d Kentucky officials said in a March statement.",
      "But Seitz says there should be a partnership between any care provider and the patient, with the provider helping the patient make the right decision.",
      "\u201cPatients have a requirement and a need to be the CEO of their own health,\u201d he said.",
      "Patient choice feeds another worry: the mixing of ingredients for specific treatments, a practice known as compounding.",
      "South Carolina regulators said in a 2023 statement that this should result from a valid care provider order, \u201cnot from a patient-driven menu akin to a fast-food restaurant.\u201d",
      "However, proponents say the addition of vitamins or drugs to an IV treatment should not be confused with mixing prescription drugs in a lab.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just pretty simple low-hanging fruit in terms of clinical complexity,\u201d said Jeff Cohen, a co-founder of the American IV Association.",
      "IV therapy clinics do provide some care. They can help cancer patients or pregnant women stay hydrated. Some treatments offer relief from migraine pain.",
      "But many drips require the creation of a sterile, soluble vitamin or supplement that is safe to put into someone's veins. That's more expensive to make than a vitamin that may cost a few cents a pill, Torbati noted.",
      "Customers will need to determine whether the added expense is worth it.",

    "story": [
      "A Republican plan heading to a vote in the Senate would quickly end incentives for clean energy and impose new taxes on some wind and solar projects, while boosting production of coal used to make steel",
      "WASHINGTON -- Clean energy advocates were already bracing for a Republican-led bill that would phase out tax credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy as President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under former President Joe Biden.",
      "But a proposal that emerged over the weekend was even more drastic than they thought.",
      "It was more aggressive in ending incentives for clean energy than a previous Senate version and would even impose new taxes on some wind and solar projects while boosting production of coal used in steelmaking. The Senate was moving Monday to approve Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts even as Democrats lined up to challenge it.",
      "The GOP plan is \u201ca death sentence for America\u2019s wind and solar industries\u201d that will lead to a spike in Americans\u2019 utility bills and jeopardize hundreds of renewable energy projects slated to boost the nation's electric grid, said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "\u201cTheir plan started out as a phase-down of the tax credits I wrote for wind and solar\u201d in the 2022 climate law, Wyden said. \u201cBut now they\u2019re proposing an outright massacre with punishing new taxes on these industries that happen to be the cheapest and easiest ways to get new energy on the grid.\"",
      "Republicans said the tax-cut bill represents historic savings for taxpayers and supports production of traditional fossil-fuel energy sources such as oil, natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.",
      "\u201cTo achieve this record level of savings, we are slashing Biden\u2019s Green New Deal spending and promoting America-First energy,'' Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo, chairman of the Senate Finance panel and a lead architect of the bill, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe stop penalizing fossil fuels in favor of unreliable and expensive green energy, and instead support consistent energy sources, making energy affordable again.\u201d Crapo said.",
      "The Senate bill eliminates \u201chundreds of billions of dollars of the Green New Deal subsidies, including ending wasteful credits like the EV tax credit,\u201d he added, referring to a Democratic measure included the climate law to provide incentives for electric vehicles that don't emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "Some moderate senators, such as Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, were seeking to strip the new tax on wind and solar and make other other changes, but it was unclear whether those proposals would advance.",
      "If approved unchanged, the measure will kill investment in renewable energy and jeopardize hundreds of gigawatts of new power supply that would otherwise help the U.S. meet rapidly rising electricity demand as data centers, artificial intelligence and other growing uses strain the power grid, environmental advocates said.",
      "The GOP plan would \"lock in higher household energy bills, kill American jobs ... and torch our future,'' said Mattea Mrkusic, who leads energy policy for the environmental group Evergreen Action.",
      "The bill would cut off climate law credits for projects that aren\u2019t \u201cplaced in service\u201d \u2014 that is, plugged into the grid \u2014 by the end of 2028. That timeline is more aggressive than previous proposals and virtually impossible for most projects to meet, advocates said.",
      "The legislation also blocks credits for companies using components from adversaries such as China and adds a new tax on wind and solar projects that don\u2019t follow certain supply chain rules.",
      "Princeton University Professor Jesse D. Jenkins said he was surprised at the Senate bill's speed in ending wind and solar incentives and shocked at the proposed tax credit for metallurgical coal, a highly polluting form of coal that is used in steel-making and often exported to countries like India and Brazil.",
      "\u201cThis bill kills the industries of the future while subsidizing the industries of the 19th century. It\u2019s insanity!\u201d Jenkins said in a post on social media.",
      "If passed as proposed, the bill lead to higher energy prices, fewer jobs, less investment in American energy production and less confidence in the American business environment, Jenkins said.",
      "Tom Pyle, president of the conservative American Energy Alliance, called the Senate bill a move in the right direction.",
      "\u201cIf, as supporters of the Inflation Reduction Act are complaining, repealing these subsidies will \u2018kill\u2019 their industry, then maybe it shouldn\u2019t exist in the first place,\" Pyle said, referring to the 2022 climate law.",
      "\u201cExtending green giveaways on the backs of American taxpayers is shortsighted and neglectful,\" Pyle said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Congress to deliver both energy reliability and the largest tax cut in history to President Trump and the American people.\u201d",
      "Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, called the Senate bill a \u201cmidnight dumping\u201d and said it would punish the fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. energy industry.",
      "\u201cIt is astounding that the Senate would intentionally raise prices on consumers rather than encouraging economic growth and addressing the affordability crisis facing American households,\" Grumet said. The bill would \u201cstrand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments\u201d and land hardest on rural communities that would benefit the most from clean energy investment, he said.",
      "Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, called the bill \u201ca direct attack on American energy, American workers and American consumers.\"",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: If this bill passes, Americans will pay the price \u2014 literally,\" Hopper said. \"Power bills will rise. Factory jobs will vanish. Families will be forced to spend more just to keep the lights on and their homes cool. All while we become more dependent on foreign energy and more vulnerable to blackouts.\u201d",

      "It also leaves intact a major set of sanctions passed by Congress targeting anyone doing business with or offering support to Syria\u2019s military, intelligence or other suspect institutions. While the Trump administration has passed temporary waivers on those sanctions, known as the Caesar Act, they can only be permanently repealed by law.",
      "The White House posted the text of the order on X after the signing, which was not open to the press.",
      "The U.S. granted Syria sweeping exemptions from sanctions in May, which was a first step toward fulfilling the Republican president\u2019s pledge to lift a half-century of penalties on a country shattered by 13 years of civil war.",
      "Along with the lifting of economic sanctions, Monday\u2019s executive order lifts the national emergency outlined in an executive order issued by former President George W.

      "The U.S. Supreme Court has decided to review whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's lawsuit seeking to shut down part of an aging pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac belongs in state or federal court",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The U.S. Supreme Court announced Monday it will review whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's lawsuit seeking to shut down a section of an aging pipeline beneath a Great Lakes channel belongs in state court.",
      "Nessel sued in state court in June 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows the Enbridge energy company to operate a 4.5-mile (6.4-kilometer) section of pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.",
      "She won a restraining order shutting down the pipeline from Ingham County Judge James Jamo in June 2020, although Enbridge was allowed to continue operations after meeting safety requirements.",
      "The company moved the lawsuit into federal court in 2021, arguing it affects U.S. and Canadian trade. But a three-judge panel from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to Jamo in June 2024, finding that Enbridge missed a 30-day deadline to change jurisdictions.",
      "On Monday, the Supreme Court did not explain its rationale for taking up the matter.",
      "Enbridge officials said in a statement that they were encouraged by the Supreme Court's choice, noting that exceptions to the 30-day deadline exist.",
      "Nessel spokesperson Kimberly Bush said the lawsuit belongs in a Michigan court. The attorney general's lawyers have argued that the case invokes the public trust doctrine, a concept in state law holding that natural resources belong to the public.",
      "The pipeline at issue, Line 5, has moved crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Concerns over the section beneath the straits rupturing and causing a catastrophic spill have been growing since 2017, when Enbridge engineers revealed they had known about gaps in the section\u2019s protective coating since 2014. A boat anchor damaged the section in 2018, intensifying fears of a spill.",
      "The Michigan Department of Natural Resources under Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer revoked the straits easement for Line 5 in 2020. Enbridge has filed a separate federal lawsuit challenging the revocation.",
      "The company is seeking permits to encase the section of pipeline beneath the straits in a protective tunnel. The Michigan Public Service Commission granted the relevant permits in 2023, but Enbridge still needs approval from from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.",
      "The pipeline is at the center of a legal dispute in Wisconsin as well. A federal judge in Madison last summer gave Enbridge three years to shut down part of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior\u2019s reservation. The company has proposed rerouting the pipeline around the reservation and has appealed the shutdown order to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- A hard-right lawmaker was sworn in Monday as Greece\u2019s migration minister, replacing a fellow right-wing political heavyweight who resigned following accusations of involvement in the distribution of European Union farm subsidies.",
      "Five high-ranking government officials, including the previous migration minister, Makis Voridis, three deputy ministers and a secretary general, resigned last Friday following allegations they were involved in a scheme to provide EU agriculture subsidies to undeserving recipients.",
      "The funds, which were handled by a government body known by its Greek acronym OPEKEPE, were allegedly given to numerous people who had made false declarations of owning or leasing non-existent pastures or livestock.",
      "Thanos Plevris, 48, succeeded Voridis and is expected to maintain Greece\u2019s hard line in migration policy. Both Plevris and Voridis joined the conservative New Democracy party in 2012, from the right-wing populist Popular Orthodox Rally, or LAOS, party.",
      "Voridis has denied any involvement in the alleged farm subsidy fraud and said he resigned in order to clear his name.",
      "The European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which has investigated the case, passed on a hefty file to the Greek Parliament last week that includes allegations of possible involvement of government ministers. Lawmakers enjoy immunity from prosecution in Greece that can only be lifted by parliamentary vote.",
      "On Sunday, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said his New Democracy party had failed to stamp out graft.",
      "\u201cSignificant reform efforts were made,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a social media post. \u201cBut let\u2019s be honest. We failed.\u201d",
      "He said anyone found to have received EU funds they were not entitled to would be ordered to return the money.",
      "\u201cOur many farmers and livestock breeders who toil and produce quality products, and all law-abiding citizens, will not tolerate scammers who claimed to have non-existent pastures and livestock, or those who enabled them to do so,\u201d Mitsotakis said.",

      "The Senate\u2019s long day of voting has churned into a long night as Republican leaders grasp for ways to shore up support for President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate's long day of voting churned into a long Monday night, with Republican leaders grasping for ways to shore up support for President Donald Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts while fending off proposed amendments from Democrats who oppose the package and are trying to defeat it.",
      "The outcome was not yet in sight. Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota acknowledged the Republicans are \u201cfiguring out how to get to the end game.\u201d",
      "And House Speaker Mike Johnson signaled the potential problems the Senate package could face when it is eventually sent back to his chamber for a final round of voting, which was expected later this week, ahead of Trump's Fourth of July deadline.",
      "\u201cI have prevailed upon my Senate colleagues to please, please, please keep it as close to the House product as possible,\u201d said Johnson, the Louisiana Republican, as he left the Capitol around dinnertime. House Republicans had already passed their version last month.",
      "It's a pivotal moment for the Republicans, who have control of Congress and are racing to wrap up work with just days to go before Trump's holiday deadline Friday. The 940-page \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d as it\u2019s formally titled, has consumed Congress as its shared priority with the president.",
      "The GOP leaders have no room to spare, with narrow majorities in both chambers. Thune can lose no more than three Republican senators, and already two \u2014 Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who warns people will lose access to Medicaid health care, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who opposes raising the debt limit \u2014 have indicated opposition. Tillis abruptly announced over the weekend he would not seek reelection after Trump threatened to campaign against him.",
      "Attention quickly turned to key senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who have also raised concerns about health care cuts, but also a loose coalition of four conservative GOP senators pushing for even steeper reductions.",
      "And on social media, billionaire Elon Musk was again lashing out at Republicans as \u201cthe PORKY PIG PARTY!!\u201d for including a provision that would raise the nation\u2019s debt limit by $5 trillion, which is needed to allow continued borrowing to pay the bills.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said his side was working to show \u201chow awful this is.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are in shambles because they know the bill is so unpopular,\u201d Schumer said as he walked the halls. The Democrats have proposed dozens of amendments in what\u2019s called a vote-a-rama, though most were expected to fail.",
      "A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law. The CBO said the package would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the decade.",
      "The White House said it was counting on Republican lawmakers to \"get the job done.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans need to stay tough and unified during the home stretch,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Few Republicans appear fully satisfied as the final package emerges, in either the House or Senate.",
      "Tillis said it is a betrayal of the president's promises not to kick people off health care, especially if rural hospitals close.",
      "Collins has proposed bolstering the $25 billion proposed rural hospital fund to $50 billion, and Murkowski was trying to secure provisions to spare people in her state from some health care and food stamp cuts while also working to beef up federal reimbursements to Alaska's hospitals. They have not said how they would vote for the final package.",
      "At the same time, conservative Senate Republicans \u2014 Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming \u2014 have proposed steeper health care cuts and filed into Thune's office for a near-midnight meeting.",
      "As the first few Senate amendments came up Monday \u2014 to strike parts of the bill that would limit Medicaid funds to rural hospitals or shift the costs of food stamp benefits to the states \u2014 some were winning support from a few Republicans, though none passed.",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, the GOP chairman of the Finance Committee, dismissed the dire predictions of health care cuts as Democrats trafficking in what he called the \u201cpolitics of fear.\u201d",
      "All told, the Senate bill includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, according to the latest CBO analysis, making permanent Trump's 2017 rates, which would expire at the end of the year if Congress fails to act, while adding the new ones he campaigned on, including no taxes on tips.",
      "The Senate package would roll back billions of dollars in green energy tax credits, which Democrats warn will wipe out wind and solar investments nationwide. It would impose $1.2 trillion in cuts, largely to Medicaid and food stamps, by imposing work requirements on able-bodied people, including some parents and older Americans, making sign-up eligibility more stringent and changing federal reimbursements to states.",
      "Additionally, the bill would provide a $350 billion infusion for border and national security, including for deportations, some of it paid for with new fees charged to immigrants.",
      "Unable to stop the march toward passage, the Democrats as the minority party in Congress are using the tools at their disposal to delay and drag out the process.",
      "Democrats forced a full reading of the text, which took 16 hours, and they have a stream of amendments.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, raised particular concern at the start of debate late Sunday about the accounting method being used by the Republicans, which says the tax breaks from Trump's first term are now \u201ccurrent policy\u201d and the cost of extending them should not be counted toward deficits.",
      "She said that kind of \u201cmagic math\u201d won't fly with Americans trying to balance their own household books.",

      "\u201cYou want to listen to your players, too. Where do they want to play? Where are they going to get excited to play and draw fans? I do think that Miami would have been a great (location).

      "Clayton Kershaw is on the brink of a major milestone, needing just three strikeouts to reach 3,000 for his career",
      "It's a big number for one of the biggest baseball stars of this generation \u2014 three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw is closing in on 3,000 strikeouts.",
      "He needs just three more punchouts to reach the mark, meaning it likely will happen in front of an adoring home crowd at Dodger Stadium when Los Angeles hosts the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday night. Kershaw would become just the 20th pitcher in MLB history \u2014 and one of three active pitchers along with Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer \u2014 to hit the milestone.",
      "It's a time for celebration. It's also a time for wistful contemplation.",
      "Are we nearing the end of these kinds of career celebrations \u2014 particularly for pitchers?",
      "Kershaw is one of the final holdovers from his generation, one that included guys who threw at least 200 innings year after year, piling up wins and strikeouts thanks to consistent excellence. In his prime from 2010 to 2015, the 6-foot-4 lefty led the National League in ERA five times, in strikeouts three times and wins twice.",
      "His peak arguably came in 2014, when he finished with a 21-3 record, 1.77 ERA and 233 strikeouts to win both the Cy Young and Most Valuable Player in the National League.",
      "Kershaw, now 37, isn't the same pitcher these days, though his success over the past month is a testament to the knowledge, grit and sheer willpower that only an 18-year veteran can possess. He is 4-0 with a 3.03 ERA through eight starts since returning from injury, providing an injury-riddled Dodgers rotation with a spark despite a fastball that barely hits 90 mph on a good day.",
      "\u201cHe has given us a shot in the arm,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of ailing on the starting pitching side. Coming in and giving us valuable innings. I just love that kind of edge that he gives on start day.",
      "\u201cWe certainly feed off that.\u201d",
      "Kershaw's twilight is coinciding with the final years of Verlander and Scherzer, and the trio is primed to join the Hall of Fame over the next decade. The group symbolizes what might be the last gasp of long-term excellence on the pitcher's mound.",
      "The 42-year-old Verlander has won 262 career games while Kershaw and Scherzer \u2014 who turns 41 this month \u2014 both sit at 216. After that, the career leaderboards fall off dramatically.",
      "It's fair to wonder if any other MLB pitcher ever will reach 200 career wins again, much less 300, which was the gold standard for generations and last reached by the likes of Randy Johnson, Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux and Roger Clemens in the 2000s and 2010s.",
      "Consider this: The current career wins leader for a pitcher under 30 is the 28-year-old Logan Webb, who has a grand total of 62.",
      "Getting to 3,000 strikeouts is a little more realistic given the sport-wide increase in pitch velocity, but even that's in question. Atlanta's Chris Sale (2,528 Ks) is 36 and could get there with a few more healthy seasons. New York's Gerrit Cole (2,254) has a chance, too \u2014 if the 34-year-old can bounce back from elbow surgery.",
      "But again, the list of pitchers piling up strikeouts in their 20s is conspicuously absent.",
      "The 29-year-old Dylan Cease is the under-30 leader with 1,133 career Ks, but he likely will need a decade of good health to get close. By comparison, Kershaw had 2,120 strikeouts entering his age-30 season.",
      "There are some young, promising arms that might emerge in the future \u2014 think Paul Skenes and Tarik Skubal \u2014 but the trends aren't pointing in the right direction.",
      "It seems like every few days, anotherstarpitchergoesdown to Tommy John elbow surgery or a similar procedure, leaving them out of action for at least a year.",
      "Surely, career-altering injuries have been a part of baseball forever, but this feels different.",
      "To dominate in today's game, velocity is paramount. So is movement. The main goal is to make the baseball move as quickly and violently as possible, and today's pitchers are throwing nastier pitches than ever before. A big fastball used to be anything in the 90s just a few decades ago. Now, that number is closer to 100.",
      "The big problem is that most human arms don't seem to be able to handle the stress \u2014 particularly for the lengthy amounts of time needed to chase 300 wins, 3,000 strikeouts or many of the other career milestones that once defined greatness.",
      "Over the next generation, the metrics that determine which pitchers enter Cooperstown will likely change dramatically. Arizona righty Zac Gallen \u2014 who has 58 career wins and turns 30 in August \u2014 said last year that it's possible some pitchers from the current generation will be left out of the Hall of Fame as the definition of excellence changes.",
      "It should be a fascinating transition.",
      "But for at least one more night \u2014 probably Wednesday in Los Angeles in front of roughly 50,000 fans \u2014 Kershaw will carry the torch for traditional pitching greatness.",
      "Enjoy it, because that light appears to be fading fast.",

      "Jake Paul has entered the World Boxing Association\u2019s cruiserweight rankings",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Jake Paul has entered the World Boxing Association's cruiserweight rankings, making the YouTuber-turned-boxer eligible to fight for a world title.",
      "The WBA slotted Paul (12-1, 7 KOs) at No. 14 in the latest edition of its rankings late Monday night, two days after Paul beat 39-year-old Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. by unanimous decision in Anaheim, California.",
      "The WBA's decision to rank Paul likely means the sanctioning body would allow him to fight WBA cruiserweight champion Gilberto \u201cZurdo\u201d Ram\u00edrez, who won his latest title defense in the penultimate bout in Anaheim. The fighters have not agreed to a deal, but Paul and Ram\u00edrez stared each other down during the post-fight news conference.",
      "\u201cI want tougher fighters. I want to be a world champion,\u201d Paul said after outpointing Ch\u00e1vez, who had fought once in the previous four years. \u201cZurdo looked slow ... tonight. That'd be easy work, too.\u201d",
      "While Paul's ranking is a remarkable milestone for a social media behemoth and former Disney Channel star who only decided to become a boxer about six years ago, the WBA's decision reflects Paul's incredible financial potential more than his fighting resume.",
      "Sanctioning body rankings are determined internally, so they can be changed on a whim, or to meet an opportunity to collect a big fee by sanctioning a fight \u2014 and Paul has uniquely become the most financially potent boxer to emerge in many years.",
      "Paul's previous opponents include fellow YouTubers, an NBA player, several mixed martial artists and 58-year-old Mike Tyson \u2014 not a path that would lead to world rankings and title shots for any fighter without Paul's fame and fortune.",
      "He took his only loss in 2023 against Tommy Fury \u2014 a relatively serious professional boxer, but nowhere near a title contender. Paul has called for a rematch, telling Fury to \u201cstop running from me.\u201d",
      "Ch\u00e1vez was by far the most accomplished actual boxer to share the ring with Paul, but the former WBC middleweight champion fought listlessly and tepidly for all but the final two rounds in front of a Southern California crowd desperately rooting on its Mexican hero.",
      "Paul reiterated Saturday night that he has been ordered by God to become a world champion, and he spoke of several accomplished veteran boxers as his potential next opponent.",
      "Ram\u00edrez (48-1, 30 KOs) would be Paul's first step up to world-class opposition. Zurdo is a former super middleweight champion and current cruiserweight powerhouse who beat Yuniel Dorticos by decision in Anaheim.",
      "Nakisa Bidarian, Paul's business partner, suggested Saturday night that Paul might be more likely to take a title shot against Badou Jack, the 41-year-old Swede who holds the WBC cruiserweight belt.",
      "\u201cThe biggest issue with that (Paul vs. Ram\u00edrez) fight is Zurdo didn\u2019t show himself to be at all a promoter in this process,\u201d Bidarian said. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we seeing more out of Zurdo? Why isn\u2019t he more engaged with the fans? Someone like Badou Jack is someone that we want to have a conversation with.\u201d",

      "Cuba was scheduled to play in the NORCECA Women\u2019s Final Four tournament in Manat\u00ed, Puerto Rico. The tournament includes the host nation, Mexico and Costa Rica and it awards ranking points toward qualification for the Volleyball Nations League.",
      "\u201cWe were focused on the competition because it\u2019s right there,\" said Dayana Mart\u00ednez, another player. \"Arriving at the embassy and being denied the visa affects us a lot because that competition gives us points to improve our ranking,\u201d",
      "The Cuban team's coach, Wilfredo Robinson, said the decision means his team is likely to miss out on the Nations League.",
      "\u201cThe competition grants points for each match and at the end it all adds up,\" Robinson said. \u201cIn September we have another tournament and if we get there needing to achieve 80 or 100 points we are not going to be able to do it.\u201d",
      "The United States added Cuba to a list of 12 countries with restrictions for entering the U.S. or its territories, effective from early June. It includes nationals from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Iran, Venezuela, and other nations.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Barbora Krejcikova needed a comeback to avoid becoming the second consecutive Wimbledon women\u2019s champion to lose in the first round a year later at the All England Club, eventually eliminating 56th-ranked Alexandra Eala of the Philippines 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 at Centre Court on Tuesday.",
      "From the start of the Open era in 1968 through 2023, only one reigning women\u2019s champ was defeated in the first round at Wimbledon: Steffi Graf in 1994.",
      "But it happened last year to Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic \u2014 whose title in 2023 made her the first unseeded woman to leave the All England Club with the singles trophy \u2014 and there were moments early Tuesday that it appeared it might happen again this year to the 17th-seeded Krejcikova, another Czech player and the French Open champion in 2021.",
      "Eala is a 20-year-old left-hander who was competing at a Grand Slam tournament for only the second time. She lost in the first round at Roland-Garros in May.",
      "Eala is the only woman representing the Philippines to compete in the main draw of Wimbledon in the Open era.",
      "She signed with an agent when she was just 13 and honed her tennis skills at the Rafael Nadal Academy, getting advice from the 22-time major title winner who retired at the end of last season.",
      "Eala was seeking what would have been her fourth top-20 victory of 2025. She grabbed attention at the Miami Open by getting past 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko, Australian Open champion Madison Keys and former No. 1 and five-time major champ Iga Swiatek en route to the semifinals.",
      "Last week, Eala again defeated Ostapenko at the grass-court Eastbourne Open along the way to reaching the final there.",
      "Krejcikova, who is 29, made it to the quarterfinals at Eastbourne before withdrawing from that tournament because of an issue with her right thigh.",
      "She started slowly Tuesday, making 19 unforced errors in the first set. But Krejcikova cleaned up her play and had a total of 18 the rest of the way, often leaning forward with a clenched fist and a yell to celebrate points that moved her closer to the win.",

      "MANCHESTER, England -- The great Saudi Arabian soccer experiment is on full show at the Club World Cup.",
      "The oil-rich kingdom, which is spending billions of dollars to become a major player in the world's most popular sport, scored a big win on the field Monday when Al Hilal beat Premier League giant Manchester City 4-3 to advance to the quarterfinals.",
      "It was a seismic result in soccer terms; possibly the biggest upset of the tournament and precisely the type of statement Saudi Arabia has wanted to make since embarking on a project that will ultimately see it stage the World Cup in 2034.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to show that Al Hilal has the talent, the power to be here,\u201d said defender Kalidou Koulibaly, who was among a slew of star players paid fortunes to leave Europe's top clubs for the Saudi Pro League in recent years.",
      "The biggest of them all was Cristiano Ronaldo, who completed one of the most stunning moves in soccer history when joining Al Nassr for a reported salary of up to $200 million a year in 2022. That deal prompted a spectacular recruitment drive by Saudi teams \u2014 backed by the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund \u2014 and in came superstars like Neymar and Karim Benzema, while audacious attempts were made to sign Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe.",
      "Confirmation that Saudi Arabia had won the right to host the World Cup came in December. On the field, the Club World Cup was the first chance for the country to make a global statement about the growth of its domestic game, which is largely unheralded outside of Asia.",
      "It is likely why Al Hilal \u2014 Saudi Arabia's most successful team \u2014 was so eager to make another marquee signing before the tournament began and tried, but failed, to lure Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "It pulled off a coup by hiring coach Simone Inzaghi. The Italian arrived after leading Inter Milan to a second Champions League final in three seasons and he is already making a mark with his new team after drawing 1-1 against Real Madrid in the group stage and then beating City.",
      "\u201cWe had to do something extraordinary because we knew how good Manchester City are, we knew we had to climb Mount Everest without oxygen, and we were great,\" Inzaghi said.",
      "The broader picture is what Al Hilal's run says about the standard of soccer in Saudi Arabia, which has been dismissed by some as a cash grab for players, who can earn far more than if they'd remained in Europe.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s see now if they will criticize us after these games,\" said midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who joined Al Hilal from Italian team Lazio. \u201cIt's not like how they are speaking about the league.\u201d",
      "Despite recruiting so many players from Europe's top clubs \u2014 including Champions League winners N'Golo Kante, Riyad Mahrez and Roberto Firmino \u2014 it is difficult to judge the quality of the Saudi League.",
      "To put Al Hilal's run into context: while it may have won a record 19 league titles and four Asian championships, it is not the Saudi Arabia's reigning national champion, having been beaten to the title by Benzema's Al-Ittihad last season.",
      "Another Saudi team, Al-Ahli, which counts former Liverpool forward Firmino and ex Manchester City winger Mahrez among its players, won the Asian Champions League this year.",
      "Ronaldo, meanwhile, is yet to win the title in three attempts with Al Nassr \u2014 pointing to the depth of strength in the league.",
      "Al Hilal's performances have also come despite releasing Brazil great Neymar in January and with leading scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic having played no part so far because of injury.",
      "The question now is how far Al Hilal can go.",
      "Next up is Brazil's Fluminense in the quarterfinals in Orlando on Friday.",
      "City's exit \u2014 along with Inter Milan's defeat to Fluminense \u2014 has opened up that side of the draw, which also features Palmeiras and Chelsea.",
      "On paper it looks like the favorable side of the draw, with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain on the other side. But the success of Brazilian teams has been another theme of the tournament and Al Hilal will have to beat at least one more if it is to advance to the final.",
      "Inzaghi, however, is used to overachieving. His two Champions League finals with Inter Milan came despite having an aging team and relying on savvy deals in the transfer market to pick up free agents and veteran players.",
      "Inter's victory against Barcelona in the semifinals of this year's competition was one of the all-time classic contests \u2014 winning 7-6 on aggregate.",
      "Al Hilal's impressive run has come after Inzaghi spent just one week training with the team before the tournament.",
      "Even if it is eliminated in the next round, a quarterfinals appearance would represent an outstanding campaign for a team that was not expected to compete for the title.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s growing influence on sport \u2014 which also includes LIV Golf, world championship boxing, F1 and the buyout of Premier League team Newcastle \u2014 will continue to raise accusations it is \u201csportswashing\u201d its reputation. Amnesty international called it \u201creckless\u201d to grant it the World Cup over concerns about the country\u2019s human rights record.",
      "But its investment in sport is undoubtedly paying off and Al Hilal's run is succeeding in raising the profile of its soccer league.",

    "summary": "The LPGA Tour has never had parity like this to start the year",
    "story": [
      "The LPGA Tour has never had parity like this to start the year",
      "The lingering question for the last three months on the LPGA Tour was when Nelly Korda finally would win this year.",
      "Now the question should be who's going to win next?",
      "The latest entrants into the 2025 winner's ledgers were Somi Lee and Jin Hee Im at the Dow Championship, the only official team event on the LPGA schedule. That made it 17 straight tournaments with different winners.",
      "The LPGA has not seen this level of parity \u2014 or maybe it's lack of dominance \u2014 in its 75-year history. The previous record to start a season was 15 different winners in 2017 and 1991.",
      "Perhaps even more telling was this amazing streak of different winners was assured long before the South Korean duo birdied the first playoff hole to beat out Lexi Thompson and Megan Khang. That's because no one from the top 16 teams on the leaderboard at the Dow Championship had won this year.",
      "And to think it was a year ago when Korda ran off five straight victories to tie an LPGA record and ended the season with seven wins and as the dominant figure in women's golf. It would be asking a lot for her to repeat that (Scottie Scheffler is nodding his head), though it's still somewhat surprising that Korda hasn't registered a win halfway through the season.",
      "\u201cIt's golf,\u201d Korda said going into the KPMG Women's PGA Championship two weeks ago, where she was on the fringe of contention until the wind blew her into reverse. \"Every year is just so different. Last year coming into this event, I had five wins. I think even Hannah Green had multiple wins under her belt, too.",
      "\u201cIt's just ... it's just golf,\u201d she said. \u201cYou kind of just have to ride the wave, and the competition is getting better and better every year. To win once, to win twice, it's really good.\u201d",
      "The competition certainly is more diverse.",
      "The top 10 players in the women's world ranking represent eight countries. The 17 tournaments this year have been won by players from eight countries \u2014 including South Korea with four wins, and three each for the United States, Sweden and the potentially emerging power of Japan.",
      "But the parity is best illustrated by comparisons to the other streaks of different winners.",
      "There have been five first-time winners on the LPGA (six including both Lee and Im from the Dow Championship), and only three winners came into this year with at least five career victories on the LPGA.",
      "When the 2017 season began with 15 different winners, all of them previously had won on the LPGA and eight of them already had at least five wins. In 1991, which also featured 15 different winners to start the year, there were two first-time winners \u2014 one of them was World Golf Hall of Fame member Meg Mallon \u2014 and nine of those players already had five-plus LPGA wins.",
      "\u201cI think winning out here is getting tougher and tougher,\u201d Carlota Ciganda said after winning the Meijer LPGA Classic, her first LPGA title in more than eight years. \u201cLots of really good players, especially lots of youngster. Also good Japanese and Korean and Asians, and even Americans. Like, I think it's not easy.\"",
      "It's either parity or it's simply cyclical, and these things have a way of working themselves out.",
      "The 2017 season ended with nine multiple winners, none with more than two victories. South Korean rookie Sung-hyun Park and So Yeon Ryu shared the points-based LPGA player of the year, the first time for a tie since the award began in 1966. Four players left the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship with a trophy of some variety.",
      "That was some serious parity.",
      "In 1991, Mallon went on to win two majors and tied with Pat Bradley with four wins apiece. Bradley swept all the big awards by leading the money list and the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average and winning LPGA player of the year.",
      "There still are 15 tournaments on the LPGA schedule this year. Two of them are majors, starting next week with the Evian Championship in France.",
      "Lee was asked what she would take away from her first LPGA win and replied, \u201cJust same feel and same thing. Should be this win and forget and then again try to win.\u201d",
      "The previous 16 winners surely were thinking along those lines.",
      "Instead, the LPGA has witnessed a record with 17 straight tournaments and now multiple winners to start a season. Stranger still is a glance at the races for LPGA player of the year.",
      "Mao Saigo, who won the first major at the Chevron Championship and tied for fourth in the U.S. Women's Open, has a five-point lead over Women's PGA champion Minjee Lee, who is three points clear of Jeeno Thitikul.",
      "Korda is at No. 11 and could move to No. 1 in the points race if she wins either the Evian Championship or the Women's British Open three weeks later.",
      "There's a lot of time left for the season to get some definition, and for Korda to reassert herself as the dominant player in women's golf. That's what Scheffler has done on the men's tour, running off three wins in four tournaments, including a major.",
      "For now, a victory by Korda or Green or Ruoning Yin at No. 4 in the world would only add to a level of diversity the LPGA has never seen.",

      "The new system puts Wimbledon in line with nearly ever other top-tier tennis event on all surfaces \u2014 although the French Open, played on red clay, remains an exception, sticking with judges \u2014 and Monday's debut seemed to be mostly seamless, as far as players were concerned.",
      "Indeed, Frances Tiafoe, an American seeded 12th, didn't even notice there were no line judges at his first-round victory.",
      "What he did notice, and chuckled about afterward, was when the chair umpire wasn't even paying all that much attention at one point, grabbing the phone on his stand to place a call and request that more towels be brought to the court on the hottest Day 1 in tournament history.",
      "\u201cIt takes him completely out of play,\u201d Tiafoe said about the on-court official, \u201cother than just calling the score and calling time violations.\u201d",
      "No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka liked that the All England Club's switch to electronic line-calling eliminated the need for her to question whether she should contest a ruling. From 2007 until last year, players were allowed to ask for a video replay to check whether a decision was correct.",
      "\u201cIf you have line umpires, you (are) always thinking, like, \u2018Should I challenge or shouldn\u2019t I?\u2019\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of doubt in your head.\u201d",
      "Cam Norrie was pleased that there no longer is a reason to get angry about what's perceived as a wrong decision, the way McEnroe \u2014 and plenty of others through the years \u2014 used to.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s good. You get on with it. There\u2019s no kind of getting mad at anyone for missing a call or saying something or moving during the point or something happening,\u201d said Norrie, a British player who won Monday. \u201dIt's pretty black-or-white with the calls. In, out, and you hear it. There\u2019s no mistake.\"",
      "Not everything is favorable in his view, though.",
      "The familiar scene of officials sitting or standing around the court \u201clooks cool,\u201d Norrie said. Plus, he noted the loss of work for some of the 275 line judges the tournament used in the past (80 were brought back as \u201cmatch assistants\u201d to help chair umpires from behind the scenes).",
      "\u201cThe decision we've made there, I suppose, is very much about the way in which Wimbledon has always balanced heritage and tradition with innovation and how we walk that line. We're always very conscious of that. ... For us, it was time to make that change,\" All England Club CEO Sally Bolton said. \"It's not a money-saving exercise. It\u2019s about evolving the tournament and making sure that we're providing the most effective possible line-calling.\u201d",
      "Frenchman Adrian Mannarino liked having what he called \u201ca machine\u201d involved Monday, saying: \"You cannot complain against the machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you feel like someone is judging the ball and ... is probably not seeing so well, and maybe not even concentrating, it\u2019s pretty annoying,\" Mannarino said. \u201cBut the fact that it\u2019s a robot calling the balls, there\u2019s nothing to complain about.\u201d",
      "He did caution that it wasn't always easy to figure out which recorded announcements were for his win at Court 5, because it's wedged amid other courts.",
      "Sometimes he thought an \u201cOut!\u201d call at an adjacent match was for his.",
      "\u201cIt can be a little tricky with this,\u201d Mannarino said, \u201cbut overall, I think it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Paige Bueckers will play in her first WNBA All-Star Game while Nneka Ogwumike has earned her 10th selection, the league announced Monday as it named the players who will join Caitlin Clark and Napheesa Collier as All-Star starters.",
      "Bueckers, who was the No. 1 overall draft pick by the Dallas Wings, will be the 10th rookie to start the game. It's the third straight season it's happened, with Clark getting a start last year and Aliyah Boston in 2013. Bueckers is ranked 11th in the league in scoring (18.4 points) and sixth in assists (5.8) to lead all rookies in both categories. She received the sixth most votes from the fans.",
      "Ogwumike, who stars for Seattle, is tied for the third-most All-Star appearances with Tamika Catchings and Brittney Griner. She trails only Sue Bird (13) and Diana Taurasi (11).",
      "Clark and Collier were named captains of the teams on Sunday for receiving the most fan votes. The pair will draft their teams by choosing among the other starters as well as the 12 reserves chosen by coaches. The reserves will be announced this weekend.",
      "New York's Breanna Stewart and Las Vegas' A'ja Wilson each earned a seventh All-Star nod and will be in the starting lineup. Other starters selected Monday by a combination of fan, media and player voting included guards Allisha Gray of Atlanta and Sabrina Ionescu of New York. The frontcourt also will feature Phoenix's Satou Sabally and Boston, Clark's Indiana teammate.",
      "The starters were selected from across the WNBA without regard to conference affiliation. Players and a media panel joined fans in selecting the starters. Fans voting accounted for 50%, while the player and media votes each accounted for 25%.",
      "Boston finished fewer than 1,400 votes behind Minnesota star Collier for second in the fan voting. While Clark finished first in the fan vote, she was ninth in the players' vote and third in the media voting for guards.",
      "Kelsey Mitchell of Indiana and Angel Reese of Chicago both just missed making the All-Star starters list, finishing fifth and seventh, respectively, at their positions.",
      "The game will be played in Indianapolis on July 19.",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Germ\u00e1n Cano scored on a header three minutes into the match, and Fluminense held on to upset Champions League finalist Inter Milan 2-0 to advance to the Club World Cup quarterfinals in front of a sparse crowd of 20,030 at Bank of America Stadium on Monday.",
      "The Brazilians move on to face the Manchester City-Al Hilal winner on Friday in Orlando, Florida.",

      "The match got heated at one point after a Fluminense player on the bench appeared to grab one of the balls on the sideline to prevent an Inter Milan advantage after a ball was kicked out of bounds. The Brazilian team received a yellow card, but not until after players exchanged shoves.",
      "Mart\u00ednez had a point-blank shot in the second half to tie the game, but the ball hit off the upright. He couldn\u2019t believe his bad luck and shook his head in disbelief.",

I told them \u2018I trust you.\u2019 I told them yesterday and I told them again today and I told them, \u2018I believe it.\u2019 The players adapted very well.\u201d",
      "Fluminense played more poised throughout the match and became the second Brazilian club team to reach the quarterfinals, joining Palmeiras.",

      "The Houston Rockets continued their offseason improvements by adding veteran forward Dorian Finney-Smith on a four-year, $53 million deal shortly after the NBA\u2019s free agency window officially opened",
      "Victor Wembanyama has another big man to help him out in San Antonio. The Houston Rockets continued their offseason overhaul. And Orlando and Atlanta made moves with eyes on contending this coming season as the NBA's free agency period got underway Monday.",
      "The Spurs lured center Luke Kornet away from Boston with a four-year, $41 million deal, a person with knowledge of the agreement told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team cannot announce the deal until the league's signing moratorium for most contracts is lifted on Sunday.",
      "Kornet was part of Boston's 2024 NBA title team and has shot 68% from the field in 205 games, mostly off the bench, over the last three regular seasons. He figures to add frontcourt depth to the Spurs, who are hoping to have Wembanyama \u2014 the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year and an All-Star this past season \u2014 back and ready to go after he was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in a shoulder back in February.",
      "The Rockets, meanwhile, added veteran forward Dorian Finney-Smith on a four-year, $53 million deal shortly after free agency opened. ESPN first reported the deal, and a person with knowledge of the agreement confirmed the terms to AP.",
      "Houston becomes Finney-Smith's fourth team after stints with Dallas, Brooklyn and the Los Angeles Lakers. He'll be added to a Rockets club that earlier this summer landed Kevin Durant in a blockbuster trade with Phoenix, though that deal cannot receive formal approval from the NBA until next week.",
      "Finney-Smith averaged 8.7 points and was a 41% shooter from 3-point range this past season.",
      "ESPN also reported that the Rockets' run on free agents continued with the addition of center Clint Capela, who spent the first six years of his career in Houston before playing for the last five seasons in Atlanta. Capela agreed to a three-year deal with the Rockets, ESPN said.",
      "Dallas, which needed some point guard help especially because the newly re-signed Kyrie Irving \u2014 rehabbing from an ACL tear \u2014 may not be ready to play until about midseason, agreed with D'Angelo Russell on a two-year contract worth nearly $13 million.",
      "Russell would be part of the backcourt depth on a club with an imposing front line that, if healthy, would include No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg, 10-time All-Star Anthony Davis and promising young center Dereck Lively II.",
      "Atlanta added Nickeil Alexander-Walker from Minnesota on what will be a four-year, $62 million deal following a completion of a sign-and-trade with the Timberwolves. Minnesota will get a draft pick, cash considerations and will create a trade exception once the deal is finalized, a person with knowledge of the move told AP.",
      "The Magic, meanwhile, added Tyus Jones on a one-year deal. He joins an Orlando roster that already landed Desmond Bane from Memphis in a trade, and the Magic \u2014 who played long stretches last season without Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs because of injuries \u2014 should be a legit East contender this season if healthy.",
      "It was a big night for the Jones family: Tyus Jones' brother, Tre Jones, agreed Monday on a three-year deal to return to the Chicago Bulls.",
      "The free agency period officially opened at 6 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, but in actuality, was rolling long before that.",
      "LeBron James has already opted in to a $52.6 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers for this coming season, the Rockets traded for Durant \u2014 not a free agency move, obviously \u2014 and the Los Angeles Clippers saw James Harden decline his option in return for a new deal and a raise. There was even a surprise addition to free agency, with Portland announcing it has bought out the contract of former No. 1 pick Deandre Ayton, allowing him to sign with any team he chooses.",
      "And on Monday, even before the shopping window officially started, more deals: Nicolas Batum will come back to the Clippers, his agency said, on a two-year deal, while Joe Ingles agreed to return to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Deals like those could get done before the official start time because teams are allowed to negotiate with their own free agents once the NBA Finals are finished.",

      "Martin Cooper changed the world when he pioneered the portable phone",
      "DEL MAR, Calif. -- Dick Tracy got an atom-powered two-way wrist radio in 1946. Marty Cooper never forgot it.",
      "The Chicago boy became a star engineer who ran Motorola\u2019s research and development arm when the hometown telecommunications titan was locked in a 1970s corporate battle to invent the portable phone. Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The simple landlines once used to call friends or family have evolved into omnipresent glossy screens that never leave our sight and flood our brain with hours of data daily, deluging us with endless messages, emails, videos and a soundtrack that many play constantly to block the outside world.",
      "From his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.",
      "Now, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.",
      "\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c",
      "Human behavior is already adapting to smartphones, some observers say, using them as tools that allow overwhelmed minds to focus on quality communication.",
      "The phone conversation has become the way to communicate the most intimate of social ties, says Claude Fischer, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of \u201cAmerica Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940.\u201d",
      "For almost everyone, the straight-up phone call has become an intrusion. Now everything needs to be preceded by a message. \u201cThere seems to be a sense that the phone call is for heart-to-heart and not just for information exchange,\u201d Fischer says.",
      "And this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d",
      "Child education student Katheryn Ruiz, 19, concurs, saying \u201ctexting is used for just like nothing substantial, like nothing personal.\u201d",
      "Sometimes the roles are reversed, though. Sixty-eight-year-old Diana Cunningham of Overbrook, Kansas, pop. 1005, uses a group text to stay in touch with her kids and grandkids. Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d",
      "When she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d",
      "Many worry about the changes exerted by our newly interconnected, highly stimulated world.",
      "We increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to the number of people who can be reaching out to you at the same time and it\u2019s just overwhelming,\u201d says Kristen Burks, an associate circuit judge in Macon, Missouri.",
      "Most importantly, sociologists, psychologists and teachers say, near-constant phone-driven screen time is cutting into kids\u2019 ability to learn and socialize. A growing movement is pushing back against cellphones\u2019 intrusion into children\u2019s daily lives.",
      "\u201cAt the turn of the millennium, technology companies based on the West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products,\u201d New York University social psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for a year.",
      "\u201cBy creating a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids\u2019 eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d he writes.",
      "Seven states have signed \u2014 and twenty states have introduced \u2014 statewide bell-to-bell phone bans in schools. Additional states have moved to prohibit them during teaching time.",
      "That doesn\u2019t sit well with the smartphone\u2019s inventor, who says there are better solutions than regulation. \u201cAccommodating disruptive technologies requires disruptive solutions,\u201d Cooper wrote from Del Mar. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for teachers to integrate the cellphone that provides access to all the information in the world?\u201d",
      "That advantage is coming to rich countries faster than poor ones.",
      "The first time that Nnaemeka Agbo had to leave his family in Nigeria for a prolonged period, life shuttled him to Russia for studies, like many other young Nigerians increasingly desperate to relocate to seek better opportunities.",
      "Adjusting to life in Russia when he moved there in 2023 was tough, he says, but one thing kept him going; WhatsApp calls with family. \u201cOne thing that kept me sane was calling home every time, and it made me feel closer to my people,\u201d the 31-year-old says.",
      "In a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest poverty and hunger levels despite being Africa\u2019s top oil producer, Agbo\u2019s experience mirrors many young people in Nigeria increasingly forced to choose between remaining at home with family or aiming at a better life elsewhere. At least 37% of African adults expressed their desire to live somewhere else in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a Gallup survey published in October last year.",
      "For many, phone calls blur the distance and offer comfort.",
      "\u201cNo matter how busy my schedule is, I must call my people every weekend, even if that\u2019s the only call I have to make,\u201d Agbo says.",
      "In Africa, where only 37% of the population had internet access in 2023, according to the International Telecommunication Union, regular mobile calls are the only option many have. In northern Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara state, Abdulmalik Saidu says the mobile connectivity rate is so low that \u201csometimes we stay for weeks without network.\u201d",
      "When 19-year-old Shamsu Deen-Cole flew from Sierra Leone to the United States to study international relations in 1971, making a call to his parents in Sierra Leone would take days, starting with telling his parents when to expect the call.

      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and drop them from airplanes over Mexico and even southern Texas",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally good technology,\u201d said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\u201d",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the New World Screwworm fly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them \u2014 so they can mate ineffectively with females and over time cause the population to die out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\u201cA thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\u201d said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\u201cIt smelled nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cLike rotting meat.\u201d",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly\u2019s cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University\u2019s Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \u201cWhiz Packer.\u201d",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA\u2019s \u201ccrowning achievements.\u201d",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn\u2019t be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\u201cSomething we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\u201d Burgess said.",

Maria Cantwell of Washington on Monday night to introduce an amendment to strike the entire proposal.

      "The 33\u2014page opinion from U.S. District Judge Xavier Neals in New Jersey will enable an antitrust lawsuit that the U.S. Justice Department filed against Apple 15 months ago to proceed. Neals has set a timetable that could see the case come to trial in 2027.",
      "Apple has sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing the Justice Department had distorted the contours of the smartphone market and made a series of other misinterpretations that warranted the case be thrown out.",
      "But Neals decided there is enough evidence to support the Justice Department's market definitions and concluded the case's key allegations merited further examination at trial.",
      "The case seeks to pierce the digital fortress that Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, has built around the iPhone, iPad and other products to create a so-called \u201cwalled garden\u201d allowing its hardware and software to mesh seamlessly for users.",
      "The Justice Department alleges that walled garden has mostly turned into a shield against competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices and stifle innovation.",
      "The lawsuit \u201csets forth several allegations of technological barricades that constitute anticompetitive conduct,\u201d Neals wrote in his opinion. The judge also concluded the Justice Department had pointed toward enough areas of troubling conduct that raised the \u201cdangerous possibility\u201d that Apple has turned the iPhone into an illegal monopoly.",
      "In a Monday statement, Apple reiterated its position that the Justice Department's case \u201cis wrong on the facts and the law, and we will continue to vigorously fight it in court.\u201d",
      "The antitrust lawsuit isn't the only legal headache threatening to undercut its profits, which totaled $94 billion on sales of $295 billion in its fiscal year ending last September.",

      "Apple also could lose a more than $20 billion annual payment that it gets for making Google the default search tool on the iPhone and other products as part of another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department. A federal judge in Washington D.C. is considering whether to ban the deals with Apple as part of a shake-up being proposed to address Google's illegal monopoly in searc h.",
      "Neals' decision to allow the Justice Department's antitrust case to proceed came on the same day that Apple was hit with a lawsuit by app maker Proton amplifying the accusations of wrongful conduct by the company. The lawsuit, which will seek to be certified as a class action presenting thousands of developers who have made iPhone apps, is asking for punitive damages against Apple, as well as a court order to dismantle its walled garden.",

      "Giving Funds is GoFundMe\u2019s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered",
      "NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall.",
      "Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived.",
      "\u201cIt was just a bit of a thing,\u201d he added. \"If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.\u201d",
      "Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers \u2014 products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts.",
      "To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they\u2019re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cThat connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.\u201d",
      "Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit.",
      "The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals.",
      "There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements.",
      "GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors.",
      "Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving \u2014 something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as \u201cwealth management products.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a giving product,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something for everybody. And you don\u2019t need to know the words \u2018donor advised fund.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d",
      "DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes \u2014 even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023.",
      "Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas.",
      "That \u201cdynamic, alive community\u201d is very different from the \u201cfairly static, passive\u201d financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially inspiring the money to move,\u201d he said.",
      "Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning.",
      "Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the \u201csweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.\u201d",
      "The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are \u201cavailable-to-everyone vehicles\" considering that half run balances under $50,000.",
      "\u201cGivers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.\u201d",
      "But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as \u201ca game changer\u201d that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years.",
      "Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a \u201csavings account\" for \"good works.\"",
      "\u201cAnd GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,\u201d she said.",

      "Four teams of humanoid robots faced off in fully autonomous 3-on-3 soccer matches powered entirely by artificial intelligence on Saturday night in China's capital in what was touted as a first in China and a preview for the upcoming World Humanoid Robot Games, set to take place in Beijing.",
      "According to the organizers, a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies without any human intervention or supervision.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with agility",
      "They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling. However, during the match several still had to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff, adding to the realism of the experience.",
      "China is stepping up efforts to develop AI-powered humanoid robots, using sports competitions like marathons, boxing, and football as a real-world proving ground.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offer the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots, helping to accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also emphasized safety as a core concern in the application of humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cFor example, a robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn\u2019t matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place. That would help audiences build trust and understand that robots are safe.\u201d",
      "Booster Robotics provided the hardware for all four university teams, while each school\u2019s research team developed and embedded their own algorithms for perception, decision-making, player formations, and passing strategies\u2014including variables such as speed, force, and direction, according to Cheng.",

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "In the time before widespread vaccination, young children often lost their lives to devastating infectious diseases that ran rampant in America",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- In the time before widespread vaccination, death often came early.",
      "Devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. These illnesses were the main reason why nearly one in five children in 1900 never made it to their fifth birthday.",
      "Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.",
      "\u201cThis concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines \u2013 because they eliminated the diseases,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with the disease, you don\u2019t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don\u2019t value the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves \u2014 and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.",
      "Some Americans know the reality of these preventable diseases all too well. For them, news of measles outbreaks and rising whooping cough cases brings back terrible memories of lives forever changed \u2013 and a longing to spare others from similar pain.",
      "With a mother\u2019s practiced, guiding hand, 80-year-old Janith Farnham helped steer her 60-year-old daughter\u2019s walker through a Sioux Falls art center. They stopped at a painting of a cow wearing a hat.",
      "Janith pointed to the hat, then to her daughter Jacque\u2019s Minnesota Twins cap. Jacque did the same.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so funny!\u201d Janith said, leaning in close to say the words in sign language too.",
      "Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause a host of issues including hearing impairment, eye problems, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted the viral illness very early in the pregnancy, when she had up to a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby with the syndrome.",
      "Janith recalled knowing \u201cthings weren\u2019t right\u201d almost immediately. The baby wouldn\u2019t respond to sounds or look at anything but lights. She didn\u2019t like to be held close. Her tiny heart sounded like it purred \u2013 evidence of a problem that required surgery at four months old.",
      "Janith did all she could to help Jacque thrive, sending her to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind and using skills she honed as a special education teacher. She and other parents of children with the syndrome shared insights in a support group.",
      "Meanwhile, the condition kept taking its toll. As a young adult, Jacque developed diabetes, glaucoma and autistic behaviors. Eventually, arthritis set in.",
      "Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home a short drive from Janith's place. Above her bed is a net overflowing with stuffed animals. On a headboard shelf are photo books Janith created, filled with memories like birthday parties and trips to Mount Rushmore.",
      "Jacque\u2019s days typically begin with an insulin shot and breakfast before she heads off to a day program. She gets together with her mom four or five days a week. They often hang out at Janith\u2019s townhome, where Jacque has another bedroom decorated with her own artwork and quilts Janith sewed for her. Jacque loves playing with Janith\u2019s dog, watching sports on television and looking up things on her iPad.",
      "Janith marvels at Jacque\u2019s sense of humor, gratefulness, curiosity and affectionate nature despite all she\u2019s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs \u201cdouble I love yous\u201d to family, friends and new people she meets.",
      "\u201cWhen you live through so much pain and so much difficulty and so much challenge, sometimes I think: Well, she doesn\u2019t know any different,\u201d Janith said.",
      "Given what her family has been through, Janith believes younger people are being selfish if they choose not to get their children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than frustrating. I mean, I get angry inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what can happen, and I just don\u2019t want anybody else to go through this.\u201d",
      "More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls getting home from work, opening the car door and hearing her mother scream. Inside the house, her little sister Karen lay unconscious on the bathroom floor.",
      "It was 1970, and Karen was 6. She\u2019d contracted measles shortly after Easter. While an early vaccine was available, it wasn\u2019t required for school in Miami where they lived. Karen\u2019s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, but their mother didn't share his sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cIt's not that she was against it,\" Tobin said. \"She just thought there was time.\u201d",
      "Then came a measles outbreak. Karen \u2013 who Tobin described as a \u201cvery endearing, sweet child\u201d who would walk around the house singing \u2013 quickly became very sick. The afternoon she collapsed in the bathroom, Tobin, then 19, called the ambulance. Karen never regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cShe immediately went into a coma and she died of encephalitis,\u201d said Tobin, who stayed at her bedside in the hospital. \u201cWe never did get to speak to her again.\u201d",
      "Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions allowed for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.",
      "The result? Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very upset by how cavalier people are being about the measles,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they realize how destructive this is.\u201d",
      "One of Lora Duguay\u2019s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.",
      "\u201cI could only see my parents through a glass window. They were crying and I was screaming my head off,\u201d said Duguay, 68. \u201cThey told my parents I would never walk or move again.\u201d",
      "It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Florida, had polio. It mostly preyed on children and was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.",
      "Given polio's visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80% to 90% effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.",
      "Duguay initially defied her doctors. After intensive treatment and physical therapy, she walked and even ran \u2013 albeit with a limp. She got married, raised a son and worked as a medical transcriptionist.",
      "But in her early 40s, she noticed she couldn\u2019t walk as far as she used to. A doctor confirmed she was in the early stages of post-polio syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder that worsens over time.",
      "One morning, she tried to stand up and couldn\u2019t move her left leg.",
      "After two weeks in a rehab facility, she started painting to stay busy. Eventually, she joined arts organizations and began showing and selling her work. Art \"gives me a sense of purpose,\u201d she said.",
      "These days, she can't hold up her arms long enough to create big oil paintings at an easel. So she pulls her wheelchair up to an electric desk to paint on smaller surfaces like stones and petrified wood.",
      "The disease that changed her life twice is no longer a problem in the U.S. So many children get the vaccine \u2014 which is far more effective than earlier versions \u2014 that it doesn't just protect individuals but it prevents occasional cases that arrive in the U.S. from spreading further. \u201c Herd immunity \" keeps everyone safe by preventing outbreaks that can sicken the vulnerable.",
      "Every night, Katie Van Tornhout rubs a plaster cast of a tiny foot, a vestige of the daughter she lost to whooping cough at just 37 days old.",
      "Callie Grace was born on Christmas Eve 2009 after Van Tornhout and her husband tried five years for a baby. She was six weeks early but healthy.",
      "\u201cShe loved to have her feet rubbed,\" said the 40-year-old Lakeville, Indiana mom. \"She was this perfect baby.\u201d",
      "When Callie turned a month old, she began to cough, prompting a visit to the doctor, who didn\u2019t suspect anything serious. By the following night, Callie was doing worse. They went back.",
      "In the waiting room, she became blue and limp in Van Tornhout\u2019s arms. The medical team whisked her away and beat lightly on her back. She took a deep breath and giggled.",
      "Though the giggle was reassuring, the Van Tornhouts went to the ER, where Callie\u2019s skin turned blue again. For a while, medical treatment helped. But at one point she started squirming, and medical staff frantically tried to save her.",
      "\u201cWithin minutes,\u201d Van Tornhout said, \u201cshe was gone.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout recalled sitting with her husband and their lifeless baby for four hours, \"just talking to her, thinking about what could have been.\u201d",
      "Callie\u2019s viewing was held on her original due date \u2013 the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called to confirm she had pertussis, or whooping cough. She was too young for the Tdap vaccine against it and was exposed to someone who hadn\u2019t gotten their booster shot.",
      "Today, next to the cast of Callie\u2019s foot is an urn with her ashes and a glass curio cabinet filled with mementos like baby shoes.",
      "\u201cMy kids to this day will still look up and say, \u2018Hey Callie, how are you?\u2019\u201d said Van Tornhout, who has four children and a stepson. \u201cShe\u2019s part of all of us every day.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout now advocates for childhood immunization through the nonprofit Vaccinate Your Family. She also shares her story with people she meets, like a pregnant customer who came into the restaurant her family ran saying she didn\u2019t want to immunize her baby. She later returned with her vaccinated four-month-old.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to us as adults to protect our children \u2013 like, that\u2019s what a parent\u2019s job is,\u201d Van Tornhout said. \u201cI watched my daughter die from something that was preventable \u2026 You don\u2019t want to walk in my shoes.\u201d",

      "Ticks can be active in any season and experts say it\u2019s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ticks can be active in any season and it's important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible \u2014 especially after you've been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.",
      "\u201cHumans are outside more in summer so we hear about more tick infections,\u201d said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he urges caution year-round because \u201cevery season is tick season.\u201d",
      "While tick populations vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing \u201cabove average\u201d numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.",
      "And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.",
      "Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders \u2013 with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.",
      "There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.",
      "A tick bite doesn't always lead to illness. \u201cIf you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,\u201d said Telford.",
      "Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.",
      "Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,\u201d said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWhen you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you\u2019re also more likely to spot any other ticks.\"",
      "Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don\u2019t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.",

      "Apple has moved to revamp its European Union app store policies as it seeks to fend off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc\u2019s digital competition regulations",
      "LONDON -- Apple has revamped its app store policies in the European Union with hopes of fending off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc's digital competition regulations.",
      "It's a last-minute bid by the iPhone maker to avoid further charges following a 500 million euro ($585 million) penalty in April. The bloc's executive Commission punished Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, and gave it a 60-day deadline, which expired Thursday, to avoid additional, periodic fines.",
      "The changes made by Apple will make it easier for app makers to point users to better deals on digital products and options to pay for them outside of Apple's own App Store, including other websites, apps or alternative app stores.",
      "The California company is also rolling out a two-tier system of fees to accommodate app developers that want to use alternative payments.",
      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",
      "The commission noted Apple\u2019s announcement and \u201cwill now assess these new business terms for DMA compliance,\u201d referring to the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act. The rulebook was designed to rein in the power of big tech companies under threat of hefty fines worth up to 10% of a company's global annual revenue.",
      "Among the DMA\u2019s provisions are requirements that developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options, and direct them to those offers.",
      "Apple's restrictions preventing developers from steering users to outside payment channels had been fiercely opposed by some companies. It's the reason, for example, Spotify removed the in-app payment option to avoid having to pay a commission of up to 30% on digital subscriptions bought through iOS.",

      "The jury in the Combs trial began deliberations on Monday.",
      "The jury in the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs trial completed their second day of deliberations on Tuesday, weighing a verdict that could not only put the rapper and business mogul in prison but also strip Combs of a sizable share of his wealth.",
      "The jury in Manhattan federal court is debating whether Combs is guilty of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution, all of which Combs has denied.",
      "Combs\u2019 vast portfolio features multi-million-dollar mansions in Los Angeles and Miami, a private jet, high-priced art and private investments, among other holdings, including his Bad Boy Entertainment business assets, which include his Bad Boy Records label.",
      "Last year, before Combs was indicted but after his Los Angeles and Miami homes were raided by federal agents and the video of him physically assaulting former girlfriend Cassie Ventura came to light, Forbes estimated Combs\u2019 net worth at $400 million, which marked a sharp decline from the outlet\u2019s estimate in 2019 of $740 million.",
      "The federal government could seize some of Combs\u2019 assets if he\u2019s found guilty and a conviction would increase the likelihood of success for potential civil suits, some experts told ABC News. If Combs is acquitted, they added, he likely would risk losing some income due to the stigma attached to information that was disclosed at trial.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about how the Combs trial could impact his wealth, according to legal experts who spoke with ABC News.",
      "When federal prosecutors unsealed their indictment against Combs in September, the allegations called for the forfeiture of Combs\u2019 assets in the event of a conviction. Referencing a charge of racketeering conspiracy against Combs, for instance, prosecutors said they would seek all assets \u201cacquired or maintained\u201d in violation of the law.",
      "An attempt to seize assets is fairly common when prosecuting racketeering conspiracy charges, also known as RICO cases, Kenworthey Bilz, a law professor at the University of Illinois, told ABC News.",
      "If prosecutors proved that Combs\u2019 private jet was used to transport sex workers or clients, for example, the asset could be seized, Bilz said. Assets unrelated to the alleged crime, however, couldn't be touched.",
      "\u201cThe government would have to prove that assets were used to further the enterprise,\u201d Bilz said.",
      "In the event of a conviction, Combs\u2019 punishment could also include financial penalties and a requirement that he pay restitution to some victims, Nikos Passas, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Northeastern University, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cWhenever you have a very wealthy person convicted of this sort of crime, you\u2019re going to have huge implications,\u201d Passas said. \u201cThere\u2019s serious damage that he\u2019s done and he has the deep pockets to cover it.\u201d",
      "Combs could also face additional payouts as result of potential civil lawsuits, which would prove more likely to succeed after a criminal conviction, the experts said.",
      "In criminal cases, prosecutors must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In civil suits, however, prosecuting attorneys need only establish a preponderance of evidence, meaning they must show it\u2019s more likely than not that a defendant committed the offense.",
      "\u201cA criminal conviction on some or all charges would certainly bolster civil claims against Diddy,\u201d Clark Neily, senior vice president for legal studies at the Cato Institute and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, told ABC News.",
      "If acquitted, Combs will avoid the immediate financial penalties that would otherwise arise from the criminal case, as spelled out in the indictment, but he would remain exposed to potential civil lawsuits as well as possible lost income due to his damaged reputation, the experts told ABC News.",
      "\u201cFor a high-profile artist and performer like Diddy, reputation is currency,\u201d Jeff Apruzzese, professor of the music industry at Drexel University, told ABC News. \u201cFor him, right now, that currency is devaluing pretty fast.\u201d",
      "Combs could face greater challenges booking venues and establishing endorsements or corporate partnerships, Apruzzese said. Even more, Apruzzese added, Combs will face difficulty garnering invites to award shows and signing new artists to record deals, limiting his alternate pathways to income.",
      "In 2021, singer R. Kelly \u2013 whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly \u2013 was convicted on nine counts, including racketeering charges tied to the sexual exploitation of children and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.",
      "While Kelly was found guilty, the outcome serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of preserving one\u2019s reputation in the music industry, Apruzzese said, adding that \u201cR. Kelly\u2019s revenue pretty much dried up completely after everything that happened.\"",
      "David B. Allan, a professor of music marketing at St. Joseph\u2019s University, said many fans may turn away from Combs regardless of the verdict \u2013 and they\u2019ll take their spending power with them.",
      "\u201cI think the jury of public opinion has already decided, and they to a large extent feel like he\u2019s guilty of something that they don\u2019t approve of,\u201d Allan said.",

      "\u201cThe eight victims who lost their lives did nothing to deserve what the MS-13 did to them,\u201d they wrote in legal filings ahead of Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cThe defendant and the others killed them in service of the gang without remorse or any regard for them as human beings.\u201d",

      "Susan Collins",
      "One of the mostly closely watched as the vote neared was Collins, who had been on the fence due to the bill's proposed Medicaid cuts.",
      "\"Approximately 400,000 Mainers \u2013 nearly a third of the state's population \u2013 depend on this program,\" she said in a statement after voting no. \"A dramatic reduction in future Medicaid funding, an estimated $5.9 billion in Maine over the next 10 years, could threaten not only Mainers' access to health care, but also the very existence of several of our state's rural hospitals.\"",
      "Collins added that the bill had \"additional problems.\"",
      "\"The tax credits that energy entrepreneurs have relied on should have been gradually phased out so as not to waste the work that has already been put into these innovative new projects and prevent them from being completed,\" she said.",
      "GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted in favor of the bill despite reservations.",

      "\"I struggled mightily with the [bill's] impact on the most vulnerable in this country,\" she told reporters.",

      "Tillis has been extremely vocal in his opposition since the weekend, drawing attention for a passionate floor speech citing Medicaid provisions he claimed would hurt his North Carolina constituents.",
      "During a closed-door GOP conference meeting two weeks ago, Tillis is reported to have made the point that Medicaid coverage for more than 600,000 North Carolinians would be at risk under the Senate's proposal and asked his colleagues to consider how the policy would affect their own states -- even providing state-specific data on a handout.",
      "\"I just encouraged other members to go to their states and just measure how ... take a look at the proposed cuts and tell me whether or not you can absorb it in the normal course of business, and in many cases, you're gonna find that you can't,\" Tillis told reporters at the Capitol last week.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a post on Substack on Tuesday that USAID -- which oversaw foreign aid, disaster relief and international development programs -- would no longer be providing assistance to other countries.",
      "\"As of July 1st, USAID will officially cease to implement foreign assistance,\" Rubio wrote. \"Foreign assistance programs that align with administration policies -- and which advance American interests -- will be administered by the State Department, where they will be delivered with more accountability, strategy, and efficiency.\"",

      "Obama calling the dismantling of USAID a tragedy and a \"colossal mistake,\" according to The Associated Press, which reviewed portions of the video. Bush focused on PEPFAR -- the global health initiative launched under his administration to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic -- which is credited for saving 25 million lives, the AP reported.",
      "Humanitarian aid organizations said they have been witnessing the effects of USAID cuts, with programs shutting down that helped communities experiencing poverty and conflict.",
      "\"It's an extremely sad day,\" Bob Kitchen, vice president of emergency and humanitarian action with the International Rescue Committee (IRC), told ABC News. \"I had the pleasure of working with hundreds of committed USAID staff around the world over the last couple of decades. They've done amazing work and funded amazing projects, and it's sad to see like that'll come predominantly to an end.\"",
      "Kitchen said IRC has lost several of its grants and that 40% of its funding came from USAID. As a result, he said several IRC programs are now closed or will soon close, including water and sanitation programs, mobile health clinics and school programs.",
      "\"What that looks like \u2026 is many thousands of girls who no longer can go to any form of school [In Afghanistan] as a result of the closure of this program,\" Kitchen said. \"The one that really hits me is we have somehow found ways to keep thousands of girls going to school, informal schools, underground schools. That has all stopped.\"",
      "USAID's closure comes amid a study published in The Lancet on Monday that found cuts to USAID could cause more than 14 million additional deaths by 2030.",
      "Using models, the authors estimated the impact of USAID funding on deaths from 2001 to 2021. The team then used models to estimate effects up to five years from now.",
      "The study found that more than 91 million deaths were prevented by USAID funding to low-income and middle-income countries over the 21-year study period, including a 65% reduction in mortality from HIV/AIDS and a 51% reduction from malaria.",
      "Forecasting models not only predicted millions of additional deaths due to the steep cuts, but also that one-third of those deaths are projected to occur in children younger than age 5.",
      "The State Department official said such studies \"misapprehend\" the administration's new vision for foreign assistance and that reported life-and-death impacts \"is not what we're hearing on the ground.\"",
      "\"You can go back and relitigate all these little decisions. That's not our focus,\" the official said. \"That's not the secretary's focus. We are excited about what sort of the 'America First' foreign assistance agenda is going to look like, and how much impact we can have moving forward.\"",
      "The official said the new strategy would, for example, expect partners to take on more prevention work for patients with HIV infections and reduce their reliance on U.S.-funded programs for preventive health care.",
      "They noted that up to 90% of direct beneficiaries are receiving their medication under PEPFAR to date. There will be more investment in ending mother-to-child HIV transmission, the official said.",
      "\"The administration has a target of ending mother-child transmission by the time that President Trump leaves office, and we think that we can meet that and we're going to invest more in that particular space,\" the official said.",

      "Without Tillis on the ballot, Republicans have been floating their ideal candidate to hold onto their slim majority in the Senate, many of whom are less critical of President Donald Trump than Tillis, including allies Michael Whatley, chairman of the GOP, and the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump.",
      "A Republican National Committee official waved ABC News off the notion that Whatley, who used to lead the North Carolina GOP, was leaving his post, saying that Whatley currently has no plans to look at another office for the time being.",

      "\"I don't know who the candidates are going to be. I think you can have one of the congressmen step up,\" he said.",
      "Lara Trump, who ruled out a Senate run in Florida earlier in the year, would likely be the frontrunner if she entered. Other potential contenders, like Rep. Pat Harrigan said Tuesday in a post on X that he would back Lara Trump if she chose to run.",
      "\"There's lots of excitement around the 2026 Senate race, but let me be crystal clear about something: if @LaraLeaTrump enters this race, I'll be the first to endorse her and the first to fight for her victory,\" Harrigan wrote.",
      "In addition to Trump, other North Carolina Republicans who could be considering Senate bids including Reps. Greg Murphy and Addison McDowell, sources familiar with the situation told ABC News. North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, who chairs the campaign arm of House Republicans, said on Tuesday he would not run.",
      "Regardless of the candidate, the North Carolina GOP said in a statement it feels confident that another Republican will take Tillis' place.",
      "\"Senator Tillis has announced his decision to not seek re-election to the U.S. Senate and we wish him well in his retirement from public service. As we move forward into the midterm elections, we will hold this seat for Republicans in 2026 and continue to deliver on President Trump's America First priorities,\" North Carolina GOP Chairman Jason Simmons said.",
      "Democrats disagree and find Tillis' retirement an opportunity to make up for ground the lost in 2024. Former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel has already announced a run, and wrote on X on Sunday, \"Thom Tillis is out. No matter which MAGA loyalist Trump picks, I'm the only Democrat in this race and I'm ready to win.\"",
      "Yet the candidate atop North Carolina Democrats' wish list is their former governor, Roy Cooper. A spokesperson for Cooper told ABC News he's strongly considering a run and will announce his decision \"in the coming weeks.\"",
      "Anderson Clayton, the chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party, told ABC News in an interview Monday that as she has been \"going around the state and going around all my different counties, what I've heard the most from folks is that they would love to see Governor Cooper get in this race.\"",
      "But Clayton, even as she praised Cooper's strong approval ratings and the desire among many for him to run, pointed to a \"bench\" of others she said were strong candidates, including Nickel and Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt. A spokesperson for Hunt's lieutenant governor campaign told ABC News that Hunt believes Cooper will run but that \"if the field shifts, she'll give it thoughtful consideration.\"",
      "Clayton said she believes Democrats will handily flip the seat no matter who is on the ticket.",
      "\"I think that the Republican Party is running away from Thom Tillis, which is what we saw from the announcement [Sunday] ... We immediately saw the president deciding that he was going to find a primary challenger for Tillis. And I think it shows that North Carolina Democrats are in a prime position to be able to take this seat, especially now that it's an open seat,\" she said.",
      "She said the party had also seen an influx in donations and volunteers since Tillis announced his retirement.",
      "Cooper would be \"a real powerhouse\" if he decided to enter the race, Davidson College political science professor Susan Roberts told ABC News. She contrasted Cooper with the progressive New York Assembly member Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic primary nominee for mayor of New York City.",
      "\"[Cooper] may not be the shiniest object [or] have the campaign that helped Mamdani in the New York mayor's primary, he may not have that shiny social media presence, but I think he has the gravitas to be a good candidate, and I think he would know how to govern,\" Roberts said.",
      "Mac McCorkle, a professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy, said Lara Trump's powerful name recognition could clear the Republican primary field.",
      "\"The other Republicans who were thinking about it are kind of no-names,\" McCorkle said. \"I think it's Lara Trump's to refuse.\"",
      "He said while less-known candidates might need to take positions heavily to the right to win over \"the MAGA base\" in the primary, Lara Trump's connection to President Trump could help her gain support without having to do so, making her more appealing to moderate voters later on in the general election.",
      "On the other hand, Jason Roberts, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, saw Lara Trump's family connection to the president as a potential disadvantage.",
      "\"Midterm elections typically don't go well for the president's party, because the out-party is fired up. The in-party typically doesn't have as high a turnout,\" Roberts said. \"What successful presidential party candidates do in a midterm is they try to distinguish themselves from that president.

      "Vice President JD Vance was presiding over the chamber after breaking a tie on a previously considered wraparound amendment to the bill. It was assumed that he would soon break another tie on the bill's final passage, with a number of Republican holdouts remaining to make the vote math still uncertain.",
      "It was just a matter of who would be the third \"no\" vote Republicans could afford to lose and still pass the bill. Sens. Thom Tillis and Rand Paul had already committed to voting it down.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski was widely thought to be the last opponent, with a temporary SNAP carveout for her state of Alaska hanging in the balance down until the last minute.",
      "When the final vote started, Murkowski was seated in the second row near the middle of the chamber. Next to her was Mississippi GOP Sen. Roger Wicker and next to him was another moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who eventually proved to be the third and final GOP \"no\" vote.",
      "Collins, dressed in a hot-pink pantsuit, votes near the top of the alphabet. But she left near the beginning of the vote's final passage to go to the cloakroom. She missed her chance to vote when her name was called, coming out shortly after and walking directly to Murkowski. Collins put her arm around Murkowski, and then went up to the clerk and put her thumb down: no. She then left the chamber.",
      "Focus was then squarely on Murkowski, whose vote could have tanked the entire bill. But former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell came up to sit next to her. The two talked quietly and then shook hands. When her name was called, Murkowski quietly said \"Aye.\"",
      "Senators had added additional sweeteners for her state, including a provision aimed at insulating Alaska from some of the bill\u2019s harshest impacts on SNAP.",
      "She then started to leave the chamber, shaking hands with GOP Sens. Jerry Moran of Kansas and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana before exiting.",
      "Afterward, Murkowski told ABC News' she \u201cstruggled mightily with the [bill\u2019s] impact on the most vulnerable in this country.\u201d",
      "\"I needed help, and I worked to get that every single day. And did I get everything that I wanted? Absolutely not,\u201d she added.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune didn't speak to either woman after their votes. He was seated in his chair in the front of the chamber.",
      "Collins later explained her vote in a statement: \"My vote against this bill stems primarily from the harmful impact it will have on Medicaid, affecting low-income families and rural health care providers like our hospitals and nursing homes.\"",
      "She also said she had problems with cuts to energy tax credits and that the rural hospital relief fund that was created to try to get Republican holdouts to vote for the bill was insufficient.",
      "The drama wasn't over after the final vote -- Murkowski appeared exasperated when asked about Paul's criticism over her vote and what deals Alaska might have benefitted from.",
      "When asked by an NBC reporter about Paul saying Alaska had gotten a bailout for her vote at the expense of the country, Murkowski replied, \"Oh my God.\"",
      "Murkowski stared the reporter down before he finally said, \u201cI didn\u2019t say it, ma\u2019am, I\u2019m just asking for your response.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy response is I have an obligation to the people of the state of Alaska, and I live up to that every single day. I fight for my state's interests, and I make sure that Alaskans are understood. I work hard to take care of a state that has more unique situations, more unique people, and it's just different,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAnd so when people suggest that federal dollars go to one of our 50 states in a, quote, \"bailout,\" I find that offensive,\" she went on. \"I advocated my state's interests. I will continue to do that, and I will make no excuses for doing that.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I like this bill? No. But I tried to take care of Alaska's interests,\" she said. \"But I know, I know that in many parts of the country, there are Americans that are not going to be advantaged by this bill. I don't like that.\u201d",
      "Murkowski then blasted the \u201cartificial\u201d deadline placed on the bill in order to get it done for Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants it on his desk by Friday -- the Fourth of July.",
      "\u201cI don't like the fact that we moved through an artificial deadline, an artificial timeline, to produce something to meet a deadline, rather than to actually try to produce the best bill for the country. But when I saw the direction that this is going, you can -- you can either say 'I don't like it,' not try to help my state, or you can roll up your sleeves,\u201d she concluded.",

      "Experts say work requirements might force people off Medicaid.",
      "As Republicans work to pass President Donald Trump's reconciliation bill by his July 4 deadline, many are worried about the changes that could be coming to Medicaid.",
      "Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services works with state programs to administer Medicaid, which enrolls more than 71.2 million people.",
      "The original measure passed by the House made around $600 billion in cuts to Medicaid, which then faced deeper cuts in the Senate.",
      "New estimates from the Congressional Budget Office project federal spending on Medicaid will be reduced by $1 trillion and that the current version of the bill in the Senate would increase the number of uninsured by 11.8 million by 2034.",
      "The passage of the bill would go against Trump's repeated promises to keep Medicaid intact.",
      "Health policy experts and health care workers say sharp Medicaid cuts could result in vulnerable Americans no longer being able to receive care, either by losing coverage or by closing the centers that provide such care.",
      "Work requirements could result in lost coverage",
      "The bill imposes new 80-hour per month work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients aged 19 to 64 who don't have dependents. These requirements include working or other approved activities, such as volunteering.",
      "There are exemptions for parents or guardians of children under age 14 and those with disabilities. Under the bill's current text, these work requirements won't kick in until 2026.",
      "An analysis published last week from the UC Berkley Labor Center found that work requirements could have a devastating impact on older Americans, between ages 50 and 64.",
      "Nari Rhee, director of the Retirement Security Program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center and author of the analysis, told ABC News that after age 50, employment becomes increasingly difficult.",
      "For instance, many older workers become physically unable to continue employment until they reach retirement age.",
      "\"Most people hope and plan to retire at something like age 65, but life happens and quite often what happens is people start having health issues,\" Rhee said. \"If you've had blue collar work or manual work, often you started working probably in your late teens. And so, by the time you get into your 50s, your late 50s, your body is just really worn out, and you're not no longer able to work the kinds of jobs that you used to do.\"",
      "She added that some older workers who are physically unable to do the jobs they used to do or who were laid off have a hard time finding employment again due to age discrimination.",
      "Additionally, many older adults are responsible for caring for family members including spouses and parents, which may mean leaving the workplace entirely.",
      "\"In practical terms, there are all kinds of legitimate reasons why, especially older adults, might not be able to meet the work requirements in terms of actually putting in the number of hours, and that's before we even get to all the administrative issues,\" Rhee said. \"Even if you do work, you might not be able to navigate the red tape.\"",
      "AARP, an interest group that focusing on issues affecting those 50 and older in the U.S., sent a letter over the weekend to Sen. Majority Leader John Thune and Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressing opposition to a provision that would disqualify people who fail to meet Medicaid work requirements from receiving Affordable Care Act premium tax credits.",
      "\"This creates a steep coverage cliff for those in their 50s and early 60s -- particularly for those nearing retirement or working part-time -- who may be left with no affordable coverage option at all.\"",
      "Risk of rural hospitals, health centers closing",
      "Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurse Association, said cuts to Medicaid could force rural hospitals and community health centers to close.",
      "Although Senate Republicans have proposed a $25 billion rural health stabilization fund due to cuts to the Medicaid provider tax, it is unclear if that will be enough to prevent hospitals from closing.",
      "Many rural health care centers receive revenue from patients covered by Medicaid and losing that revenue could be costly.",
      "\"These hospitals have been on the verge of tight finances for years, and this could be enough to shut them down,\" Mensik Kennedy told ABC News. \"If we have cuts to Medicaid, we're going to see these hospitals start to shutter their doors, and people are going to have to drive three, four, hours to deliver a baby, to go have emergency care to get seen, and that's got to be unacceptable to everyone.\"",
      "Arnulfo De La Cruz, president of SEIU 2015, the nation's largest long-term care union and California's largest labor union, concurred, saying cuts to Medicaid would impact states' ability to provide health coverage and long-term care, particularly for rural and low-income Americans.",
      "\"Any cuts to Medicaid, the impact in California would be devastating \u2026 Medicaid is really the core of how the long-term care system is structured and funded,\" he told ABC News. \"Medicaid helps to fund clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, home care -- it's all connected as part of our health delivery system. If you were to dismantle or cut to the extent that they're talking about, I think you see clinics close, you see hospitals close, you see nursing homes close.\"",
      "He went on, \"I think it would have a devastating impact on the ability for rural Californians and low-income Californians to be able to access their health care, thereby becoming sicker and having to look to much more high-cost alternatives.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said his mass deportations would target criminals -- but new data shows a recent shift toward also arresting those who have not been accused of crimes.",
    "story": [
      "ICE is arresting more and more migrants who have not been accused of crimes.",
      "President Donald Trump campaigned for president on the promise of mass deportations that targeted criminals -- and while ICE agents have arrested over 38,000 migrants with criminal convictions, new data shows a recent shift toward also arresting those who have not been accused of crimes.",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump administration has arrested an increasing number of migrants with no criminal convictions, according to an ABC News analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data.",
      "The numbers, which were obtained through a public records lawsuit and released by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California Berkeley, give the first real glimpse of how Trump's immigration enforcement policy is playing out in the streets.",
      "Over the first five months of the Trump administration, ICE has arrested over 95,000 individuals, according to data analyzed by ABC's owned television stations' data team.",
      "At the start of the administration, ICE tended to target migrants with pending or criminal convictions. From Inauguration Day to May 4, 2025, 44% of those arrested had a criminal conviction, while 34% of those arrested had pending charges and 23% had no criminal history, according to the data.",
      "But beginning May 25, the data appears to show there was a shift in enforcement -- with individuals with criminal convictions making up only 30% of those arrested. Those arrested with pending criminal charges accounted for 26% of the individuals arrested and 44% had no criminal history.",
      "\"It looks like there's been a shift from about Memorial Day this year up until now, to an increasing number of people who have been detained who have no criminal charges,\" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who reviewed the data.",
      "\"We hear a lot about the administration deporting the worst of the worst. And as far as we can tell from all available data up to this point, the data has not really supported that,\" Kocher said.",
      "The data is largely divided into three groups of individuals: those who have criminal convictions, those with pending charges, and those who may be facing civil immigration charges, labeled as \"other immigration violators.\" However, the data provides no indication of what kind of crimes the individuals may be accused or convicted of.",
      "In Los Angeles, where ICE raids recently sparked large demonstrations, and in the New York City area, almost 60% of those arrested by ICE in the first ten days of June had no criminal convictions nor any pending criminal charges, according to the data.",
      "Asked about the shift, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News, \"We are not going to disclose law enforcement sensitive intelligence and methods. 70% of the arrests ICE made were of criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"We are continuing to go after the worst of the worst -- including gang members, pedophiles, and rapists,\" McLaughlin said. \"Under Secretary [Kristi] Noem, we are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe.\"",
      "The majority of administration's migrant arrests have taken place in Texas, the state with the longest southern border. But the data also shows that enforcement has largely shifted away from apprehensions at the southern border to apprehensions in the interior of the country.",
      "John Sandweg, the former acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama, told ABC News that the shift in enforcement is not a surprise, considering that illegal border crossings are down dramatically.",
      "\"For the last probably 15 years at least, the majority of ICE arrests, people booked into ICE custody or ICE apprehensions, were individuals apprehended at the border. But now, the administration is very sensitive to the numbers and has started putting ICE under pressure,\" Sandweg said, referring to Trump's call for more migrants to be deported.",
      "\"The problem is that you are now engaged in operations that are, frankly, more likely to find non-criminals than criminals,\" Sandweg said.",
      "As ABC News previously reported, ICE's latest tactic has been arresting individuals at immigration courts. In most cases, when a deportation case is dismissed, it is a positive outcome for a migrant, attorneys told ABC News -- but according to immigration attorneys and advocates, immigration enforcement officers have been waiting in immigration court buildings and coordinating with DHS lawyers to arrest migrants promptly after their cases are dismissed, after which the migrants are placed into expedited removal proceedings without allowing them to fight their case.",
      "\"If there's anything that says this isn't about serious criminal enforcement, it's this wholesale dismissal of cases of the people who are showing up in immigration court,\" Sandweg said. \"I mean, you want to find the place where you're least likely to find dangerous criminals -- it's the people who show up for their immigration court hearings.\"",
      "Sandweg said these new types of enforcement, including courthouse arrests, are being made in an effort to achieve quotas set by the Trump administration.",
      "\"It's another way to just quickly make some arrests,\" Sandweg said.",
      "The administration, meanwhile, says it's continuing its efforts to target accused criminals.",
      "At a press conference on Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal authorities have arrested 2,711 alleged multinational gang members since Trump re-took office in January.",
      "\"You should all feel safer that President Trump can deport all of these gangs and not one district court judge can think they're emperor over this Trump administration and his executive powers,\" she said.",

      "The president congratulated officials on how quickly it was put together.",
      "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he would like to see facilities like the new so-called \"Alligator Alcatraz\" migrant detention center in Florida's Everglades in other states.",
      "\"Well, I think would like to see them in many states. Really, many states,\" the president said. \"And, you know, at some point, they might morph into a system.\"",
      "The Trump administration is turning the remote Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport into a facility that officials say will eventually hold up to 5,000 people. Officials say operations will start on Tuesday. The facility is part of Trump\u2019s efforts to ramp up deportations by expanding detention capacity. The president has already sent migrants to Guant\u00e1namo Bay and the mega-prison in El Salvador.",
      "Asked by ABC News' Mary Bruce if the new center could be a new standard for immigration facilities in the U.S. despite criticism for its harsh conditions, Trump said, \"It can be.\"",
      "\"I mean, you don't always have land so beautiful and so secure. They have a lot of bodyguards and a lot of cops that are in the form of alligators. You don\u2019t have to pay them so much but I wouldn't want to run through the Everglades for long. It will keep people where they're supposed to be. This is a very important thing,\" he said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump's visit would be a chance for the president to tout the funding for more detention facilities and efforts to enact Trump's mass deportation policy that are in his megabill that the Senate could vote on Tuesday before sending to the House before Trump's Fourth of July deadline.",
      "\"I think his trip to this detention facility actually underscores the need to pass the One Big, Beautiful Bill because we need more detention facilities across the country,\" Leavitt said.",
      "A source familiar with the planning tells ABC it will cost Florida $450 million a year, and officials say some of that money will be reimbursed from FEMA's Shelter and Services Program.",
      "Leavitt described the facility's remote location in her briefing on Monday.",
      "\"There's only one road leading in, and the only way out is a one-way flight,\" she said. \"It is isolated and surrounded by dangerous wildlife and unforgiving terrain. The facility will have up to 5,000 beds to house, process and deport criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"This is an efficient and low-cost way to help carry out the largest mass deportation campaign in American history,\" Leavitt added.",
      "When asked about the remote and dangerous location, Leavitt said that it was a feature of the facility to help prevent detainees from escaping.",
      "\"Well look, when you have illegal murderers and rapists and heinous criminals in a detention facility surrounded by alligators, yes, I do think that's a deterrent for them to try to escape,\" she said. \"We do know that some of these illegal criminals have escaped from other detention facilities, like one in New Jersey, which I know was recently reported on. So, of course, we want to keep the American people safe, and we want to remove these public safety threats from our streets, and we want to effectively detain them as best as we can.\"",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier posted on X that the facility is a \u201cone stop shop\u201d to carry out Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda, claiming the location saves money on security since it\u2019s surrounded by dangerous animals.",
      "\u201cYou don't need to invest that much in the perimeter. People get out, there's not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons. Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide,\u201d Uthmeier posted.",
      "Among officials who will join Trump at the facility are Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Congressman Byron Donalds.",
      "In a statement released Monday, Noem said, \u201cAlligator Alcatraz, and other facilities like it, will give us the capability to lock up some of the worst scumbags who entered our country under the previous administration. We will expand facilities and bed space in just days, thanks to our partnership with Florida. Make America safe again.\"",
      "DeSantis touted the facility last week as \u201cas safe and secure as you can be.\u201d",
      "Environmental groups are suing to stop construction, alleging the government violated the Endangered Species Act by building on protected land.",

      "Group and solo travelers are trickling into Afghanistan by plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- By plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles, tourists are beginning to discover Afghanistan, with solo travelers and tour groups gradually venturing into a country that until recently was wracked by war.",
      "And the country\u2019s Taliban government, which seized power more than three years ago but has yet to be formally recognized by any other nation, is more than happy to welcome them.",
      "\u201cThe Afghan people are warm and welcoming and wish to host tourists from other countries and engage with them,\u201d Deputy Minister of Tourism Qudratullah Jamal told The Associated Press in an early June interview. \u201cTourism brings many benefits to a country. We have considered those benefits and aim for our nation to take full advantage of them.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a vital, multi-billion-dollar industry for many countries.",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s isolation on the international stage, largely because of the Taliban\u2019s restrictions on women and girls, has left much of its 41 million people mired in poverty. As it struggles to attract foreign investment, the lucrative potential of tourism is far from lost on the government.",
      "\u201cWe are currently earning a considerable amount of revenue from this industry, and we are hopeful it will grow even more in the future,\u201d Jamal said, noting money spent by visitors can reach more layers of society than revenue from other industries. \u201cWe are optimistic this sector will evolve into a large economy, bringing significant benefits. It plays an important role in strengthening our national economy.\u201d",
      "Tourist visas are quick and easy to obtain and flights from major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul operate several times a week. The government has even set up a training institute for men \u2014 and it is only for men \u2014 seeking jobs in the hospitality and tourism sector.",
      "While visitor numbers are still very much a trickle rather than a flood, they are increasing. Nearly 9,000 foreign tourists visited Afghanistan last year, while nearly 3,000 people visited in the first three months of this year, Jamal said.",
      "Four decades of near-continuous conflict kept nearly all vacationers away from this landlocked country of towering mountains, deep gorges and millennia of history.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s takeover from a U.S.-backed government in August 2021 stunned the world and sent thousands of Afghans fleeing. But with the insurgency over, the bloodshed from frequent bombings and suicide attacks all but ended too.",
      "Attacks still occur, however. An Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains active and gunmen killed six people, including three Spanish tourists, in a May 2024 attack in Bamiyan, one of the country\u2019s main tourist attractions where centuries-old giant Buddhas carved into the cliffs were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.",
      "While Western countries still advise against travel to Afghanistan, a drop in violence from the two decades of U.S.-led military presence is indisputable, as the government is keen to point out.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan has gone through many years of war and hardship. Now, we want tourists to come and see the true traditions and customs of Afghans, to understand Afghan life, creativity and resilience,\u201d Jamal said, noting there was \u201ccomprehensive security across Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Critics question the ethics of foreigners visiting Afghanistan for pleasure when its government discriminates so heavily against half the country\u2019s population.",
      "Education beyond primary school level is banned for girls and women and few professions are open to them. Women cannot enter parks, gardens or gyms.",
      "Beauty salons are forbidden. Authorities dictate how women dress and have demanded they cover their faces in public, a decree still flouted by many, particularly in Kabul.",

      "Civil and voting rights activists gathered in Jackson, Mississippi, to honor what would have been the 100th birthday of civil rights leader Medgar Evers",
      "Jackson, Miss. -- More than 60 years after a white supremacist assassinated civil rights leader Medgar Evers, his daughter still sees the same strain of political violence at work in American society.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d said Reena Evers-Everette. \u201cIt\u2019s very painful.\u201d",
      "Evers-Everette was 8 years old when her father, a field secretary for the NAACP, was shot to death in the driveway of his home in Jackson, Mississippi.",
      "A few months after Evers\u2019 killing in 1963, President John F. Kennedy was gunned down. The deaths of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy followed later that decade.",
      "Now, experts say the level of political violence in America over the past few years is likely the highest it\u2019s been since the 1960s and 1970s. The past year alone has seen the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, the killing of two Israeli Embassy staffers, and two assassination attempts on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.",
      "At a four-day conference celebrating Evers' life just before what would have been his 100th birthday on July 2, his daughter was joined by the daughters of slain civil rights leaders: Kerry Kennedy, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, and Bettie Dahmer, the daughter of civil and voting rights activist Vernon Dahmer. The 2025 Democracy in Action Convening, \u201cMedgar Evers at 100: a Legacy of Justice, a Future of Change,\u201d was held in Jackson.",
      "\u201cI just was feeling so much pain, and I didn't want anyone else to have to go through that,\u201d Kennedy said, recalling that after her father died, she prayed for the man who killed him. \u201cI was saying, \u2018Please don\u2019t \u2014 please don't kill the guy that killed him.'\u201d",
      "Two-time Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams spoke at the event, denouncing efforts by the Trump administration to strip the names of activists from Navy vessels, including possibly Evers.",
      "\u201cThey want to take his name off a boat because they don't want us to have a reminder of how far he sailed us forward,\u201d Abrams told the conference crowd.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has undertaken an effort to change the names of ships and military bases that were given by President Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic administration, which often honored service members who were women, people of color, or from the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "Abrams drew parallels between acts of radical political violence and the Trump administration's use of military resources against protesters in Los Angeles who were demonstrating against immigration enforcement actions.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we cannot decry political violence and then sanction the sending of the Marines and the National Guard to stop protesters and not believe that that conflicting message doesn\u2019t communicate itself,\u201d Abrams told The Associated Press. \u201cWhat I want us to remember is that whether it is Medgar Evers or Melissa Hortman, no one who is willing to speak for the people should have their lives cut short because of what they say.\u201d",
      "In addition to her father's life and legacy, Evers-Everette wants people to remember the hatred that led to his assassination.",
      "\u201cWe have to make sure we know what our history is,\u201d she said. \"So we don't repeat the crazy, nasty, racist mess.\"",

      "On a recent day, dozens of people arrived with medication, clothing and hope of seeing their loved one, if only briefly.

      "BOISE, Idaho -- More than two years after the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students shocked the rural community of Moscow, Idaho, the former criminal justice doctoral student charged in the murders is expected in court Wednesday to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty.",
      "Bryan Kohberger agreed to the plea deal in the past few days, just weeks before his trial was to begin, after his attorneys tried but failed to have execution stricken as a possible punishment. The deal drew mixed reactions from the victims' families, ranging from support to outrage that Kohberger would live.",
      "\u201cBryan Kohberger facing a life in prison means he would still get to speak, form relationships, and engage with the world,\u201d Aubrie Goncalves, the 18-year-old sister of victim Kaylee Goncalves, wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cMeanwhile, our loved ones have been silenced forever. That reality stings more deeply when it feels like the system is protecting his future more than honoring the victims\u2019 pasts.\u201d",
      "The small farming community of Moscow, in the northern Idaho panhandle, had not had a homicide in about five years when Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen were found dead at a rental home near campus on Nov. 13, 2022. Autopsies showed the four victims were all likely asleep when they were attacked. Some had defensive wounds and each was stabbed multiple times.",
      "The killings prompted a massive hunt for the perpetrator. That included an elaborate effort to track down a white sedan that was seen on surveillance cameras repeatedly driving by the rental home, using genetic genealogy to identify Kohberger as a possible suspect, and using cellphone data to pinpoint his movements the night of the killings.",
      "At the time, Kohberger was a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University, about 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) west of the University of Idaho. He was arrested in Pennsylvania, where his parents lived, weeks later. Investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene.",
      "Online shopping records showed that Kohberger had purchased a military-style knife months earlier \u2014 as well as a sheath like the one found at the scene.",
      "No motive has emerged for the killings, nor is it clear why the attacker spared two roommates who were in the home. Authorities have said cellphone data and surveillance video show that Kohberger visited the victims\u2019 neighborhood at least a dozen times before the killings.",
      "Kohberger is due to appear at 11 a.m. MDT Wednesday before Idaho Fourth Judicial District Judge Steven Hippler in Boise, where the case was moved due to pretrial publicity in northern Idaho. Hippler must approve the plea deal. If Kohberger pleads guilty as expected, he would likely be sentenced in July.",
      "While the Goncalves family opposed the agreement and said they would seek to stop it, they also argued that any such deal should require Kohberger to make a full confession, detail the facts of what happened and provide the location of the murder weapon.",
      "\"We deserve to know when the beginning of the end was,\u201d they wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "The family of Chapin \u2014 one of three triplets who attended the university together \u2014 supports the deal, their spokesperson, Christina Teves, said Tuesday. Attorney Leander James, who represents Mogen\u2019s mother and stepfather, declined to give their views but said he would deliver a statement on their behalf after Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Mogen\u2019s father, Ben Mogen, told CBS News he was relieved by the agreement.",
      "\u201cWe can actually put this behind us and not have these future dates and future things that we don\u2019t want to have to be at, that we shouldn\u2019t have to be at, that have to do with this terrible person,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get to just think about the rest of lives and have to try and figure out how to do it without Maddie and the rest of the kids.\u201d",

      "A federal judge in New York has blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary legal status for more than 500,000 Haitians who are already in the United States",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge in New York on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary legal status for more than 500,000 Haitians who are already in the United States.",
      "District Court Judge Brian M. Cogan in New York ruled that moving up the expiration of the temporary protected status, or TPS, by at least five months for Haitians, some of whom have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, is unlawful.",
      "The Biden administration had extended Haiti\u2019s TPS status through at least Feb. 3, 2026, due to gang violence, political unrest, a major earthquake in 2021 and several other factors, according to court documents.",
      "But last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was terminating those legal protections as soon as Sept. 2, setting Haitians up for potential deportation. The department said the conditions in the country had improved and Haitians no longer met the conditions for the temporary legal protections.",
      "The ruling comes as President Donald Trump works to end protections and programs for immigrants as part of his mass deportations promises.",
      "The judge's 23-page opinion states that the Department of Homeland Security 's move to terminate the legal protections early violates the TPS statute that requires a certain amount of notice before reconsidering a designation.",
      "\u201cWhen the Government confers a benefit over a fixed period of time, a beneficiary can reasonably expect to receive that benefit at least until the end of that fixed period,\u201d according to the ruling.",
      "The judge also referenced the fact that the plaintiffs have started jobs, enrolled in schools and begun receiving medical treatment with the expectations that the country's TPS designation would run through the end of the year.",
      "Manny Pastreich, president of the Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ, which filed the lawsuit, described the ruling as an \u201cimportant step\u201d but said the fight is not over.",
      "\u201cWe will keep fighting to make sure this decision is upheld,\" Pastreich said in a statement. \"We will keep fighting for the rights of our members and all immigrants against the Trump Administration \u2013 in the streets, in the workplace, and in the courts as well. And when we fight, we win.\"",
      "DHS did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment. But the government had argued that TPS is a temporary program and thus \u201cthe termination of a country\u2019s TPS designation is a possibility beneficiaries must always expect.\"",
      "Haiti's TPS status was initially activated in 2010 after the catastrophic earthquake and has been extended multiple times, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Gang violence has displaced 1.3 million people across Haiti as the local government and international community struggle with the spiraling crisis, according to a report from the International Organization for Migration. There has been a 24% increase in displaced people since December, with gunmen having chased 11% of Haiti\u2019s nearly 12 million inhabitants from their home, the report said.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to strip Temporary Protected Status from 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation. The order put on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that kept the legal protections in place.",
      "The judge's decision in New York also comes on the heels of the Trump administration revoking legal protections for thousands of Haitians who arrived legally in the U.S. through a humanitarian parole program.",

      "The leader of an MS-13 gang clique in the New York City suburbs is facing sentencing in a federal racketeering case involving eight murders, including the 2016 killings of two high school girls on Long Island",
      "CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. -- The leader of an MS-13 clique in the suburbs of New York City faces sentencing Wednesday in a federal racketeering case involving eight murders, including the 2016 killings of two high school girls that focused the nation\u2019s attention on the violent Central American street gang.",
      "Alexi Saenz pleaded guilty last year for his role in ordering and approving the killings as well as other crimes during a rash of bloody violence that prompted President Donald Trump to make several visits to Long Island and call for the death penalty for Saenz and other gang members during his first term in the White House.",
      "Saenz\u2019s lawyers are seeking a sentence of 45 years behind bars, but prosecutors want the judge to impose the maximum sentence of 70 years.",
      "Prosecutors, who previously withdrew their intent to seek the death penalty, say Saenz deserves to live out his days in prison for his \u201csenseless\u201d and \u201csadistic\u201d crimes.",
      "\u201cThe eight victims who lost their lives did nothing to deserve what the MS-13 did to them,\u201d they wrote in legal filings ahead of Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cThe defendant and the others killed them in service of the gang without remorse or any regard for them as human beings.\u201d",
      "But Saenz's lawyers have argued for leniency, saying in their own legal filings that the now-30-year-old is remorseful and \u201con a journey of redemption\u201d while incarcerated.",
      "\"With the passage of time and much reflection, it is hard for Mr. Saenz to reconcile the person he is today with the person he was when he committed the crimes,\" their sentencing memo reads. \u201cHe is profoundly sorry, and although he knows the families may not accept his apology, it is sincere, and he accepts full responsibility for his participation in these crimes.\u201d",
      "Saenz's lawyers also say he suffers from intellectual disabilities and lasting trauma from an abusive father and difficult upbringing in El Salvador. They say Saenz was recruited and unwittingly \u201cgroomed\u201d into MS-13 because he was an \u201ceasily influenced\u201d and \u201cgullible\u201d high school student on Long Island.",
      "Prosecutors, however, counter that Saenz has remained \u201cfirmly entrenched\u201d in MS-13 while in a federal lockup in Brooklyn for the past eight years.",
      "They cited photos of him posing with other gang members behind bars and displaying gang signs and gang paraphernalia. They also say Saenz has been disciplined for assaulting other inmates, refusing staff orders and possessing sharpened metal shanks, cellphones and other contraband.",
      "\u201cIndeed, the same pattern of violence and mayhem that has marked his life on the street has not waned with the passage of time,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Saenz, also known as \u201cBlasty\u201d and \u201cBig Homie,\u201d was the leader of an MS-13 clique operating in Brentwood and Central Islip known as Sailors Locos Salvatruchas Westside.",
      "He admitted last July that he\u2019d authorized the eight killings and three other attempted killings of perceived rivals and others that had disrespected or feuded with the clique.",
      "Saenz also admitted to arson, firearms offenses and drug trafficking \u2014 the proceeds of which went toward buying firearms, more drugs and providing contributions to the wider MS-13 gang.",
      "Among the killings Saenz oversaw were the deaths of Kayla Cuevas, 16, and Nisa Mickens, 15, lifelong friends and classmates at Brentwood High School who were slain with a machete and a baseball bat.",
      "Other victims included Javier Castillo, 15, of Central Islip, who was befriended by gang members only to be cut down with a machete in an isolated marsh.",
      "Another victim, Oscar Acosta, 19, was found dead in a wooded area near railroad tracks nearly five months after he left his Brentwood home to play soccer.",
      "MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a transnational criminal organization believed to have been founded as a neighborhood street gang in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s by people fleeing civil war in El Salvador.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The United States. Australia, India and Japan have agreed to expand their cooperation on maritime security in the Indo-Pacific and further collaborate on supplies of critical minerals and rare earths that are key components of high-tech production.",
      "The foreign ministers of the four countries, known as the \u201cQuad,\u201d met in Washington on Tuesday as the Trump administration seeks to expand U.S. influence in the Indo-Pacific to compete with a rising China amid tensions with partners over trade and defense issues.",
      "In a joint meeting with his three colleagues, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Quad must be a \u201cvehicle for action\u201d that goes beyond statements of intent and stressed that commerce and trade will be critical to ensuring the group\u2019s relevance in the future.",
      "To that end, the four announced in a statement the creation of a \u201cQuad Critical Minerals Initiative\u201d that aims \u201cto strengthen economic security and collective resilience by collaborating on securing and diversifying critical mineral supply chains.\u201d The statement did not provide details of the initiative.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the abrupt constriction and future reliability of key supply chains, specifically for critical minerals,\u201d they said. \u201cThis includes the use of non-market policies and practices for critical minerals, certain derivative products, and mineral processing technology.\u201d",
      "The statement did not mention China by name, but Chinese domination of the critical minerals supply chain has long been a concern of the U.S. and others. The ministers expressed specific concern about rising tensions in the East and South China Seas, where Beijing has become increasingly assertive of maritime and territorial claims that are rejected by its smaller neighbors.",
      "\u201cWe reiterate our strong opposition to any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion,\u201d they said. \u201cWe express our serious concerns regarding dangerous and provocative actions, including interference with offshore resource development, the repeated obstruction of the freedoms of navigation and overflight, and the dangerous maneuvers by military aircraft and coast guard and maritime militia vessels, especially the unsafe use of water cannons and ramming or blocking actions in the South China Sea.\u201d",
      "The ministers also condemned North Korea for continuing to launch ballistic missiles, expand its nuclear weapons program and engage in malicious cyberactivity. In a veiled reference to North Korean support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, they expressed \u201cdeep concern about countries that are deepening military cooperation with North Korea, which directly undermines the global nonproliferation regime.\u201d",

      "CHAPIN, S.C. -- Former South Carolina Lt. Gov. Andr\u00e9 Bauer is mounting a GOP primary challenge to Sen. Lindsey Graham, arguing the incumbent isn't conservative enough to represent the state.",
      "Bauer, a wealthy developer, is a longtime backer of President Donald Trump. His candidacy sets up a midterm grudge match with Graham, a four-term senator whose relationship with Trump has undulated through the years, but who has Trump's endorsement for reelection.",
      "Bauer has described himself as \u201ca real, America First conservative\u201d intent on representing what he sees as South Carolina conservatives\u2019 true values.",
      "\u201cI think Graham's been there too long, and he votes like it,\u201d Bauer told The Associated Press Tuesday night. \u201cI'm guaranteed, I'm conservative, and I don't think he is.\"",
      "Republicans dominate South Carolina\u2019s statewide-elected positions, meaning that the most intense political competition takes place in GOP primaries.",
      "Graham has faced previous primary challenges from the right, with opponents accusing him of kowtowing to Democrats on issues from immigration to climate change. But he also hews to Republican priorities on national security; ahead of last month\u2019s U.S. strike on Iranian facilities, Graham called for Trump to \u201cgo all-in\u201d in backing Israel and destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Graham kicked off his reelection campaign in February, and at least one other Republican has also announced a primary challenge.",
      "He has already secured Trump\u2019s endorsement. This week, Graham's campaign announced that Chris LaCivita, a co-campaign manager of Trump\u2019s 2024 bid, would serve as a senior adviser. On Tuesday, Abby Zilch, spokeswoman for Graham\u2019s campaign, noted that the senator had earned Trump\u2019s \u201ccomplete and total endorsement,\u201d adding that Bauer \u201chas spent his career chasing titles to feed his ego.\u201d",
      "Bauer said he understood Trump\u2019s need to use Capitol Hill relationships to advance his legislative priorities, like the tax cuts and spending bill that came before the Senate Budget Committee \u2014 which Graham chairs \u2014 before passing the chamber earlier Tuesday.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s got to work and get his bills passed,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cLindsey\u2019s chairman of a major committee. ... I get what you have to do.\"",
      "Bauer has backed Trump since before his win in South Carolina\u2019s 2016 GOP primary. At his 2024 campaign's South Carolina launch event, Trump called Bauer \u2014 who served on his state leadership committee \u2014 \u201ca friend of mine, somebody that could I think run for almost any office and win.\u201d",
      "Bauer served in the South Carolina legislature before, at 33, he was elected the youngest lieutenant governor in the country in 2002. After two terms, he mounted an unsuccessful 2010 gubernatorial bid, finishing last in a four-way GOP primary ultimately won by Nikki Haley.",
      "Two years later, Bauer ran for Congress, losing a GOP runoff to eventual Rep. Tom Rice in South Carolina\u2019s newly created 7th District.",
      "Asked how much of his own money he would commit, Bauer declined to give a figure, saying he would \u201cput skin in the campaign\u201d and looked forward to returning to the trail.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to cover this state like the dew covers Dixie,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a movement.\u201d",

      "Residents are expressing a mix of relief and anger in the small Idaho college town where four students were stabbed to death after the news that the man charged had agreed to plead guilty",
      "MOSCOW, Idaho -- Residents expressed a mix of relief and anger Tuesday in the small Idaho college town where four students were stabbed to death in 2022 after news that the man charged in the killings had agreed to plead guilty to avoid a trial and a possible death penalty.",
      "Bryan Kohberger, 30, is expected to plead guilty on Wednesday to charges that he murdered University of Idaho students Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen at a rental home near the Moscow campus in November 2022.",
      "No motive has emerged for the killings, which stunned a community that's still healing \u2014 and news of the plea deal elicited mixed reactions from Moscow residents.",
      "Telisa Swan had thanked authorities with a message on her tattoo shop's marquee after Kohberger was arrested in early 2023. On Tuesday, Swan said she\u2019s disappointed the victims' families may not get full answers if Kohberger \u2019s quadruple-murder trial doesn\u2019t happen next month.",
      "\u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s admitting his guilt right now, finally,\u201d Swan said, adding that the \u201cdeath penalty would have been an easy way out for him. He should suffer in prison for a very long time.\u201d",
      "With word of a plea deal, news crews descended Tuesday on Moscow's main street, where every other storefront boasts the University of Idaho's colors, flags and insignia.",
      "The nearby campus was quiet, with summer break in full swing. Bouquets of flowers and candles adorned the names of the victims etched on metal plaques at a campus healing garden and memorial opened in 2024 that honors the four students and others who lost their lives while enrolled at the university.",
      "The off-campus home where the killings took place was demolished in 2023, leaving behind an empty lot with dry grass and weathered mementos from a makeshift memorial there.",
      "Moscow resident Luke Brunaugh, who said he lives less than a mile from where the killings happened, didn\u2019t like that a deal would mean the death penalty option would go away, saying that should be the punishment for murder.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just unfair to the families,\" said Brunaugh. \u201cIt allows him to hide. He never had to really go to trial. He is answering to his crimes, but not to the fullest extent in my opinion.\u201d",
      "In Idaho, judges have the option to reject plea agreements, but that is rare. If Kohberger pleads guilty on Wednesday, he is expected to be sentenced in late July.",
      "Kohberger, who was a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University at the time of the killings, was arrested after investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene.",
      "Heidi Barnett said she felt trepidation when her son chose the University of Idaho as his college three years ago. Visiting him in Moscow Tuesday, Barnett said a long trial would have been very emotional for the families.",
      "\u201cI would think life in prison sometimes would be harder, so I kind of looked at it that way,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not the parent, but I would be happy with that.\u201d",

The person was not authorized to publicly discuss a personnel matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "A department spokesperson declined to comment. The New York Times was first to report on Wise's appointment.",
      "When Trump returned to the White House in January, he picked Martin to serve as interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. But the president pulled his nomination to keep the job on a more permanent basis two days after a key Republican senator said he could not support Martin for the job due to his defense of Capitol rioters.",
      "Martin was a leading figure in Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement. He spoke at a rally in Washington on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. He represented three Jan. 6 defendants and served on the board of the nonprofit Patriot Freedom Project, which reports raising over $2.5 million to support riot defendants.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi called for creating the \u201cweaponization\u201d group in February to investigate claims by Trump and Republican allies that the Justice Department unfairly targeted conservatives during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. The group's review includes the work of former special counsel Jack Smith, who led two federal prosecutions of Trump that were ultimately abandoned after Trump was elected to a second term.",
      "Fox News host Jeanine Pirro replaced Martin as the top federal prosecutor in Washington, but Martin immediately moved over to his current Justice Department position.",
      "Wise, who worked as a special agent or supervisory special agent for the FBI from 2004 through 2017, was arrested in Oregon on Capitol riot-related misdemeanor charges in May 2023.",
      "Wise repeatedly shouted, \u201cKill \u2019em!\u201d as he watched rioters assaulting officers outside the Capitol, according to an FBI agent\u2019s affidavit. Wise clapped his hands and raised his arms \u201din triumph\u201d after he entered the building through the Senate wing door, the affidavit says. He left the building about nine minutes after entering.",
      "Police body camera footage showed Wise berating police officers outside the Capitol and repeatedly shouting, \u201cShame on you!\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m former law enforcement,\" he told them.\" You\u2019re disgusting. You are the Nazi. You are the Gestapo. You can\u2019t see it.\u201d",
      "Wise was on trial in Washington when Trump returned to the White House in January and immediately pardoned, commuted prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of cases for all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the attack. The case against Wise was dismissed before the jury reached a verdict.",

      "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from dismantling a U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C., ruled that Trump violated federal law when he appointed Pete Marocco the new head of the U.S. African Development Foundation, or USDAF, because Marocco was never confirmed by Congress. As a result, Marocco's actions \u2014 terminating most of the agency's employees and effectively ending the agency's grants \u2014 are void and must be undone, the judge found.",
      "Congress created USADF as an independent agency in 1980, and its board members must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In 2023, Congress allocated $46 million to the agency to invest in small agricultural and energy infrastructure projects and other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries.",
      "On Feb. 19, Trump issued an executive order that said USADF, the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Inter-American Foundation and the Presidio Trust should be scaled back to the minimum presence required by law. Trump also fired the agency's board members and installed Marocco as the board chair.",
      "Two USDAF staffers and a consulting firm based in Zambia that works closely with USADF sued on May 21, challenging Marocco's appointment and saying the deep cuts to the agency prevented it from carrying out its congressionally mandated functions.",
      "The staffers and consulting firm asked the judge for a preliminary injunction, saying Marocco's \u201cslash-and-burn approach\u201d threatened to reduce the agency to rubble before their lawsuit is resolved. They said the Federal Vacancies Reform Act prohibited Marocco's appointment to USADF, and that the same law requires that any actions done by an unlawfully appointed person must be unwound.",
      "\u201cThis is a victory for the rule of law and the communities that rely on USADF\u2019s vital work,\u201d said Joel McElvain, senior legal adviser at Democracy Forward, the organization representing the USDAF staffers and consulting firm in their lawsuit. \u201cWe will continue fighting against these power grabs to protect USADF\u2019s ability to fulfill the mission that Congress gave it to perform.\u201d",
      "U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro had written in court documents that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act doesn't apply to USADF, and that the president has the authority to designate acting members of the agency's board until the Senate confirms his nominees. Any claims about the cuts themselves, Pirro said, must be handled in the Court of Federal Claims, not the federal district court.",
      "The judge found in a separate case that Trump had the legal authority to fire the previous members of the USADF board. Pirro wrote in court documents in that case that the president also has the legal authority to appoint someone to run the USADF, consistent with Trump's policy goals, until the Senate could confirm his nominees.",

      "\u201cAlthough we welcome the approval and intent of the settlement, our mission remains to protect the interests of our current student-athletes while honoring UNO\u2019s core values as we transition to a new era,\u201d the university wrote in a statement. \u201cOpting in at this stage ... would simply introduce new and unresolved variables at a time when clarity is critical.\u201d",
      "Omaha cited Title IX compliance as a reason, which according to attorney Mit Winter, a college sports legal expert, should be a legitimate concern for any university opting in and deciding to share up to $20.5 million with its athletes over the next year alone.",
      "\u201cA lot of people think Title IX doesn\u2019t mandate that the rev-share dollars be paid out the same way that athletic scholarships have to be paid out, which is proportional to the male-female student population,\u201d Winter said. \u201cMost (Power Four) schools, 90- to 95% of their $20.5 million are going to go to male athletes \u2014 football and basketball in most cases.\u201d",
      "Another noteworthy opt-out is Montana, whose football team consistently competes at a high level. Athletic director Kent Haslam informed multiple outlets of the university\u2019s decision, which comes as archrival Montana State opts in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been sitting on this extra pot of revenue that now, magically, we\u2019ll be able to share,\u201d Haslam told the Montana Kaimin in April.",
      "Winter said even a year on the sideline could hurt.",
      "\u201cIt makes it much harder to compete in recruiting if schools you\u2019re competing against are able to pay their athletes up to $20.5 million and you\u2019re not able to pay them anything,\u201d Winter said. \u201cIn my view, Montana State just gave themselves a huge advantage in recruiting over Montana.\u201d",
      "For schools opting in \u2013 and that\u2019s the vast majority across Division I -- there is a host of questions. Some are logistical: Many donor-backed collectives are disbanding or being brought in-house, a key change in fundraising. Schools are getting familiar with reporting and enforcement details for NIL deals over $600, and both school and athlete are getting crash courses on contracts that read more like the are from the NFL and other pro sports leagues.",
      "Plenty of opt-ins won\u2019t reach the $20.5 million cap that will rise over the next decade. But regardless of finances, most schools have chosen to partake in the settlement to stay competitive in an evolving college sports landscape.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of schools that feel the obligation to opt in to remain competitive,\" said Michael Rueda, an attorney leads the sports and entertainment division at the Withers law firm. \"I do think it offers a bit more structure for some of those larger schools that have been spending a lot of time trying to build a collective and raise money so that they could keep their best athletes. And then there are other schools that just aren\u2019t in the same category. From a dollars and cents perspective, it just doesn\u2019t make sense across the board.\u201d",
      "With limited resources and difficulties adapting to NIL ventures, Rueda said smaller schools face significant challenges against deep-pocketed universities.",
      "\u201cI would envision that a lot of those schools can\u2019t even fathom how to make this jump yet,\u201d Rueda said. \u201cThey were struggling even before this trying to understand how institutional NIL worked. They probably were just coming to terms with how some of that stuff might have been feasible for them, and now you\u2019re completely changing the game. And so they have to get up to speed and figure out what this looks like for a school of that size with limited resources, budget staff and all that.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for afterschool and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more",
      "WASHINGTON -- Day camp providers and schools are warning that a Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income American families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.",
      "The administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as part of a review to ensure grants align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "The move leaves states and schools in limbo as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year, introducing new uncertainty about when \u2014 or if \u2014 they will receive the money. It also sets the stage for a clash with Democrats, who say the administration is flouting the law by holding back money Congress appropriated.",
      "Without the money, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work, and they may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Even classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy.",
      "For instance, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of the withheld money to run camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If funding isn\u2019t restored soon, the programming may end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \u201cIf these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\u201d Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs that rely on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department did not provide a timeline and warned that \u201cdecisions have not yet been made\u201d on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\u201cThe Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President\u2019s priorities and the Department\u2019s statutory responsibilities,\u201d Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program serving more than 1,200 low-income students if federal funds aren't released. There\u2019s no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\u201cThose hours between after school and 6 o\u2019clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\u201d Browning said. \u201cIt would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\u201d",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Trump\u2019s 2026 budget proposal called for Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressed the administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\u201cEvery day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they\u2019ll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\u201d Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It\u2019s the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800,000 in limbo, while Texas has over $660,000.",
      "\u201cTrump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \u201cThe Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump\u2019s political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \u201cput several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\u201d said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send a message,\u201d said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\u201d",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she\u2019ll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an essential service in our community because we don\u2019t have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\u201d she said.",
      "Sipe said it\u2019s particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\u201cIt feels preventable,\u201d she said, \u201cand it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America\u2019s children.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The sprawling Republican budget bill approved by the Senate Tuesday removes a proposed tax on solar and wind energy projects but quickly phases out tax credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy.",
      "The Senate approved the bill 51-50 as President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers move to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under former President Joe Biden. Vice President JD Vance broke a tie after three Republican senators voted no.",
      "The bill now moves to the House for final legislative approval.",
      "The excise tax on solar and wind generation projects was added to the Senate bill over the weekend, prompting bipartisan pushback from lawmakers as well as clean energy developers and advocates.",
      "The final bill removes the tax but mostly sticks with legislative language released late Friday night and would end incentives for clean energy sooner than a draft version unveiled two weeks ago.",
      "Democrats and environmental groups said the GOP plan would crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans\u2019 utility bills. The measure jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects slated to boost the nation\u2019s electric grid, they said.",
      "\u201cDespite limited improvements, this legislation undermines the very foundation of America\u2019s manufacturing comeback and global energy leadership,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. If the bill becomes law, \u201cfamilies will face higher electric bills, factories will shut down, Americans will lose their jobs, and our electric grid will grow weaker,'' she said.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, the top lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill's passage.",
      "\u201cThis historic legislation will help usher in a new era of energy dominance by unlocking opportunities for investment, opening lease sales and expanding access to oil and natural gas development,'' said Mike Sommers, the group's president and CEO.",
      "While Democrats complained that the bill would make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans said the measure represents historic savings for taxpayers and supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.",
      "In a compromise approved overnight, the bill allows wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law's enactment to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are \u201cplaced in service,'' or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.",
      "The bill retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.",
      "Changes to the renewable energy language \u2014 including removal of the excise tax on wind and solar \u2014 were negotiated by a group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Iowa Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley. Iowa is a top producer of wind power, while Murkowski is a longtime supporter of renewable energy as crucial for achieving energy independence, particularly for isolated rural communities in Alaska.",
      "Murkowski, who voted in favor of the final bill, called her decision-making process \u201cagonizing.\u201d",
      "Changes that push back the timeline for terminating wind and solar credits mean that \u201ca good number\u201d of Alaska projects would still qualify, she said. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s not all we wanted. It could have been worse,\u201d she told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Murkowski praised provisions calling for more oil lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other areas in Alaska and increased revenue sharing.",
      "Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called the bill a \u201cmassively destructive piece of legislation\u201d that \u201cincreases costs for everyone by walloping the health care system, making families go hungry and sending utility bills through the roof.\u201d",
      "The bill \u201csaddles our children and grandchildren with trillions and trillions of dollars in debt \u2014 all to serve giant corporations, fossil fuel polluters and billionaire Republican megadonors who are already among the richest people on the planet,\u201d Whitehouse said.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, hailed the bill for rescinding many elements of what he called the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cgreen new scam,\u201d including electric vehicle tax credits that have allowed car owners to lower the purchase price of EVs by $7,500. The bill also blocks for 10 years a first-ever fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas production. Industry groups fiercely opposed the methane fee, which was authorized by Democrats in the 2022 climate law but never implemented. The GOP bill also increases oil and gas leases on public lands and revives coal leasing in Wyoming and other states.",
      "\u201cToday, the Senate moved President Trump\u2019s agenda forward,'' said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican who chairs the Senate environment committee.",
      "Clean energy advocates were deeply disappointed by the bill, which they argue undoes much of the climate law before it fully takes effect.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating a number of clean energy incentives and slashing others, this bill represents a significant step backward for America\u2019s energy future,\u201d said Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit that seeks to accelerate the global transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cCurtailing incentives for electricity generated from wind and solar power is particularly shortsighted'' and will raise energy prices for households and businesses and threaten reliability of the electric grid, Keohane said.",

      "The Monday ruling from a three judge panel on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals means Michael Sockwell, 62, is eligible for a retrial. He was convicted of killing former Montgomery County Sheriff Isaiah Harris in 1988 when he was 26-years old.",
      "The panel issued a 2-1 opinion stating Alabama prosecutors violated Sockwell's 14th Amendment rights by \u201crepeatedly and purposefully\u201d rejecting potential Black jurors who were believed to be more sympathetic to him on the basis of their shared race.",
      "Prosecutors said Harris' wife hired Sockwell to kill Harris because she wanted to cover up an affair she was having and collect Harris' insurance money. There were no witnesses to the shooting. Sockwell, whose attorneys say has a low IQ that disqualifies him from the death penalty, initially told authorities in a videotaped confession that he killed Harris. At his trial, Sockwell testified that officers threatened to beat and kill him before he confessed and deprived him of food and water.",
      "Sockwell then testified that another man, who was having an affair with Harris' wife, committed the killing. Sockwell also denied he ever received money to kill Harris.",
      "The jury voted 7-5 to sentence Sockwell to life in prison, but the judge overruled the decision and sentenced Sockwell to death. Alabama no longer allows a judge to override a jury\u2019s sentence in capital cases.",
      "Attorneys for Sockwell appealed the decision, arguing the prosecutors unconstitutionally used race as the basis for jury selection, rejecting 80% of the Black jurors who were eligible for Sockwell's trial \u2014 compared to only 20% white jurors who were disqualified. The appeal cited notes from the prosecutor that rejected one juror who she described as \u201ca (B)lack male, approximately twenty-three years of age, which would put him very close to the same race, sex, and age of\u201d Sockwell.",
      "Judge Robert J. Luck, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, dissented. Luck emphasized that the prosecutor noted the race of white potential jurors too, a fact Luck said indicated race was not a disqualifying factor for jurors in Sockwell\u2019s case.",
      "The opinion, written by former President Bill Clinton-appointed Judge Charles Wilson, also cited four other cases in the years leading up to Sockwell's case where the state prosecutor appeared to have illegally rejected Black jurors based solely on their race, demonstrating a \u201cpattern\u201d of choosing juries with \u201cdiscriminatory intent.\u201d",
      "The Alabama Attorney General's Office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment Tuesday morning.",

      "Florida law enforcement agencies' cooperation with federal immigration officials is causing concerns among family members and immigrants' rights advocates that people will disappear into county jail systems",
      "MIAMI -- As Florida law enforcement agencies work with federal immigration officials, family members and immigrants' rights advocates worry that people will disappear into county jail systems despite the state's expansive public record laws.",
      "Miami-Dade officials said during a Thursday commission meeting that they are committed to transparency and will continue to follow state laws regarding the release of information about inmates. But one section of an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement designates all records and information created under the agreement as federal records, and some observers say ICE would have the final say on what information is made public, including whether a person is even in custody.",
      "That could be a huge problem, said William Mann, an attorney with the Community Justice Project.",
      "\u201cI think the concerns that many folks have would be that they (county officials) would use this language that\u2019s in this basic ordering agreement ... to prevent loved ones, family members, friends, advocates and journalists from accessing information,\u201d Mann said. \u201cMeaning that they would disappear into the Miami-Dade system if they were technically an ICE prisoner.\u201d",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary of ICE, told the Associated Press via email that any allegations that detainees do not have due process are false.",
      "\u201cFurther, all detainees are provided ample opportunity to communicate with their attorneys and family members,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "She said the easiest way to locate someone in custody is through the ICE detainee locator.",
      "Under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, local and state officials must take a much more aggressive role in supporting federal immigration enforcement, which has ramped up since President Donald Trump\u2019s return to office in January.",
      "A law 2022 law expanded the state's ban on so-called sanctuary policies and required agencies that operate county detention facilities to enter into agreements with ICE that empower local officers to identify and process \u201cremovable aliens\u201d in their jails.",
      "Another measure signed into law this year requires officials responsible for overseeing local or state law enforcement to use their \u201cbest efforts\u201d to support federal immigration enforcement. Upon the request of a federal agency, county detention centers are also required to provide a list of \u201call inmates\u201d and \u201cany information\u201d about each one's immigration status.",
      "\u201cToday, the Florida Legislature has passed the strongest legislation to combat illegal immigration of any state in the entire country,\u201d DeSantis said earlier this year. \u201cWe are ahead of the curve on ending the illegal immigration crisis.\u201d",
      "Local elected officials who initially balked at signing cooperation agreements with ICE have been threatened by the state attorney general with removal from office.",
      "At Thursday's Miami-Dade commission meeting, the board was scheduled to vote on new provisions for the county's existing ICE agreement but ultimately deferred and chose to let Mayor Daniella Levine Cava ratify the deal herself.",
      "Levine Cava told people who attended the hearing that she had no choice in the matter: \u201cThis is the law of Florida, and it was required that this agreement be signed.\u201d",
      "She and several commissioners noted that any public records the county has jurisdiction over would continue to be publicly available.",
      "While officials in Miami-Dade have said they are committed to transparency, federal inmates, including people on immigration holds, had not been appearing in Orange County jail records until just last week.",
      "Ericka G\u00f3mez-Tejeda, organizing director for Hope Community Center, said officials in the central Florida county took the position that the federal records were not covered by state open records laws, meaning immigrants were effectively disappearing into the system.",
      "G\u00f3mez-Tejeda pointed to the case of Esvin Juarez, who was arrested and deported to Guatemala this month before his family and attorney even knew where he was being held. Making it difficult to track detained immigrants is intentional, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working to the advantage of people\u2019s due process being violated,\u201d G\u00f3mez-Tejeda said.",
      "Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings directed the jail to begin posting information about ICE detainees last week, but G\u00f3mez-Tejeda said that might not help inmates were arrested in other counties or states before being taken to Orange County.",
      "\u201cWe have people who have been sent to four or five different detention centers,\u201d G\u00f3mez-Tejeda said. \u201cAnd each state that you go into, that family then needs to identify an attorney that will then do their representation and their paperwork. So it puts an onerous responsibility on the families.\u201d",
      "U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat who represents the Orlando area, introduced legislation this month aimed at stopping unlawful detention and ending detainee mistreatment. It would require all ICE facilities to publicly report who is being detained, as well as where, when and why.",
      "\u201cThis bill won\u2019t fix everything, but if Donald Trump and his allies think these policies are defensible, then they shouldn\u2019t be afraid to tell the public exactly what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Frost said. \u201cIf they\u2019re proud of it, they\u2019ll report it. If they\u2019re ashamed, they need to end it.\u201d",

      "Two Chinese nationals have been charged with spying inside the United States on behalf of Beijing, including by taking photographs of a naval base and by participating in efforts to recruit members of the military who they thought might be open to work...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two Chinese nationals have been charged with spying inside the United States on behalf of Beijing, including by taking photographs of a naval base, coordinating a cash dead-drop and participating in efforts to recruit members of the military who they thought might be open to working for Chinese intelligence.",
      "The case, filed in federal court in San Francisco and unsealed Monday, is the latest Justice Department prosecution to target what officials say are persistent efforts by the Chinese government to secretly collect intelligence about American military capabilities \u2014 a practice laid bare in startling fashion two years ago with China's launching of a surveillance balloon that U.S. officials ultimately shot down over the coast of South Carolina.",
      "\"This case underscores the Chinese government\u2019s sustained and aggressive effort to infiltrate our military and undermine our national security from within,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement announcing the case. \u201cThe Justice Department will not stand by while hostile nations embed spies in our country \u2013 we will expose foreign operatives, hold their agents to account, and protect the American people from covert threats to our national security.\u201d",
      "Officials identified the defendants as Yuance Chen, 38, who arrived in the U.S. on a visa in 2015 and later became a lawful permanent resident, and Liren \u201cRyan\u201d Lai, 39, who prosecutors say lives in China but traveled to Texas this past spring and was part of an effort to supervise clandestine espionage operations on behalf of China's Ministry of State Security or MSS.",
      "The two were arrested on charges of secretly doing China's bidding without registering as foreign agents with the Justice Department, as required by law. It was not immediately clear if they had lawyers. Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said he had no information about the specific case but asserted that allegations against China \u201chave no facts or evidence\u201d and that \u201cthe U.S. has never stopped its espionage activities against China.\u201d",
      "According to an FBI affidavit filed in connection with the case, investigators believe Lai had been developing Chen to be a Chinese intelligence asset since at least mid-2021.",
      "Their activities, the FBI says, included coordinating on a dead-drop of at least $10,000 in cash to another person who was operating at the direction of the MSS. They also participated and arranged surveillance of a Navy recruiting station in California and Navy base in Washington state, including through photographs that Chen is accused of taking and that investigators believe were transmitted to Chinese intelligence.",
      "Authorities say Lai and Chen also discussed recruiting Navy employees to work for China, with Chen at one point obtaining names, hometowns and programs of recent recruits. Many listed China as their hometown and investigators believe the information was sent to China, the FBI affidavit says.",
      "The affidavit recounts conversations aimed at assessing whether individual Navy employees would make for good recruits for Chinese intelligence.",
      "In one instance, the FBI said, Chen sent Lai the name of a Navy employee and wrote: \u201cI found out. His mother is Chinese. His father and mother did not get along and the mother was given custody when he was 8 years old. That is why he uses his mother's last name.\u201d",
      "The case is one in a series concerning Chinese intelligence-gathering, sometimes related to the U.S. military.",
      "In August 2023, for instance, two Navy sailors were charged with providing sensitive military information to China, including details on wartime exercises, naval operations and critical technical material.",
      "\"Adverse foreign intelligence services like the PRC\u2019s Ministry of State Security dedicate years to recruiting individuals and cultivating them as intelligence assets to do their bidding within the United States,\u201d Assistant Attorney General John Eisenberg, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said in a statement.",

      "Jabari Peoples, 18, was shot June 23 by a police officer in the parking lot of a soccer field in Homewood, an affluent suburb near the central city of Birmingham.",
      "The Homewood Police Department said the officer fired his weapon after Peoples grabbed a gun from a car door during a scuffle as the officer was trying to arrest him for marijuana possession.",
      "The family is disputing the police version of events. Leroy Maxwell, Jr., an attorney representing the family, said Peoples was shot in the back and, according to a witness, did not have a weapon when approached by the officer.",
      "Hundreds of people attended a vigil for Peoples at the soccer complex where he was shot. The family released doves and white balloons and brought in a large photo of Peoples with angel wings. Candles spelled out \u2018Jabari\u2019 at the spot where he was killed.",
      "Bron Peoples said his younger brother had a plan for his life and would write down his dreams for the future in a notebook. He said their parents had drilled into them how to behave when interacting with police. He said the family is \u201ccalling for justice.\u201d",

      "The shooting unfolded at about 9:30 p.m. when a police officer approached a car at the Homewood Soccer Complex where Peoples and a female friend were parked.",
      "The Homewood Police Department posted a statement on social media that the officer smelled marijuana and noticed a handgun in the pocket of the driver\u2019s side door. The officer attempted to put Peoples in handcuffs to arrest him for marijuana possession and a struggle ensued, according to the statement.",
      "\u201cPeoples broke away from the officer and retrieved the handgun from the open driver\u2019s side door pocket, creating an immediate deadly threat to the officer. The officer, fearing for his safety, fired one round from his service weapon to defend himself,\u201d the police statement said.",

      "Jimmy Swaggart, the televangelist whose multimillion-dollar ministry was crippled by his encounters with prostitutes, has died",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who became a household name amassing an enormous following and multimillion-dollar ministry only to be undone by his penchant for prostitutes, has died.",
      "Swaggart died decades after his once vast audience dwindled and his name became a punchline on late night television. His death was announced Tuesday on his public Facebook page. A cause wasn't immediately given, though at 90 he had been in poor health.",
      "The Louisiana native was best known for being a captivating Pentecostal preacher with a massive following before being caught on camera with a prostitute in New Orleans in 1988, one of a string of successful TV preachers brought down in the 1980s and \u201990s by sex scandals. He continued preaching for decades, but with a reduced audience.",
      "Swaggart encapsulated his downfall in a tearful 1988 sermon, in which he wept and apologized but made no reference to his connection to a prostitute.",
      "\u201cI have sinned against you,\u201d Swaggart told parishioners nationwide. \u201cI beg you to forgive me.\u201d",
      "He announced his resignation from the Assemblies of God later that year, shortly after the church said it was defrocking him for rejecting punishment it had ordered for \u201cmoral failure.\u201d The church had wanted him to undergo a two-year rehabilitation program, including not preaching for a full year.",
      "Swaggart said at the time that he knew dismissal was inevitable but insisted he had no choice but to separate from the church to save his ministry and Bible college.",
      "Swaggart grew up poor, the son of a preacher, in a music-rich family. He excelled at piano and gospel music, playing and singing with talented cousins who took different paths: rock-'n'-roller Jerry Lee Lewis and country singer Mickey Gilley.",
      "In his hometown of Ferriday, Louisiana, Swaggart said he first heard the call of God at age 8. The voice gave him goose bumps and made his hair tingle, he said.",
      "\u201cEverything seemed different after that day in front of the Arcade Theater,\u201d he said in a 1985 interview with the Jacksonville Journal-Courier in Illinois. \u201cI felt better inside. Almost like taking a bath.\u201d",
      "He preached and worked part time in oil fields until he was 23. He then moved entirely into his ministry: preaching, playing piano and singing gospel songs with the barrelhouse fervor of cousin Lewis at Assemblies of God revivals and camp meetings.",
      "Swaggart started a radio show, a magazine, and then moved into television, with outspoken views.",
      "He called Roman Catholicism \u201ca false religion. It is not the Christian way,\u201d and claimed that Jews suffered for thousands of years \u201cbecause of their rejection of Christ.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don't like what I say, talk to my boss,\u201d he once shouted as he strode in front of his congregation at his Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, where his sermons moved listeners to speak in tongues and stand up as if possessed by the Holy Spirit.",
      "Swaggart's messages stirred thousands of congregants and millions of TV viewers, making him a household name by the late 1980s. Contributors built Jimmy Swaggart Ministries into a business that made an estimated $142 million in 1986.",
      "His Baton Rouge complex still includes a worship center and broadcasting and recording facilities.",
      "Swaggart\u2019s downfall came in the late 1980s as other prominent preachers faced similar scandals. Swaggart said publicly that his earnings were hurt in 1987 by the sex scandal surrounding rival televangelist Jim Bakker and a former church secretary at Bakker's PTL ministry organization.",
      "The following year, Swaggart was photographed at a hotel with Debra Murphree, an admitted prostitute who told reporters that the two did not have sex but that the preacher had paid her to pose nude.",
      "She later repeated the claim \u2014 and posed nude \u2014 for Penthouse magazine.",
      "The surveillance photos that crippled Swaggart's career apparently stemmed from his rivalry with preacher Marvin Gorman, whom Swaggart had accused of sexual misdeeds. Gorman hired the photographer who captured Swaggart and Murphree on film. Swaggart later paid Gorman $1.8 million to settle a lawsuit over the sexual allegations against Gorman.",
      "More trouble came in 1991, when police in California detained Swaggart with another prostitute. The evangelist was charged with driving on the wrong side of the road and driving an unregistered Jaguar. His companion, Rosemary Garcia, said Swaggart became nervous when he saw the police car and weaved when he tried to stuff pornographic magazines under a car seat.",
      "Swaggart was later mocked by the late TV comic Phil Hartman, who impersonated him on NBC's \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "The evangelist largely stayed out of the news in later years but remained in the pulpit at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, often joined by his son, Donnie, a fellow preacher. His radio station broadcast church services and gospel music to 21 states, and Swaggart\u2019s ministry boasted a worldwide audience on the internet.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been no greater example of a good and faithful servant than my father. No ifs, ands and buts about it. A man who lived his life for the cause of Christ,\u201d Donnie Swaggart said in a video message shared on social media Sunday about his dad\u2019s final days.",
      "The preacher caused another brief stir in 2004 with remarks about being \u201clooked at\u201d amorously by a gay man.",
      "\u201cAnd I'm going to be blunt and plain: If one ever looks at me like that, I'm going to kill him and tell God he died,\u201d Jimmy Swaggart said, to laughter from the congregation. He later apologized.",
      "Swaggart made few public appearances outside his church, save for singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d at the 2005 funeral of Louisiana Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, a prominent name in state politics for decades.",
      "In 2022, he shared memories at the memorial service for Lewis, his cousin and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll pioneer. The pair had released \u201cThe Boys From Ferriday,\u201d a gospel album, earlier that year.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s comments about evidence the Justice Department is reviewing from its Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation have fueled anticipation about the expected release of more files related to the New York financier",
      "WASHINGTON -- It was a surprising statement from Attorney General Pam Bondi as the Trump administration promises to release more files from its sex trafficking investigation of Jeffrey Epstein: The FBI, she said, was reviewing \u201ctens of thousands of videos\u201d of the wealthy financier \u201cwith children or child porn.\u201d",
      "The comment, made to reporters at the White House days after a similar remark to a stranger with a hidden camera, raised the stakes for President Donald Trump's administration to prove it has in its possession previously unseen compelling evidence. That task is all the more pressing after an earlier document dump that Bondi hyped angered elements of Trump\u2019s base by failing to deliver new bombshells and as administration officials who had promised to unlock supposed secrets of the so-called government \u201cdeep state\" struggle to fulfill that pledge.",
      "Yet weeks after Bondi\u2019s remarks, it remains unclear what she was referring to.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with people involved as lawyers or law enforcement officials in criminal cases of Epstein and socialite former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell who said they hadn't seen and didn't know of a trove of recordings like what Bondi described. Indictments and detention memos do not reference the existence of videos of Epstein with children, and neither was charged with possession of child sex abuse material even though that offense would have been much easier to prove than the sex trafficking counts they faced.",
      "One potential clue may lie in a little-noticed 2023 court filing \u2014 among hundreds of documents reviewed by the AP \u2014 in which Epstein\u2019s estate was revealed to have located an unspecified number of videos and photos that it said might contain child sex abuse material. But even that remains shrouded in secrecy with lawyers involved in that civil case saying a protective order prevents them from discussing it.",
      "The filing suggests a discovery of recordings after the criminal cases had concluded, but if that's what Bondi was referencing, the Justice Department has not said.",
      "The department declined repeated requests from the AP to speak with officials overseeing the Epstein review. Spokespeople did not answer a list of questions about Bondi\u2019s comments, including when and where the recordings were procured, what they depict and whether they were newly discovered as authorities dug through their evidence collection or were known for some time to have been in the government's possession.",
      "\u201cOutside sources who make assertions about materials included in the DOJ\u2019s review cannot speak to what materials are included in the DOJ\u2019s review,\u201d spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said in a statement.",
      "Epstein\u2019s crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a coverup. Elon Musk entered the frenzy during his acrimonious fallout with Trump when he said without evidence in a since-deleted social media post that the reason the Epstein files have yet to be released is that the Republican president is featured in them.",
      "During a Fox News Channel interview in February, Bondi suggested an alleged Epstein \u201cclient list\u201d was sitting on her desk. The next day, the Justice Department distributed binders marked \u201cdeclassified\u201d to far-right influencers at the White House, but it quickly became clear much of the information had long been in the public domain. No \u201cclient list\u201d was disclosed, and there\u2019s no evidence such a document exists.",
      "The flop left conservatives fuming and failed to extinguish conspiracy theories that for years have spiraled around Epstein's case. Right wing-personality Laura Loomer called on Bondi to resign, branding her a \u201ctotal liar.\"",
      "Afterward, Bondi said an FBI \u201csource\u201d informed her of the existence of thousands of pages of previously undisclosed documents and ordered the bureau to provide the \u201cfull and complete Epstein files,\" including any videos. Employees since then have logged hours reviewing records to prepare them for release. It\u2019s unclear when that might happen.",
      "In April, Bondi was approached in a restaurant by a woman with a hidden camera who asked about the status of the Epstein files release. Bondi replied that there were tens of thousands of videos \u201cand it\u2019s all with little kids,\" so she said the FBI had to go through each one.",
      "After conservative activist James O\u2019Keefe, who obtained and later publicized the hidden-camera video, alerted the Justice Department to the encounter, Bondi told reporters at the White House: \u201cThere are tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn.\u201d",
      "The comments tapped into long-held suspicions that, despite the release over the years of thousands of records documenting Epstein\u2019s activities, damaging details about him or other prominent figures remain concealed.",
      "The situation was further muddied by recent comments from FBI Director Kash Patel to podcaster Joe Rogan that did not repeat Bondi's account about tens of thousands of videos.",
      "Though not asked explicitly about Bondi, Patel dismissed the possibility of incriminating videos of powerful Epstein friends, saying, \u201cIf there was a video of some guy or gal committing felonies on an island and I\u2019m in charge, don\u2019t you think you\u2019d see it?\u201d Asked whether the narrative \u201cmight not be accurate that there\u2019s video of these guys doing this,\u201d he replied, \u201cExactly.\u201d",
      "Epstein\u2019s suicide in August 2019, weeks after his arrest, prevented a trial in New York and cut short the discovery process in which evidence is shared among lawyers.",
      "But even in a subsequent prosecution of Maxwell, in which such evidence would presumably have been relevant given the nature of the accusations against an alleged co-conspirator, salacious videos of Epstein with children never surfaced nor were part of the case, said one of her lawyers.",
      "\u201cWe were never provided with any of those materials. I suspect if they existed, we would have seen them, and I\u2019ve never seen them, so I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about,\u201d said Jeffrey Pagliuca, who represented Maxwell in a 2021 trial in which she was convicted of luring teenage girls to be molested by Epstein.",
      "To be sure, photographs of nude or seminude girls have long been known to be part of the case. Investigators recovered possibly thousands of such pictures while searching his Manhattan mansion, and a videorecorded walk-through by law enforcement of his Palm Beach, Florida, home revealed sexually suggestive photographs displayed inside, court records show.",
      "Accounts from more than one accuser of feeling watched or seeing cameras or surveillance equipment in Epstein's properties have contributed to public expectations of sexual recordings. A 2020 Justice Department Office of Professional Responsibility report on the handling of an earlier Epstein investigation hinted at that possibility, saying police who searched his Palm Beach home in 2005 found computer keyboards, monitors and disconnected surveillance cameras, but the equipment \u2014 including video recordings and other electronic items \u2014 was missing.",
      "There's no indication prosecutors obtained any missing equipment during the later federal investigation, and the indictment against him included no recording allegations.",
      "An AP review of hundreds of documents in the Maxwell and Epstein criminal cases identified no reference to tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with underage girls.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t recall personally ever having that kind of discussion,\u201d said one Epstein lawyer, Marc Fernich, who couldn't rule out such evidence wasn't located later. \u201cIt's not something I ever heard about.\u201d",
      "In one non-specific reference to video evidence, prosecutors said in a 2020 filing that they would produce to Maxwell\u2019s lawyers thousands of images and videos from Epstein\u2019s electronic devices in response to a warrant.",
      "But Pagliuca said his recollection was those videos consisted largely of recordings in which Epstein was \u201cmusing\u201d into a recording device \u2014 \u201cEpstein talking to Epstein,\u201d he said.",
      "Complicating efforts to assess the Epstein evidence is the volume of accusers, court cases and districts where legal wrangling has occurred, including after Epstein's suicide and Maxwell's conviction.",
      "The cases include 2022 lawsuits in Manhattan's federal court from an accuser identified as Jane Doe 1 and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein had a home, alleging that financial services giant JPMorgan Chase failed to heed red flags about him being a \u201chigh-risk\u201d customer.",
      "Lawyers issued a subpoena for any video recordings or photos that could bolster their case.",
      "They told a judge months later the Epstein estate had alerted them that it had found content that \u201cmight contain child sex abuse imagery\" while responding to the subpoena and requested a protocol for handling \"videorecorded material and photographs.\" The judge ordered representatives of Epstein\u2019s estate to review the materials before producing them to lawyers and to alert the FBI to possible child sexual abuse imagery.",
      "Court filings don't detail the evidence or say how many videos or images were found, and it's unclear whether the recordings Bondi referenced were the same ones.",
      "The estate's disclosure was later included by a plaintiffs' lawyer, Jennifer Freeman, in a complaint to the FBI and the Justice Department asserting that investigators had failed over the years to adequately collect potential evidence of child sex abuse material.",
      "Freeman cited Bondi's comments in a new lawsuit on behalf of an Epstein accuser who alleges he assaulted her in 1996. In an interview, Freeman said she had not seen recordings and had no direct knowledge but wanted to understand what Bondi meant.",
      "\u201cI want to know what she's addressing, what is she talking about \u2014 I'd like to know that,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 17:33:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The partial verdict in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial came on the second day of deliberations. The jury will return to deliberate on the final count Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial in New York City said it reached a partial verdict in the case, but the judge told them they need to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "The jurors sent a note to the judge late Tuesday afternoon saying they'd reached a verdict on four of the five counts but were unable to agree on count 1, racketeering conspiracy. The note indicated there are jurors with unpersuadable opinions on that charge.",
      "After discussing the options with attorneys for both sides, Judge Arun Subramanian asked the jury to keep deliberating on the remaining charge, which is what prosecutors and defense attorneys asked for.",
      "Court then ended for the day. The jury will return to continue deliberations at 9 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "After the note from the jury was brought to court, Combs was seated with his attorneys surrounding him standing in a half-circle. Combs appeared to be praying with his head bowed and hands folded on his lap. Combs wiped and rubbed his eyes, but it wasn't clear if he was crying.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday.",
      "What are the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "A sweeping grand jury indictment against Combs, 55, was unsealed in September 2024, initially charging the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at an upscale midtown Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges against Combs in a superseding indictment, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "The charges against Combs are one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs pleaded not guilty to the charges. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs' attorneys didn't call him or any witnesses to testify in his defense during the trial. Combs told Judge Subramanian that he decided not to testify, saying: \"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it.\" His lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Combs, and the defense sought an acquittal after the prosecution rested.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" and \"hotel nights\"",
      "The high-profile trial started in May. The proceedings included graphic and emotional testimony, including from singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' former girlfriend who spent more than a decade with him.",
      "Ventura testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura said in court that Combs directed all the encounters, which could last for days. She said Combs would decide who participated, what she could wear and the role she was expected to play. She testified that she felt forced to participate in the \"freak-offs\" to make Combs happy.",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual, and during cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Last year, CNN aired surveillance video from 2016 showing what appears to be Combs assaulting Ventura at a California hotel. Combs apologized at the time, and said his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and he takes \"full responsibility\" for his actions. Ventura testified during the trial that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly settled with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Singer Dawn Richard, who was part of two bands tied to Combs, testified that she often saw Combs being violent toward Ventura. She said that after one incident in 2009, Combs allegedly threatened her and a bandmate, saying they could go missing if they didn't stay quiet.",
      "The defense focused on inconsistencies in Richard's testimony, and she said it takes time to remember things she tried to forget. Separately, Richard has made allegations against Combs in a civil lawsuit, accusing him of physical and psychological abuse, which he has denied.",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym Jane in court. During their relationship between 2021 and 2024, she told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched.",
      "She said she told Combs she didn't like the \"hotel nights.\" Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting them up. Jane said she felt pressured to meet her partner's expectations and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "Jane said she got into a fight with Combs last year over another woman. She said she slammed his head on a marble table and he allegedly grabbed her by the neck, punched and kicked her.",
      "Jericka  Duncan, \n                                                  \n                                  Alice  Gainer and \n                                                  \n                      The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial wanted to review some of the testimony from the hip-hop mogul's former longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura during the second day of deliberations Tuesday.",
      "The panel of eight men and four women continued deliberating the charges against Combs after not reaching a verdict on the first day of deliberations.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian began the day by addressing with the prosecution and defense a question posed Monday from the jury about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 which relates to the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The jury sent a note asking for clarification on the part of the instructions addressing drug distribution.",
      "Subramanian said he would remind jurors of the instructions he gave them on that part of the case before they started deliberating on Monday. Combs' lawyers had pushed for a more expansive response, but prosecutors argued \u2014 and Subramanian agreed \u2014 that doing so could end up confusing jurors more.",
      "An exchange between Subramanian and Combs' defense team got a little testy as they wrangled over the response.",
      "\"Can you do what I'm asking or no?\" the judge asked.",
      "\"Of course I can do what your honor is asking,\" one of the defense lawyers responded.",
      "About 75 minutes into Tuesday's deliberations, the jury requested the testimony from Ventura, one of the prosecution's most important witnesses, when she gave her account of Combs allegedly beating, kicking and dragging her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 \u2014 an assault captured on now-infamous security camera footage. Combs apologized after the video surfaced.",
      "The jury also asked to see Ventura's testimony about an incident in which she said Combs accused her of taking drugs from him and kicked her off of their yacht at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2013. On their way back to the U.S., she said, he threatened to release explicit videos of her having sex.",
      "In addition, the jury asked for Ventura and stripper Daniel Phillip's testimony about her jumping into his lap at a New York City hotel after, as Phillip testified, he suspected Combs had been slapping and slamming her around an adjacent room.",
      "\"Her whole entire body was shaking, like she was terrified,\" said Phillip, who was at the hotel for a sexual encounter with Ventura sometime between 2012 and 2014.",
      "Phillip testified that he asked Ventura why she was with Combs if he was hitting her and beating her. He said he told her she was in real danger. Ventura, he said, \"basically tried to convince me that it was OK, it's OK. I'm fine, I'll be OK.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0federal charges\u00a0of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking, and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "The first day of deliberations saw several notes from the jury, as well as Combs and his supporters bowing their heads in prayer in the courtroom. One of the notes came not long after jurors started deliberating and raised concerns from several jurors about another member of the panel. They told the judge they thought \"he cannot follow your honor's instructions.\"",
      "After a discussion between the judge, attorneys for Combs and prosecutors, the judge reminded the jurors of their obligation to follow the law and sent them back to resume their deliberations, but said if more issues should arise, the foreperson should send another note.",
      "To help them come to a verdict, jurors were provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",

    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking case in New York shared concerns about an individual juror with the judge not long after they started deliberating Monday. The first day of deliberations ultimately ended without a verdict.",
      "After more than two hours of legal instructions from federal Judge Arun Subramanian, the jury of eight men and four women headed behind closed doors to deliberate at around 11:30 a.m. Subramanian told the five alternate jurors to remain on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury who are weighing charges that could put the hip-hop mogul in prison for life.",
      "About 10 minutes into deliberations, the jury sent a note indicating they'd completed their first order of business: electing a foreperson.",
      "Less than two hours later, at about 1:25 p.m., a note from the jury was read in court  to inform the judge of concerns regarding one juror's ability to follow the instructions. The jury asked the judge to question this juror. The judge discussed the response with the prosecution and defense and decided to remind the jury of their obligation to follow the law and resume their deliberations.",
      "After the judge originally proposed asking the jury foreperson the nature of concerns about the fellow juror, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested caution and that less be said rather than more.",
      "\"We can always ratchet it up. We can't ratchet it down,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the late afternoon, the jury sent the judge a new note with a question about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 stemming from the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The judge told the court he'd answer them on Tuesday and dismissed the jury for the day.",
      "Jurors are being provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Subramanian had stressed to the jury the importance of delivering a unanimous verdict, but also said no juror should surrender their beliefs in order to reach unanimity.",
      "Ahead of the deliberations, CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, discussed on \"CBS Mornings\" what judges typically tell juries.",
      "\"The judge will instruct the jurors, 'maintain your own integrity with respect to what you believe, but keep an open mind, engage in discussions with other jurors, look at the evidence, see other people's point of view, and if you can with integrity really come over to, you know, the other side, then you can get to unanimity,'\" Polisi said.",
      "As the deliberations got underway, Combs faced his family and supporters in the courtroom gallery. They bowed their heads in prayer \u2014 his family members holding hands with each other. When they finished, they all applauded.",
      "The judge granted Combs' request to have some books with him during the deliberations. On his way out of the courtroom on Monday, Combs showed two books to reporters: \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" and \"The Happiness Advantage.\"",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "Polisi said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",
      "She said that he used his \"close inner circle and a small army of personal staff, who made it their mission to meet the defendant's every desire, promote his power and protect his reputation at all costs.\"",
      "Agnifilo countered, \"This isn't about crime. It's about money.\" He noted that one of Combs' accusers in the criminal case also sued him in civil court.",
      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Jurors also saw now-infamous security camera video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 and clips from videos of sexual encounters.",
      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

      "The taxpayer-funded BBC said in a statement Monday that it regrets not cutting short its live streaming signal after punk-rap duo Bob Vylan started leading a chant of \"Death, death to the IDF,\" during their Saturday performance, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "\"The BBC respects freedom of expression but stands firmly against incitement to violence,\" the statement\u00a0from the broadcaster said. \"The antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves... The [BBC broadcasting] team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.\"",
      "The BBC, which is CBS News' partner network in the U.K., quickly acknowledged that the language used on Saturday was \"deeply offensive,\" but the network was criticized \u2014 including by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and members of his cabinet \u2014\u2014 for not reacting more quickly after the chant started.",
      "Glastonbury festival's organizers also condemned the chant in a statement, saying: \"Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\"",
      "The reaction from the Trump administration appeared to be significantly harsher, with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau saying in a social media post on Monday that U.S. entry visas already issued to Bob Vylan's members had been revoked \"in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\"",
      "The band's website shows more than a dozen scheduled tour dates in the U.S., from coast to coast, starting in late October.",
      "\"Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\" Landau said in the post.",
      "On Sunday, Bob Vylan posted a lengthy statement on their Instagram\u00a0page, with the caption: \"I said what I said.\"",
      "The duo, who use stage names and keep their identities anonymous, said their message was aimed at younger generations, whom they said should be shown how to fight for their own futures.",
      "\"Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change,\" the band said. \"Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organizing online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.\"",
      "Local police have launched an investigation into the chants to determine whether any criminal offenses may have been committed.",
      "Glastonbury is a five-day music festival that takes place on a farm in the southwest of England. It is one of the largest music festivals anywhere in the world, drawing more than 200,000 ticketholders, and it generally takes place every other year as the organizers give the farm fields time to recover from the impact of so many revelers. The event is hosted and organized by the Eavis family, who still own the farm, and has been running for about 55 years.",
      "Bob Vylan's performance preceded that of Northern Irish rappers Kneecap, whose set the BBC did not air live due to previous instances at the group's concerts involving alleged comments supporting Hamas and Hezbollah and calling for the death of Conservative party lawmakers.",
      "Kneecap's members have insisted that they \"do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah.\"",
      "They sent \"heartfelt apologies\" to the families of two British lawmakers who were murdered in recent years after their remarks about Conservative parliamentarians.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The fighter for Truth, Justice and the American Way is back on the big screen. Director James Gunn talks about his re-imagining of the Man of Steel, and actor David Corenswet discusses the challenges of taking on the iconic role.",
    "story": [
      "He was born on the planet Krypton. But the Man of Steel comes to life in California, inside an edit room in Burbank. It's there that James Gunn is reviewing a scene from what Warner Brothers hopes is a summer blockbuster: \"Superman.\" With a reported budget of at least $225 million, it arrives in theaters July 11.",
      "It's the first feature from DC Studios, a division of Warner Brothers.\u00a0 Gunn is not only the film's director; he wrote the screenplay, and he's DC's CEO.",
      "\"I feel good about the movie,\" he said. \"And I'm excited about that. And I think we've done something that's different.\"",
      "Among those differences: \"My Superman is not indestructible,\" Gunn said. \"We see him bleed, immediately. At times, I've thought, 'He's too strong.' You don't want him to be able to punch a planet in half or, for that matter, go around a planet a billion times and make time go backwards, you know? I wanted a Superman who was a little bit more down-to-Earth.\"",
      "And few things are more down-to-Earth than a dog. \"The dog is the whole reason \u2013 [it] was the start of the movie for me, a thousand percent,\" Gunn said. \"I adopted a dog. His name is Ozu. And he didn't want to be touched, he had never known human beings. He chewed up all our furniture. He was, you know, chasing the cat, and just being the worst dog you can imagine. And I thought, 'Wow. What if this terrible dog had super powers? I'd really be screwed!'\"",
      "The first Superman feature film came in 1951 with George Reeves, who later played the role on TV. In this century, Superman has been played by Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill. But in the last 75 years, only one big screen Superman has fully captured the audience's imagination: Christopher Reeve.",
      "Trained in the theater, Reeve was a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York \u2013 as is the new Superman, David Corenswet. He is 31 \u2013 seven years older than Reeve was when he made his debut in 1978. \"I don't think there's any way or reason to try to sort of live up to Christopher Reeve,\" Corenswet said. \"I just feel grateful to get to play that character that he embodied and put into the public consciousness in such a positive and strong way.\"",
      "We met Corenswet at the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia. It's Corenswet's hometown, where he still lives, and it's at the Arden where he landed his first paid gig, when he was nine years old: \"All My Sons\" by Arthur Miller.",
      "Like his Superman, Corenswet is immediately disarming, as well as vulnerable, as in a scene with Superman's girlfriend, reporter Lois Lane (played by Rachel Brosnahan).",
      "\"He is definitively different from everybody else on Earth,\" Corenswet said. \"He is not human. He's an alien, and he has these powers that nobody else has. And at the same time, he wants desperately to be a part of humanity. So ultimately, the dramatic stakes of Superman as a character is that he is lonely and he doesn't want to be.\"",
      "He also has a sense of humor about those red shorts. \"Without the trunks, the uniform can look very military,\" Corenswet said. \"So he puts the red underwear on, a) so that everybody can see him, against the blue sky you can see the red trunks, b) so that everybody knows he doesn't take himself too seriously. He's not trying to look cool.",
      "\"Now, that doesn't in any way undermine how badass and cool he is when he's up in the sky fighting the bad guys. But once he touches down, he wants to be the one that people can laugh or make fun of, because he can take it.\"",
      "Superman has been saving the world for nearly nine decades. Created by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster, he first appeared in a comic in 1938.",
      "Asked if Superman represents the signature American movie character, critic and filmmaker Elvis Mitchell said, \"I think he's bigger than that. Spider-Man is tortured. You know, he has to support himself and his aunt, and he's responsible for the death of his uncle. And Batman's responsible for the death of everybody in his line of sight. They're all sufferers.",
      "\"But Superman, he stands tall, and there's a pride of authorship, literally, in the character. 'Cause he's creating his own narrative as his alter ego. People want to see that. They want to believe that you can create your own narrative in a way that is benevolent, even if you have all the power in the world. It's wrong of you to turn away from people who need your help.\"",
      "Asked what he wants audiences around the world to take away from his Superman, Gunn said, \"I think, just culturally, being able to place a little bit more importance on being a good human being. I think we're surrounded by a lot of meanness. I think Superman is surrounded by a lot of meanness in the movie. But he stands against that grain. And that's what makes him rebellious.",
      "\"And in a way, I think today, in today's world, Superman's the edgier, more rebellious character because he's the one who's standing up for the values that most people are not,\" he said.",
      "Corenswet is embracing the challenge, fully aware that success could mean Superman defines his career. He said, \"When you take a role that's gonna be this visible and this iconic, even just visually iconic, and it's your face and the underwear, yeah, I wanted to be prepared for the possibility that it wouldn't lead to a bunch of other things, that this would be the thing.",
      "\"And I felt really lucky that when I asked myself that question the answer came back, somebody's gotta play this part, and if you're the person to play it and you give up everything else to do it, it would be worth doing.\"",

      "Attorney Marc Agnifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began his four-hour presentation Friday in a New York courtroom.",
      "\"Way to go, fellas,\" he said of the agents.",
      "He said prosecutors had \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes to combine it with recreational drug use and call it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Agnifilo said of Combs: \"He sits there innocent. Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.\"",
      "Agnifilo called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",
      "The lawyer argued prosecutors had invaded Combs' most intimate personal affairs, telling jurors: \"Where's the crime scene? It's your sex life.\"",
      "Agnifilo also argued there's another factor at play in the allegations that women have lobbed against Combs: the prospect of draining him of his wealth through lawsuits.",
      "\"This isn't about crime. It's about money. This is about money,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said Agnifilo had spent \"a whole lot of energy\" trying to distract from Combs' \"inexcusable behavior.\"",
      "\"Make no mistake,\" Comey told jurors, \"this trial was about how in Sean Combs' world, 'no' was never an option.\"",

      "Combs and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura Fine\u00a0had a \"loving, beautiful relationship,\" albeit a \"complicated\" one, Agnifilo said. \"If racketeering conspiracy had an opposite, it would be their relationship,\" Agnifilo said. \"They were deeply in love with each other.\"",

Slavik said Combs \"counted on silence and shame\" to allow his abuse to continue. She also said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up.",

    "summary": "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"The Fox,\" \"Voyage of the Damned,\" \"The Amityville Horror\" and \"The Sting II.\"",
    "story": [
      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \"Mission: Impossible\" and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin's son, Ryan Schifrin, confirmed the death to CBS News in a statement, saying his father \"succumbed to complications from pneumonia.\"",
      "\"His family was at his side, and he passed peacefully,\" Schifrin said. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to be there for him. We are still trying to process this loss, and are very moved by all the love and support we have received.\"",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"The Fox,\" \"Voyage of the Damned,\" \"The Amityville Horror\" and \"The Sting II.\"",
      "\"Every movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \"The movie dictates what the music will be.\"",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan.",
      "Schifrin's composition of the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme",
      "But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television's \"Mission: Impossible,\" which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \"only the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\" by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song, but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\"The producer called me and told me, 'You're going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it's going to start with a fuse,'\" Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \"So I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that's why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\"",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin's music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin's music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\"I remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\" Giacchino told NPR. \"And I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, 'Just have fun with it.' And I did.\"",
      "\"Mission: Impossible\" won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996's first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand's Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Schifrin's background and his other prolific work",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band.",
      "Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie's quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \"Gillespiana.\"",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965's \"Jazz Suite on the Mass Texts\" while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV's \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \"Tango,\" \"Rush Hour\" and its two sequels, \"Bringing Down The House,\" \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\" \"After the Sunset\" and the horror film \"Abominable.\"",
      "Writing the arrangements for \"Dirty Harry,\" Schifrin decided that the main character wasn't in fact Clint Eastwood's hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\"You would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\" he told the AP. \"I wrote a theme for Scorpio.\"",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\"Receiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\" Schifrin said at the time. \"It is mission accomplished.\"",
      "Among Schifrin's conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California's Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \"Christmas in Vienna\" in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \"Letters from Argentina,\" nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event's 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \"Songs of the Aztecs.\" The work premiered at Mexico's Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site's Aztec temple.",
      "\"I found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \"But the real answer is that there's something magic about it. ... There's something magic in the art of music anyway.\"",
      "In addition to his sons, he's survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "summary": "British indie pop artist MARINA talks about her return to music after recovering from chronic fatigue syndrome.",
    "story": [
      "For British indie pop icon MARINA, the most thrilling part of writing a record is when she finally nails what it's about.",
      "\"I was like, it's 'Princess of Power' \u2026 and it spells 'pop.' It's like, this is meant to be,\" MARINA said.",
      "Her sixth album, \"Princess of Power,\" comes after the artist \u2014 born Marina Diamandis \u2014 recovered from chronic fatigue syndrome while rebuilding her relationship with music and her identity.",
      "MARINA has scored billions of streams without ever having a top 10 single in the U.K. or U.S., yet her influence runs deep among a generation of artists including Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish. \"I think artists who are very commercially successful, like they'll have these peaks and troughs and mine's kind of like been like steadily going up,\" MARINA said.",
      "Although she admitted it's \"somewhat frustrating\" when music doesn't reach mainstream success, her dedicated fanbase never fails to find it.",
      "\"I always want people to choose to love my music. I don't want to shove it in anyone's face,\" she said.",
      "The origins of MARINA's journey",
      "The daughter of a Welsh mother and Greek father, MARINA moved from her hometown of Abergavenny, Wales, to London at 19. She was initially embarrassed to sing in public \u2014 but music felt like an \"innate calling.\"",
      "She overcame her stage fright \"painfully\" by going to open mic nights alone.",
      "\"I was like, if I'm bad, I need no one I know to see me be bad, which you can't do anymore, 'cause everyone's filming everything,\" she said, laughing.",
      "She launched her career with her 2010 debut \"The Family Jewels,\" then going by Marina and the Diamonds, followed by 2012's \"Electra Heart,\" which reached No. 1 on British charts.\u00a0But by 2016, success felt suffocating.",
      "\"And I just suddenly felt really trapped,\" she said. \"I felt like my identity was glued to my artist's identity. I just suddenly, like wanted out.\"",
      "Discovering health issues",
      "That same year, MARINA began experiencing mysterious symptoms that would later be diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome.",
      "\"The main symptom actually was buzzing all over,\" she explained. \"And it always started in my feet then it would basically go all the way up my body \u2026 like my face would basically be throbbing. Like my whole body would feel like it was ringing.\"",
      "It took six years to understand the condition was connected to her nervous system. Breathwork ultimately provided relief.",
      "\"I have had to basically change my whole life, like inside out,\" she said.",
      "While MARINA stepped back from her career, her early music found new life on TikTok.",
      "\"It is strange because I was so used to like pushing to make things happen in my career. And then suddenly this whole thing, you get three platinum records by doing nothing,\" she said.",
      "Now living in Los Angeles, MARINA approaches each album with detailed planning, usually in a journal. But this time, she made an album map for \"Princess of Power\" which includes a color palette, themes and the kind of energy she wanted the music to have: cosmic, love rush, euphoric, dazzling, bright light and powerful.",
      "\"This album was different because I think I'm at the point where I'm not writing so much to like heal myself,\" she said. \"I was like, I have this platform, and I want to make sure that whatever I'm putting out into the world has a certain type of energy that feels positive to me \u2026 because that's what I really needed two years ago when I started writing this.\"",
      "\"You don't get to do this many times in your life, you know, as an artist,\" she continued. \"So, I was like, this is the time I'm gonna do this. Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Performing these new songs allows MARINA to embody the transformation she's undergone.",
      "\"It's almost like making it public means I can suddenly step into it,\" she said. \"It's almost like I can finally say to people, 'This is who I am actually.' Like the person you knew four years ago has gone.\"",
      "That transformation represents more than recovery, it's a reclamation of her power.",

    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",
      "\"A month could be critical for her.\"",
      "\"It certainly can when you have metastatic cancer that's growing,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "That one-month delay means Natalie's specialized immune cell therapy won't be ready until late July. I said to her, \"I don't even know what seems like an appropriate question. You must be devastated.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:32:21 -0400",
    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",

      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",

    "story": [
      "Paramount will settle President Trump's lawsuit over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris for $16 million, the company announced late Tuesday.",
      "CBS News' parent company worked with a mediator to resolve the lawsuit. Under the agreement, $16 million will be allocated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library and the plaintiffs' fees and costs. Neither Mr. Trump nor his co-plantiff, Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, will be directly paid as part of the settlement.",
      "The settlement did not include an apology.",
      "Paramount also agreed that \"60 Minutes\" will release transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates in the future, \"subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns,\" the statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump's lawsuit, filed last October when he was still a candidate for president, was widely viewed as an attack on the First Amendment. He took issue with CBS News airing two different portions of Harris' response to a question about the Middle East, one in an early excerpt on \"Face the Nation\" and the other on the full broadcast of \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The lawsuit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, a portion of a federal district court where the sole judge is a 2019 Trump appointee, and it was based on a state consumer protection law that is intended to prevent advertisers from misleading the public about a product being sold. CBS News is not headquartered in Texas, nor did the interview take place there.",
      "He initially sought $10 billion in damages when he filed suit last October but upped his demand to $20 billion in February after adding a federal claim alleging false advertising and unfair competition. Jackson, a Texas Republican, joined Mr. Trump as a plaintiff in the amended complaint.",
      "Paramount has maintained that the lawsuit was completely without merit and that \"60 Minutes\" followed a standard editing process. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, stood behind the show's interview and said he would not apologize. He announced in April that he would depart the network, citing a loss of editorial independence.",
      "Weeks later, Wendy McMahon, who served as president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures, announced she was also departing. \"It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on a path forward,\" she wrote in a note to staffers.",
      "First Amendment scholars and constitutional experts largely viewed the lawsuit as a frivolous misapplication of the law.",
      "Geoffrey R. Stone, a First Amendment scholar and law professor at the University of Chicago, explained, \"That statute is about sales \u2014 a salesperson can be held liable for stating that a product has certain positive effects when he knows it doesn't. But CBS is not engaged in advertising here.\"",
      "Constitutional law expert and Harvard professor Noah Feldman called the case an \"outrageous violation of First Amendment principles.\"",
      "Politicians had also spoken out about the suit, urging Paramount Global Chair Shari Redstone not to settle. The day after McMahon announced her departure, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden sent a letter to Redstone raising concerns that efforts to settle with Mr. Trump would amount to bribery. Redstone had recused herself from settlement talks.",
      "In an April Truth Social post, Mr. Trump said he was \"honored\" to be suing CBS and Paramount. He also urged Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr to \"impose the maximum fines and punishment\" against CBS in connection with a news distortion complaint, which was filed by a conservative group over the same Harris interview. Outgoing FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel dismissed the complaint in January before former President Biden's term ended, but Carr reopened it days after Mr. Trump took office and appointed him to the role.",
      "Back in February, CBS complied with an FCC inquiry to hand over the transcript and videos from the Harris interview, simultaneously releasing those files to the public.",
      "CBS sought dismissal of the FCC complaint in a March filing, writing, \"The Complaint filed against CBS for 'news distortion' envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor \u2014 one that second guesses and even punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming.\"",
      "The news distortion complaint remains open and under investigation.",
      "The FCC's approval is necessary for Paramount's $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media to move ahead, and the agency didn't make a decision on the transaction by the informal 180-day deadline to review mergers, which passed in May. Carr said Thursday that the FCC was still reviewing the transaction.",
      "If completed, the Paramount-Skydance merger will cap off a long, turbulent sales process that attracted multiple potential bidders. Talks between Skydance and Paramount's corporate parent, National Amusements, were briefly called off before the sides resumed negotiations and clinched a deal in July 2024.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 18:17:20 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate budget bill would have imposed an excise tax on certain wind and solar projects with foreign materials.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate bill containing President Trump's domestic policy agenda at the last minute eliminated a new excise tax that would have hammered the renewable energy industry, a move that likely ensured Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska would back the measure.",
      "The excise tax would have been imposed on wind and solar energy projects constructed with a certain percentage of materials sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. Consumers would see their energy prices rise by around 8% to 10%, and the provision would have cost clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax was designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components was likely to be cost prohibitive.",
      "The Senate bill also made another key concession: it would phase out wind and solar tax credits for clean energy development on a slower timeline than originally proposed, ensuring that projects that have already been planned, financed and approved would still receive the applicable tax credit, as long as they begin construction before June 2026, or are operational by the end of 2027.",
      "But this is still a major modification from the original timeline for the wind and solar tax credit \u2014 which wasn't due to expire until 2032 \u2014 and it still puts clean energy developers in peril, according to environmental groups.",
      "Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an email to CBS News, \"By making it much, much harder to build new clean energy projects, the bill is effectively cutting off supply of cheap energy right when the U.S. needs it the most.\"",
      "Environmental groups said few gains were to be found in the bill.",
      "\"If there's a bright spot, it is that the Senate bill would preserve tax credits for newer technologies like advanced nuclear, battery storage, geothermal energy, and carbon capture, as well as advanced manufacturing,\" Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in a statement.",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers. It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems. The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities.",
      "A new analysis by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions predicted that the changes in the Senate bill would eliminate more than 1.6 million jobs, cause more than $290 billion in lost GDP, increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 8% by 2035 and increase the cost of energy by 4% per megawatt.",
      "Climate and environmental groups expressed concern about how the reduction of key tax incentives for clean energy production and energy efficiency will affect the public.",
      "\"The bill will raise energy costs and make it harder to keep the lights on,\" said Steven Nadel in a statement, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. \"No one asked Congress to make their energy bills even higher. Taking away incentives for energy-saving improvements would raise monthly bills for families and businesses. It will only exacerbate the growing strain on the electric grid.\"",
      "The bill now returns to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is intent on meeting Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the bill to President Trump's desk. To do so, the House will have to pass the Senate version unchanged. Any alteration would mean the bill would have to be considered by a conference committee to reconcile the differences. That's what Murkowski would prefer. \"We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we're not there yet.\"",

      "\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact \u2014 in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"",
      "Powell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.",
      "The president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.",
      "Although Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.",
      "The Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for overnight loans \u2014 steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.",
      "\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.",
      "\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\"",

      "Read on to find which cities have the most to offer U.S. workers.",
      "Which cities have the best overall job market?",
      "Bend, Oregon, has the top job market in the United States, according to SmartAsset. The West Coast city notched points for its low unemployment rate (3.1%) and high income growth. From 2020 to 2023, the median income in Bend grew 44% \u2014 the fourth highest rate after Richmond, Virginia, (50%); Nampa, Idaho, (47%); and Dayton, Ohio, (45%).",
      "A hub for outdoor recreation, Bend also stands out for its work-life balance. The median commute time for workers in Bend is 16 minutes, with just over a quarter of the city's population working remotely.",
      "Trailing Bend in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots for best overall job markets are Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington.",
      "Which cities have the highest percentage of health care coverage for workers?",
      "For workers looking for solid health care coverage, a move to Santa Clara, California, may be worth considering. Over 88% of the population in the southern Bay Area city have private health insurance plans through their employer. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Bellevue, Washington, follow close behind with roughly 87% of their residents having health coverage through their employers.",
      "Which cities have the shortest commutes?",
      "Spending large chunks of time sitting on a train or stuck in traffic is not conducive to good work-life balance. For that reason, cities with the shortest commute times contribute to top job market rankings in SmartAssets' study.",
      "With a median commute time of roughly 14 minutes, workers in Wichita Falls, Texas, have one the shortest commute times in the country, according SmartAsset. Abilene, Texas, and Topeka, Kansas, workers also spend less time in transit than others, with median commutes of around 14 and 15 minutes, respectively.",
      "Which cities are remote-work friendly?",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on worker tips could soon come to fruition after the Senate passed President Trump's massive budget package.",
      "One part of the legislation, the centerpiece of the Trump administration's economic agenda, would provide workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, with relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "Senators narrowly approved the legislation, which Republicans call the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" on July 1 by a vote of 51-50. The measure now returns to the House for sign off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the bill and urged lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "How would \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk, the world's richest person, reignited his criticism Monday of the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk ramped up his criticism of the massive tax and domestic policy package working its way through the Senate on Monday, suggesting he could support primary challenges against Republicans who vote for the Trump-backed bill.",
      "\"Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!\" the billionaire and onetime Trump ally wrote in a post on X. \"And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\"",
      "In a separate post, Musk said he will support Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill when it passed the House, leading Mr. Trump to back a primary challenge.",
      "Musk also suggested starting \"a new political party that actually cares about the people\" on Monday, an idea he first floated earlier this month. He said if the bill passes, a new political party \u2014 which he calls the \"America Party\" \u2014 \"will be formed the next day.\"",
      "Musk's latest swipes came as the Senate worked to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, holding a marathon series of amendment votes on Monday. The Senate still needs to vote on final passage, and the House will need to approve the Senate's changes, before a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the bill to Mr. Trump's desk.",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk is about the apparent threat to back primary challenges against supporters of the legislation \u2014 or what support, if any, he could offer to challengers. But it suggests Musk could remain involved in politics, after spending upwards of $250 million to help elect Mr. Trump and other Republicans last year. The Tesla CEO indicated last month he planned to dial back his political spending for now, saying, \"I think I've done enough.\"",
      "The vast majority of House and Senate Republicans have backed the bill, though some lawmakers have withheld their support, objecting to its Medicaid cuts or arguing it doesn't go far enough to slash spending. Mr. Trump has applied intense pressure to Republicans and lashed out at the remaining holdouts: In a statement last weekend, the White House said \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "Musk has railed against the legislation on and off for weeks. The billionaire blasted the bill in early June, calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" \u2014 igniting a dayslong feud between President Trump and the world's richest man that seemed to signal the end of a once close partnership.",
      "The billionaire, who once led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, backed down in mid-June and acknowledged some of his attacks on Mr. Trump \"went too far.\" He remained fairly quiet about the legislation for weeks, but his criticism has intensified in recent days, as lawmakers rush to finalize the bill by the end of the week.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0lashed out at Musk in an early Tuesday morning Truth Social post that noted Tesla has benefitted from federal electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 a program the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would phase out. The president also suggested DOGE should \"take a good, hard, look at\" other subsidies Musk has benefitted from.",
      "\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Musk responded to Mr. Trump's message: \"I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now.\"",
      "Why is Musk opposed to Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\"?",
      "Many of Musk's criticisms zero in on the bill's price tag, calling its spending levels \"insane\" and attacking a provision in the Senate version of the bill that hikes the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "But the billionaire has also panned the bill's cuts to green energy tax credits and excise tax on certain renewable energy projects, calling those provisions \"utter madness\" that could \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country.\"",
      "Those provisions could directly impact Musk's electric carmaker, Tesla. The phaseout of electric vehicle tax credits may cost the company $1.2 billion, an analysis by JPMorgan Chase estimated. Tesla's solar power and energy storage businesses also benefit from government incentives, and ending those programs \"may harm our business\" by \"making our products less competitive for customers,\" the company disclosed in an annual report filed earlier this year.",

      "GE Appliances executive Lee Lagomarcino said U.S. trade policy was the driving factor in the company's recent decision to accelerate a plan to move overseas jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Any time we decide to move a factory or redesign a platform, it's an expensive endeavor, so we have to think through the strategy and trajectory of market,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in discussing GE Appliances' move to expedite a shift in production of its washers and dryers from China to the U.S. in order to avoid having to pay\u00a0stiffer tariffs.",
      "\"This was the right time to strike on the business opportunity given the environment with tariffs,\" added Lagomarcino, vice president, clothes care, at GE Appliances.",
      "GE Appliances on June 26\u00a0announced it would invest $490 million in a laundry care manufacturing plant in Kentucky that would create 800 new American jobs. In a statement last week, GE Appliances CEO Kevin Nolan said the reshoring effort \"aligns with the current economic and policy environment.\"",
      "The company, which has long planned to reshore manufacturing to the U.S., said that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have impelled the household appliance maker to \"accelerate the decision-making,\" Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Once the plant is fully up and running, the company, a Haier subsidiary, will cease manufacturing in China. \"That factory will turn off when the factory in Louisville, Kentucky turns on,\" said Lagomarcino, adding that he expects the Kentucky plant to be operational by early 2027.",
      "What jobs is GE creating in the U.S.?",
      "The company is looking to fill research and development, engineering and supply chain positions at the Kentucky plant, openings for which it's already started posting on its careers site.",
      "\"We anticipate a lot of hiring for some skilled trades, and technically advanced manufacturing roles,\" Lagomarcino said. \"Our research and development team leader will need to hire more engineers, and our supply chain leader will have to hire to fill jobs.\"",
      "Why now?",
      "The investment in domestic manufacturing comes as a host of U.S. companies\u00a0announce plans\u00a0to reshore operations as they face added costs from Mr. Trump's tariff agenda.",
      "But the main force behind the production move to Louisville is GE's \"zero distance\" philosophy of building appliances where they are sold, the company said in the announcement.",
      "\"U.S. manufacturing allows us to be closer to the consumer and the team that designs and markets the products and is involved in the whole product development lifecycle,\" said Lagormarcino. \"Philosophically, and from a manufacturing and design standpoint, it makes sense.\"",
      "That said, the move makes even more sense with tariff increases in place, according to Lagormarcino.",

    "summary": "The GOP Senate version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" would raise the cost of wind and solar projects by 10% to 20%, one energy group estimated.",
    "story": [
      "Update: This tax provision was removed from the final version of the Senate bill that\u00a0passed on Tuesday, July 1. Read more here. Our earlier story is below.",
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

    "summary": "Lululemon is accusing Costco of stealing from its \"path-breaking\" brand by selling dupes of its sweatshirts, jackets and pants.",
    "story": [
      "Lululemon is suing Costco, accusing the discount retailer of selling \"confusingly similar\" replicas of its jackets, sweatshirts and pants.",
      "In a lawsuit filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the athletic and lifestyle apparel company claims that certain Costco products imitate its own designs so closely that it constitutes \"trade dress\" infringement, which occurs when a product mimics another so closely that it confuses consumers.",
      "The apparel company claims that Costco's \"knockoff\" designs, or product \"dupes,\" violate trademark law because \"some customers incorrectly believe these infringing products are authentic Lululemon apparel.\" In other cases, \"customers specifically purchase the infringing products because they are difficult to distinguish from authentic Lululemon products,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "\"Indeed, one of the purposes of selling 'dupes' is to confuse consumers at the point-of-sale and/or observers post-sale into believing that the 'dupes' are Plaintiffs' authentic products when they are not,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Lululemon refers to itself in the lawsuit as a \"path-breaking\" apparel company that has set a new standard for performance athletic wear, adding that its \"construction techniques\" and \"strategic fits\" help it stand out to consumers. Reached for comment, the Vancouver, Canada-based company said it fiercely defends its products.",
      "\"As an innovation-led company that invests significantly in the research, development and design of our products, we take the responsibility of protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights very seriously and pursue the appropriate legal action when necessary,\" a Lululemon company spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Costco did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "While copycat products can be so poorly constructed and designed that they pose no threat to the originals, Costco's dupes have caused a stir for their verisimilitude to the authentic Lululemon goods. A January headline in The Washington Post\u00a0read, \"Is that hoodie Lululemon or a Costco dupe? No one has to know but you.\" On social media, users post images and videos of Costco athletic-wear products with the hashtag #luludupe or #lululemondupes.",
      "What items does Lululemon say Costco copies?",
      "The items at the center of the lawsuit include Lululemon's popular \"Scuba\" hoodies and sweatshirts, its \"Define\" jackets, and \"ABC\" stretch pants \u2014 that resemble khakis pants \u2014 for men.",
      "Lululemon's Scuba hoodie retails for $118, while its Define jacket sells for $128. The ABC pants cost $128.",
      "According to Lululemon, Costco's infringing products include:",

    "summary": "Luckin, a China-based coffee company and rival to Starbucks is opening two stores in New York City on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "New Yorkers have a new logo in town as Luckin Coffee, a popular Chinese coffee chain, announces its debut in the United States.",
      "The Starbucks rival opened its first two stores in New York City on Monday, as the Xiamen-based coffee purveyor sets out to expand its market and garner favor with U.S. customers. The two Manhattan storefronts are located at 755 Broadway in Greenwich Village and 800 6th Ave in Chelsea.",
      "The Chinese company first announced its U.S. arrival last week,\u00a0posting on Instagram, \"Drip level: International. The rumors are true, NYC. You're luckin now.\" Since then, the chain has been teasing \"soft openings\" on its social media accounts, offering promotional deals to get customers in the door.",
      "Luckin did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Rapid growth in Asia",
      "Since launching in 2017, Luckin has scaled rapidly to over 24,000 stores, with locations in China, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, according to a recent financial report. Despite hiccups, including an accounting fraud scandal, and $475 million in losses last year as the company poured hundreds of millions of dollars into coffee beans, store rent and other costs, Luckin's profit margins have rapidly ballooned. This past quarter, the coffee chain made $1.2 million in revenue, a 41% increase from the year prior.",
      "The store's app-based concept, contrived by founder Jenny Zhiya Qian, was intended to echo that of a ride-hailing business, according to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "To purchase an item, Luckin customers browse the coffee store's menu and make payments directly online. This is a \"100% cashier-less environment,\" Luckin states\u00a0on its website, adding that the app-based store model is intended to maximize efficiency and keep costs low. The company's beverages in China are 30% cheaper than Starbucks beverages in the country, according to CNN.",
      "Luckin's menu offers a range of drinks from traditional items like matcha and lattes to more unconventional choices like its \"fruity Americano\" series. It also has a small pastry menu including a banana yogurt loaf,\u00a0 chocolate-chip cookie and a sausage, egg and cheese croissant, among other offerings.",
      "Competition with Starbucks",
      "Luckin's entr\u00e9e into the U.S. coffee market is a direct challenge to Starbucks, which is in the midst of revamping its brand image through the \"Back to Starbucks\" campaign as it struggles against declining sales and revenue.",
      "With more than 17,000\u00a0locations across the country, Starbucks has the upper hand in the U.S. In China, however, the Seattle-based coffee giant lost its hold to Luckin in 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported.",
      "Significantly cheaper menu items and a convenient in-app ordering model boded well for Luckin in China, though it remains to be seen if the same exact strategy will be applied in the U.S. market.",
      "A quick glance at Luckin's in-app menu shows that prices on key items are more or less on par with those at U.S. Starbucks stores. A 16-ounce drip coffee at Luckin, for instance, goes for $3.45 compared with $3.65 at Starbucks. A 16-ounce iced matcha, meanwhile, costs $6.45 at Luckin, or 20 cents more than the $6.25 equivalent at Starbucks. A bagel at both companies goes for $3.25.",
      "According to Luckin, the company has over 120 million registered app users. That's far more than Starbucks, which also offers customers the ability to order via app. In January, the Seattle-based company said it had 34 million people in its membership rewards program, which is run through the app and online.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of thousands of workers across more than a dozen cities and states will soon receive higher pay, thanks to minimum wage hikes set to take effect July 1.",
      "More than 800,000 workers in two states \u2014Alaska and Oregon \u2014 as well as Washington, D.C., will be impacted by higher minimum wages that go into effect July 1, according to the left-leaning economic think tank Economic Policy Institute (EPI). Additionally, a dozen cities and counties are also set to boost their baseline pay rates next month.",
      "The higher minimum wages come as the federal baseline rate remains at $7.25 an hour, where it's been parked since 2009. As the cost of living has crept higher in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have boosted their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"These minimum wage increases will put more money in workers' pockets, helping many of them and their families make ends meet,\" EPI state economic analyst Sebastian Martinez Hickey wrote in a post about the higher pay. \"The average increase in annual wages for a full-time, year-round worker resulting from these minimum wage hikes ranges from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.\"",
      "About 58% of the workers who will receive pay hikes are women, while Black and Hispanic workers will also disproportionately benefit, according to the EPI's analysis.",
      "For example, in states where the minimum wage will increase in July, Black workers make up 7% of workers who will receive raises, but only 4.5% of the wage-earning workforce. Similarly, nearly 27% of Hispanic workers will see their wages rise, though they make up just over 13% of the wage-earning workforce.",
      "While the federal minimum wage hasn't budged in 16 years, there have been periodic attempts to boost it, with the latest coming from Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, who earlier this month introduced legislation to increase the national baseline wage to $15 per hour. He was joined by Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch as a co-sponsor.",
      "Pay hikes in Alaska, D.C., and Oregon",
      "Alaska's baseline wage will rise by $1.09 to $13.00 an hour, which was approved via a ballot measure passed by voters. The boost will impact 6.3% of the state's workforce, or 19,400 people, who will see an average annual pay increase of $925, EPI calculates.",
      "In Washington, D.C., 7.5% of the workforce, or 62,200 workers, will benefit from the minimum wage rising by 45 cents to $17.95 an hour, thanks to an inflation adjustment formula. With the new minimum in place, a full-time worker in the nation's capital will earn an additional $727 in annual wages, on average, according to the EPI's calculations.",
      "Oregon's minimum wage will rise 35 cents to $15.05 an hour on July 1, also through an inflation adjustment, boosting pay for 9.4% of the state's workforce, or 801,700 workers. The average pay hike will equate to $420 annually.",

      "The digital services tax was due to hit companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It would have applied retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.",

      "Mr. Trump's announcement Friday was the latest swerve in the trade war he's launched since taking office for a second term in January.

She told\u00a0Vogue\u00a0the Dolce & Gabbana gown made her \"feel like a princess.\"",
      "Wedding location details were kept under wraps, but Italian newspapers and Venetian locals predicted it would take place at San Giorgio Maggiore, one of the Venetian islands, which is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore. Bezos and Sanchez invited some 200 guests, and many were seen boarding water taxis to the island for Friday's festivities.",
      "This is the second marriage for both Bezos, 61, and S\u00e1nchez, 55. Bezos was previously married to\u00a0philanthropist Mackenzie Scott, but the pair divorced in 2019. S\u00e1nchez's first marriage to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of the talent firm Endeavor, also ended in 2019.",
      "Ahead of the nuptials, movie stars, TV personalities and business titans were sighted around Venice. Some were seen arriving on Thursday at the Madonna dell'Orto church for the first of several planned events. Some of the more recognizable names seen in photos include Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, the Kardashians and Jenners, Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Tom Brady, Bill Gates, Diane von Furstenberg, Usher, Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.",
      "The influx of so much money and star power prompted protests from local Venetian residents, who launched the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign. It comes amid a\u00a0broader pushback against an overload of tourists across Europe, with some blaming the crowds of visitors for increased costs and rent.",
      "But nothing seemed to mar the celebratory mood as Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and their guests gathered for the big day.",

    "summary": "Tens of millions of Americans are unable to save for retirement through their jobs. \"That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis,\" one expert says.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are continually encouraged to sock away money in a 401(k) or other retirement plan to ensure a comfortable, if not cushy, life in their later years. Yet about half of all U.S. workers in the private sector lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a huge obstacle in building enough wealth to retire, a recent study finds.",
      "About 56 million workers at businesses across the U.S. are unable to save via a retirement plan through their jobs, according to the analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And while these employees can in principle save money on their own, many are forced to prioritize putting food on the table and paying the bills in the present over building a nest egg for the future, the study found.",
      "The findings underscore the widening divide between the retirement haves and have-nots, with almost 30% of Americans over age 59 lacking any savings\u00a0to fall back on when they stop working. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s can help workers save because the money is taken out of paychecks automatically on a pre-tax basis, while many employers also provide a company match, which helps boost savings.",
      "\"Deeply unequal\"",
      "\"Pew's findings confirm what we've known for years: America's retirement system is deeply unequal,\" retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"Nearly half of private sector workers \u2014 56 million people \u2014 lack access to workplace retirement plans. When we include gig, cash and many public-sector workers, the number grows to a staggering 83 million. That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis.\"",
      "About 70% of all U.S. retirement assets are held in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, including 401(k)s and pensions, as well as in government-sponsored plans, the Congressional Research Service found in a 2023\u00a0analysis. The remainder is tucked away in individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.",
      "While it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to these plans said they faced barriers to building wealth, the Pew survey found. For instance, one-third of workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account said they didn't have any money left over after the end of the month.",
      "\"To build wealth and achieve financial security, individuals and families need a convenient and effective way to accumulate assets,\" Pew noted in its analysis. \"Research shows that individuals are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if money is deducted automatically from their paychecks.\"",
      "Other researchers have highlighted the gaping holes in the American retirement system. For example, one 2023 analysis from the Economic Innovation Group found that 70% of low-income workers, or those earning $37,000 or less, lack employer-sponsored plans.",
      "Creaking Social Security system",
      "While financial gurus often exhort Americans to prepare for the time they can no longer work, the Pew research makes clear that people without access to a retirement plan face significant hurdles to achieving financial security, Ghilarducci noted.",
      "\"What the Pew report confirms, and what we experts knew for years, is that saving for retirement isn't much about personal responsibility as it is about access,\" she said.",
      "Ghilarducci added, \"Without a workplace plan, even the most disciplined and financially educated worker faces structural disadvantages for saving.\"",
      "The Pew research underscores that millions of Americans will approach their retirement years reliant on Social Security as their primary \u2014 or even only \u2014 source of income in old age. At the same time, the Social Security program is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast.",
      "At that point, roughly 70 million Social Security recipients would see their monthly benefits cut by about 20%. That would likely create financial hardship for the roughly 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who today rely on the program as their sole source of income.",
      "Although lawmakers still have time overhaul the program to strengthen its finances, Congress has yet to take steps to shore up Social Security.",
      "\"The Pew report is a wake-up call,\" Ghilarducci said. \"If Congress fails to act, the people most harmed are those who can least afford it \u2014 workers without retirement accounts and pensions, gig workers, and those earning low wages.\"",

The trade talks blowup comes only a week after the president met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the Group of Seven\u00a0economic summit in Alberta.",
      "\"We have just been informed that Canada, a very difficult Country to TRADE with, including the fact that they have charged our Farmers as much as 400% Tariffs, for years, on Dairy Products, has just announced that they are putting a Digital Services Tax on our American Technology Companies, which is a direct and blatant attack on our Country,\" the president wrote. \"They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us, also.

      "The U.S. economy shrank faster than previously thought during the first three months of 2025, with growth contracting for the first time in three years.",
      "The country's gross domestic product fell at an annual rate of 0.5% from January through March, the Commerce Department reported Thursday in its third and final GDP report\u00a0for the period. The agency's\u00a0initial first-quarter GDP report, issued in April, estimated a 0.3% decline, which was later revised to a 0.2% dip in its second print.",
      "First-quarter growth was weighed down by a surge of imports as U.S. companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect. Although a surge in imports can appear to lower economic growth because it shows a shift away from domestic consumption, that doesn't tell the whole story about the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "A category within the GDP data called \"real final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which measures the economy's underlying strength, rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. While that represents a solid number, it's down from the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "The new data also shows that consumers sharply pared spending earlier this year, with growth at 0.5%, down from a robust 4% during the last three months of 2024. First-quarter consumer spending fell to its lowest level since the pandemic ended, with Americans particularly cutting back on recreation and dining, Greg Daco, EY-Parthenon chief economist, said in a research note.",
      "\"What we're witnessing is an economy temporarily buffered from the tariff shock by smart logistics maneuvers, proactive pricing strategies and some foreign exporter concessions,\" Daco said.",
      "On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee that businesses' rush to build their inventories earlier this year ahead of tariffs taking effect has helped delay any inflationary impacts from the import duties.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by domestic importers, all or some of the costs are typically passed onto consumers. Stocking up on inventory early in the year has allowed companies to sell those goods without the added costs of tariffs, Powell noted.",
      "\"The things that are being sold at retail now, they might have been put into inventory before the tariffs in February or March,\" the Fed chief said. \"We think we should start to see this over the summer, in the June numbers and in the July numbers.\"",
      "Second-quarter rebound?",
      "The category of real final sales to private domestic purchasers includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics called the decline in that figure \"troubling,\u2033 though he doesn't expect to make a significant change to his near-term economic forecast.",

      "The PCE, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, shows household spending on goods and services.",
      "Economists are forecasting that the first-quarter's influx in imports won't be repeated in the second quarter, which spans April through June, and shouldn't weigh on GDP during the period.",

Bush in 2006, prevents Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem from following through on a plan to revoke temporary protected status, or TPS, of Haitians living in the U.S. under the program on Sept. 3, a few months before their status was set to expire under a Biden-era deadline.",
      "Nearly 350,000 people from Haiti are currently enrolled in the TPS program, which allows migrants to remain in the U.S. if their home country is unsafe due to war or natural disaster. The federal government first granted TPS designation to Haiti in 2010, and the Biden administration extended it for Haitian migrants until February 2026.",
      "DHS announced Friday that benefits will instead end in September, and unless migrants qualify for some other form of legal status, they will lose their right to work and may face deportation.",
      "In his ruling Tuesday, Hogan sided with a group of Haitian migrants who sued over the end to TPS for the Caribbean nation. The judge wrote that Noem \"does not have statutory or inherent authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation.\"",
      "Hogan said the DHS secretary \"cannot reconsider Haiti's TPS designation in a way that takes effect before February 3, 2026, the expiration of the most recent previous extension.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs have enrolled in schools, taken jobs, and begun courses of medical treatment in the United States in reliance on Haiti's TPS designation lasting until at least February 3, 2026,\" Hogan wrote in the 23-page ruling.",

And President Trump will continue delivering on his promises to end the exploitation of our immigration system.\"",

      "The number of migrants caught crossing the southern border illegally set a new historic monthly low in June, continuing an extraordinary lull in illegal immigration the Trump administration has attributed to its aggressive deportation efforts, preliminary government data obtained by CBS News shows.",
      "Last month, Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border recorded just over 6,000 apprehensions of migrants who entered the country without authorization, the lowest monthly tally ever reported by the agency, according to the preliminary Customs and Border Protection data. The previous monthly low reported by Border Patrol was in March, when the agency recorded around 7,200 migrant apprehensions.",
      "The numbers stand in stark contrast to the record levels of apprehensions made by Border Patrol under the Biden administration, which faced a humanitarian, political and operational crisis of unprecedented proportions at the southern border until it implemented restrictive asylum measures last year.",
      "During many months of former President Joe Biden's tenure, Border Patrol recorded more than 6,000 apprehensions each day. At their peak in late 2023, daily illegal crossings at the southern border topped 10,000 on some days.",
      "Tom Homan, the Trump administration's border czar, confirmed the roughly 6,000 Border Patrol apprehensions recorded in June. He added that Border Patrol did not release a single migrant for a second consecutive month. During some months under the Biden administration, tens of thousands of migrants were released into the U.S. with instructions to show up in immigration court to plead their cases.",
      "\"We have never seen numbers this low. Never,\" Homan wrote on X.",
      "While Border Patrol has not publicly reported monthly apprehension data before fiscal year 2000, the last time the agency averaged close to 6,000 migrant interdictions per month over a year was in the late 1960s, historical figures indicate.",

Immigration authorities were also directed to halt all releases, absent life-threatening circumstances.",
      "Mr. Trump has deployed thousands of additional active-duty troops to the southern border, tasking them with repelling illegal crossings through the construction of barriers.

      "Amid the historic lull in illegal crossings, hundreds of Border Patrol agents have been assigned to help ICE with immigration arrests away from the border, in places like Los Angeles.",
      "The administration has also staged an intense messaging campaign to compel immigrants in the U.S. illegally to self-deport. It has offered them carrots in the form of travel assistance through a government smartphone app and a $1,000 self-deportation bonus.",
      "But it has also threatened those who refuse to leave with arrest and forcible deportation, and even the possibility of ending up detained at the naval base in Guantanamo Bay, a tent facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" or a maximum-security mega prison in El Salvador.",
      "Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown has not been without criticism. In communities across the U.S., especially Democratic-led cities, videos of masked federal agents arresting unauthorized immigrants at courthouses or outside homes have triggered outcry from local residents and politicians.",
      "Some Republicans have urged the Trump administration to prioritize the arrest of migrants with serious criminal records amid concerns that its crackdown is extending well beyond the dangerous individuals the president promised to expel.

      "The president said Qatar and Egypt \u2014 who have previously helped mediate talks with Hamas \u2014 \"will deliver this final proposal.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington next Monday. The president told reporters Tuesday he expects to discuss both Gaza and Iran, which struck a separate ceasefire deal with Israel last week after a 12-day campaign between the two countries that included U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump said a ceasefire could begin \"sometime next week.\"",
      "Prior pushes for a ceasefire have stalled. In late May, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff proposed a 60-day ceasefire that would have required Hamas to release 10 living hostages taken from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, as well as the remains of another 18 dead hostages. In exchange, Israel would have released 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners, 1,111 Palestinian detainees and 180 deceased Palestinians.",
      "Israel supported that proposal, but Hamas said it responded with \"notes and amendments.\" Witkoff called Hamas' response \"totally unacceptable.\"",
      "The war began when Hamas launched a terror attack on southern Israel in October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages back to the Gaza Strip. Israel responded with an intense air and ground offensive in the Palestinian territory, killing more than 56,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "The two sides have agreed to two prior ceasefire and hostage release deals since the start of the 21-month conflict, the most recent of which ran from January to March.",
      "Since then, Netanyahu has said there is \"no way\" he will agree to end the war until Hamas is defeated, though he left the door open to cutting deals to release hostages.",
      "Israel said Tuesday it had \"expanded its operations to additional areas within the Gaza Strip, eliminating dozens of terrorists.\" Hamas' health ministry said Tuesday some 116 people had been killed across the territory over a 24-hour period.",
      "Separately, in recent weeks, the U.S. has financially supported a controversial new group to distribute food in the Gaza Strip, but the effort has faced frequent reports of fatal shootings by Israeli forces near food distribution sites. The group, known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, has defended its efforts.",

      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are visiting the facility alongside the president. The controversial detention facility is at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the Florida Everglades, which has its own runway in an environment known for its treacherous terrain and wildlife. Mr. Trump joked in his remarks that \"we're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.\"",
      "Mr. Trump invited the press to join his tour of the makeshift facility, which he called \"so professional and so well done.\" Rows of bunk beds were lined up behind chain fences.",
      "The president was asked if it could be a model going forward for other detention sites. \"It can be,\" he responded, adding that such a location is rare. Mr. Trump said he'd like to see similar temporary facilities in \"many states.\"",
      "DeSantis said they expect the first occupants of the detention center to arrive Wednesday. DeSantis said the site has been modified in just eight days to accommodate detainees, and he called the center an \"effective way\" to increase the numbers of removals and deportations of unauthorized immigrants as the state seeks to help the federal government's deportation efforts.",
      "The facility will have up to several thousand beds to house, process and deport individuals who were in the country illegally. Florida officials say the site will have at least 200 security cameras, at least 28,000 feet of barbed wire, 400-plus security personnel, and 24/7 air conditioning.",
      "In a roundtable alongside Mr. Trump, Noem told people who are in the country illegally and who may be watching on TV that they can still \"self-deport\" and get the chance to return to the United States legally in the future.",
      "\"If you don't, you may end up here,\" Noem said. \"And you may end up here and being processed, deported out of this country, and never get the chance to come back.\"",
      "DeSantis echoed Noem's message. \"Why would you want to come through 'Alligator Alcatraz' if you can just go home on your own?\" DeSantis said. \" I think a lot of people are going to make that decision.\"",

      "Phyllis Andrews, a retired teacher who drove in from Naples, Florida, to join the protest, told The Associated Press, \"I have a lot of immigrants I have been working with. They are fine people. They do not deserve to be incarcerated here.\"",

      "\"There is only one road leading in and the only way out is a one-way flight,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday. \"It is isolated, and surrounded by dangerous wildlife in unforgiving terrain.\"",

The Dade County Port Authority purchased 39 square miles of remote swampland with plans to build what would have been the largest airport in the world.",
      "But opposition to the Everglades Jetport grew, and the early work on the facility halted in 1970 after a federal report determined that it would \"inexorably destroy the South Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate budget bill would have imposed an excise tax on certain wind and solar projects with foreign materials.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate bill containing President Trump's domestic policy agenda at the last minute eliminated a new excise tax that would have hammered the renewable energy industry, a move that likely ensured Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska would back the measure.",
      "The excise tax would have been imposed on wind and solar energy projects constructed with a certain percentage of materials sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. Consumers would see their energy prices rise by around 8% to 10%, and the provision would have cost clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax was designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components was likely to be cost prohibitive.",
      "The Senate bill also made another key concession: it would phase out wind and solar tax credits for clean energy development on a slower timeline than originally proposed, ensuring that projects that have already been planned, financed and approved would still receive the applicable tax credit, as long as they begin construction before June 2026, or are operational by the end of 2027.",
      "But this is still a major modification from the original timeline for the wind and solar tax credit \u2014 which wasn't due to expire until 2032 \u2014 and it still puts clean energy developers in peril, according to environmental groups.",
      "Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an email to CBS News, \"By making it much, much harder to build new clean energy projects, the bill is effectively cutting off supply of cheap energy right when the U.S. needs it the most.\"",
      "Environmental groups said few gains were to be found in the bill.",
      "\"If there's a bright spot, it is that the Senate bill would preserve tax credits for newer technologies like advanced nuclear, battery storage, geothermal energy, and carbon capture, as well as advanced manufacturing,\" Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in a statement.",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers. It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems. The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities.",
      "A new analysis by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions predicted that the changes in the Senate bill would eliminate more than 1.6 million jobs, cause more than $290 billion in lost GDP, increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 8% by 2035 and increase the cost of energy by 4% per megawatt.",
      "Climate and environmental groups expressed concern about how the reduction of key tax incentives for clean energy production and energy efficiency will affect the public.",
      "\"The bill will raise energy costs and make it harder to keep the lights on,\" said Steven Nadel in a statement, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. \"No one asked Congress to make their energy bills even higher. Taking away incentives for energy-saving improvements would raise monthly bills for families and businesses. It will only exacerbate the growing strain on the electric grid.\"",
      "The bill now returns to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is intent on meeting Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the bill to President Trump's desk. To do so, the House will have to pass the Senate version unchanged. Any alteration would mean the bill would have to be considered by a conference committee to reconcile the differences. That's what Murkowski would prefer. \"We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we're not there yet.\"",

We're simply taking some time.\"",
      "Powell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.",
      "The president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.",
      "Although Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.",

      "\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.",
      "\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate narrowly passed President Trump's massive tax and spending bill Tuesday after a marathon series of amendment votes that stretched more than 24 hours, delivering a major victory for the president and bringing the signature piece of legislation of his second term one step closer to his desk.",
      "The measure passed in a 51 to 50 vote, with all but three Republicans supporting the bill. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. GOP Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine joined all Democrats in voting against the bill.",
      "The vote came after the Senate worked through the weekend and into a scheduled recess to pass the bill, which now returns to the House for sign-off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the measure, and pushed lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "The legislation's passage also marks a significant victory for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who worked to sway GOP holdouts to back the legislation amid opposition on multiple fronts that threatened to thwart the bill's progress in recent days.",
      "\"This was an incredible victory for the American people,\" Thune said after the vote.",
      "Known by the GOP as the \"big, beautiful bill,\" the legislation includes ramped-up spending for border security, defense and energy production and extends trillions of dollars in tax cuts, partially offset by cuts to health care and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the legislation would increase federal deficits by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "While some Republicans had taken issue with the legislation's impact on the deficit, others cited concern with some of the steep cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO has said would leave nearly 12 million more Americans without health coverage over the coming years. And with a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders could only afford to lose three Republican votes, with Vance as a tie-breaker. But those concerns were not enough to defeat the legislation, and last-minute changes secured the support of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, while apparently quelling other possible opponents to the bill.",
      "Mr. Trump welcomed news of the vote during a trip to Florida. \"There is something for everyone [in the bill], and I think it's going to go very nicely in the House,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Actually, I think it will be easier in the House than it was in the Senate.\"",
      "The path to passage",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, met with possible holdouts in his office as the vote series stretched late Monday and into the wee hours Tuesday. The majority leader met with fiscal hawks including Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rick Scott of Florida, and at another point in the night, he met with Paul, who had pledged to oppose the bill over a provision raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "Thune also talked briefly with Murkowski early Tuesday, since it appeared likely that her vote could make or break the bill in the Senate. The Alaska Republican had concerns about cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs and their impact on her state.",
      "Murkowski told reporters after the vote that her thought process on the bill was \"agonizing.\"",
      "\"I struggled mightily with the impact on the most vulnerable in this country,\" Murkowski said, citing the cuts to social safety net programs. But she outlined the unique conditions in her state, and the support Alaska received in the final version of the bill, saying \"I had to look on balance because people in my state are the ones that I put first.\"",
      "In a statement later in the afternoon, Murkowski said, \"My sincere hope is that this is not the final product.\"",
      "\"This bill needs more work across chambers and is not ready for the President's desk,\" she wrote. \"We need to work together to get this right.\"",
      "Senate Republicans advanced the legislation late Saturday, with all but two voting in favor following hours of delay as the GOP worked to iron out last-minute details and dispel concern among holdouts, including the fiscal hawks, Murkowski and Collins.",
      "Paul and Tillis were the two Republicans to oppose the bill's advancement Saturday, and they both voted against the legislation on final passage. With a handful of other possible opponents, Thune told reporters overnight that GOP leaders were working to determine what \"everybody has to have in terms of votes,\" a sign that the vote would come down to the wire.",
      "The Senate action comes after the House narrowly passed the bill last month. Senate Republicans worked to put their mark on the legislation, treading carefully so as not to throw off the delicate balance in the lower chamber.",
      "The House will need to approve the Senate's changes to the bill before it can head to the president's desk for his signature. And lawmakers are trying to move quickly, with a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the measure signed. The House could return to Washington as early as Wednesday to begin consideration of the revised bill.",
      "Senate Republicans passed the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which enables the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. The Senate worked through the weekend as the GOP entered a final sprint on the legislation ahead of the July 4 deadline.",
      "Senate Democrats combatted the legislation in one of the only ways available to them: by delaying the process. Democrats forced the bill to be read in its entirety over the weekend, totaling nearly 16 hours, before using debate time to rail against the bill, and proposing amendments to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "On Monday, the Senate began what's known as a \"vote-a-rama,\" in which senators could offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. Democrats proposed a number of amendments to attempt to roll back some of the bill's more controversial provisions, to no avail. As the votes stretched overnight Monday and into Tuesday, senators voted on a handful of notable amendments, including a near-unanimous vote to eliminate language from the bill that would have put a pause on state regulations on artificial intelligence. The Senate also approved an amendment to move up Medicaid eligibility verification requirements preventing payments for people who are deceased.",
      "An amendment proposed by Collins that would have increased the rural hospital stabilization fund from $25 billion to $50 billion and imposed a higher tax rate on the wealthy to pay for the larger fund fell short. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote that the amendment was like putting a \"band aid on an amputation \u2014 it doesn't fix the problem.\" The outcome made it less likely that Collins would ultimately support the bill, although the change was expected to be included in a wide-ranging amendment to the bill.",
      "During the marathon vote series, the Senate also addressed an outstanding disagreement over the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing. Though Democrats railed against the move as the \"nuclear option,\" the chamber voted along party lines to affirm the use of the current policy baseline.",
      "Schumer lambasted the bill after the vote, criticizing Republicans for bowing to the president.",
      "\"The American people will remember the Republican betrayal,\" Schumer said.",
      "Cristina  Corujo, \n                                                  \n                                  Emily  Hung and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island has blocked the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing mass layoffs and overhauling some of its sub-agencies, finding there to be \"no rational basis\" for the Trump administration's reorganization plans that would have \"devastating consequences\" across the country if enacted.",
      "The suit was brought by 19 Democratic attorneys general and Washington, D.C., in May, seeking to block an agency restructuring plan announced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in March.",
      "Their complaint warned of \"severe, complicated, and potentially irreversible\" consequences to public health services nationwide if the plan went forward, potentially \"paralyzing\" the agency \"by means of a confusing reorganization.\"",
      "\"Critical public health services have been interrupted, databases taken offline, status of grants thrown into chaos, technical assistance services gone, and training and consultation services curtailed. These are not unsubstantiated fears,\" Judge Melissa DuBose wrote in her opinion granting the states' request for a preliminary injunction.",
      "\"HHS has failed to produce a shred of evidence that services to States and access to critical information would continue uninterrupted, that the harms are minimal or not irreparable, or that it is authorized to act absent Congressional action,\" she added.",
      "The judge also ordered the parties to address whether and how the Supreme Court's recent ruling limiting universal injunctions should apply to her order. In that case, which stemmed from President Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court limited the use of universal injunctions in cases with individuals as plaintiffs, but gave lower courts more latitude in cases brought by states.",
      "The states had cited concerns with the restructuring at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA's tobacco products center, the Office of Head Start and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",
      "\"The Executive Branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\" DuBose wrote.",
      "As part of Kennedy's restructuring plan, he moved to lay off some 10,000 employees at the nation's health agencies and ordered remaining officials to draw up plans to reorganize their work. Several offices and teams are slated to move under the plans, many into a new agency Kennedy wants to create called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA.",
      "Most of those employees remain off the job after getting their layoff notices in April but are still being paid, due to cases that sought to block their terminations.",
      "\"HHS is the backbone of our nation's public health and social safety net \u2014 from cancer screenings and maternal health to early childhood education and domestic violence prevention,\" said New York Attorney General James in a statement after the ruling.",

      "\"The people who were subject to the reduction in force are on administrative leave, and they will remain on administrative leave until the injunction is lifted,\" Kennedy said at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said planning has been ongoing for the next steps of the reorganization and merger, even as Kennedy has cited the court rulings as a reason to dodge questions about the restructuring on Capitol Hill.",
      "Officials from the Health Resources and Services Administration visited the CDC's campuses in Atlanta in recent weeks, they said, in a meeting of senior leaders between the two agencies.",
      "Most remaining teams focused on chronic disease from the two agencies are supposed to start being transferred into the new AHA agency, Kennedy has said, if the injunction is lifted.",
      "A few hundred layoffs have also been reversed in the weeks since the initial cuts, including those of scientists, researchers and health officials the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the FDA.",
      "But officials have also been told that further layoffs might be demanded by the Trump administration from health agencies in order to \"balance out\" the jobs that were restored.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday narrowly passed a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda in a 51-50 vote that required Vice President JD Vance to break a tie.",
      "The vote came after a marathon session that featured votes on amendments to key portions of the bill by senators of both parties.",
      "At the center of what Republicans call the \"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is slated to sunset at year's end. The legislation would make most of the tax cuts permanent, while increasing spending for border security, defense and energy production.",
      "The bill is partially paid for by cuts to health care and nutrition programs, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the Senate's bill would add $3.3 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance. Republicans and the White House dispute those forecasts.",
      "Senate Republicans used a process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, which limits the types of policies that can be included in a simple majority vote. A handful of provisions that initially appeared in the bill were ultimately removed, including one that would have ordered the sale of public lands and another that would have paused state regulations on artificial intelligence.",
      "The House passed its own version of the legislation last month, with some key differences. The lower chamber must now approve the Senate's version before it can go to the president's desk. If the House makes changes of its own, the Senate would need to sign off on those as well.",
      "Here's what is in the 887-page bill:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. Like the House-passed bill, the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. But the Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, isn't in compliance with Senate reconciliation rules.",
      "The parliamentarian also weighed in on the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in recent weeks. It's a departure from the House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Homeland security and immigration",
      "The legislation includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "It also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The Senate bill still shifts the costs of SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "The package also aligns with the House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18 and 54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18 and 64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the House-passed bill. Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, saying that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress are aiming to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike. The House version reverts the increase to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct a certain amount of tip wages and overtime from their taxes. The provisions would expire in 2028.",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate\u00a0versions\u00a0vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The Senate wants to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year. The House bill, however, would expand the deduction only through 2028.",

      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",

      "If he does not pass his credible fear interview, he will be deported to an unknown third-party country, says McGoldrick. He said if Naser were to return to Afghanistan, he would face \"certain death,\" although a return to his origin country was unlikely given the U.S. doesn't have diplomatic relations with the country under the Taliban.",
      "Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could resume deportations to third-party countries. McGoldrick said that Naser could be sent to Kosovo or South Sudan.",
      "In a statement shared by #AfghanEvac, Naser said\u00a0he worked with the American government in Afghanistan and followed all the legal processes for immigrating to the U.S. Now, he said he sits in detention, punished and treated like a \"criminal.\"",
      "\"Please \u2014 don't turn your back on us,\" Naser's statement reads. \"Keep your promises. Let me live in peace with my family in this country I love.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News last week, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Naser entered the U.S. \"unvetted\" via the CBP One app under the Biden administration in 2024. McLaughlin said DHS has found nothing in his immigration records indicating that he assisted the U.S. government in any capacity, adding that all of his claims will be heard by a judge.",
      "Any Afghan who fears persecution is able to request asylum, she said.",
      "At a news conference Monday, Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, called on Congress to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would allow Afghans who have sought refuge in the U.S. since American troops withdrew from the country in 2021 to apply for permanent legal residency.",
      "\"We owe those who served alongside us nothing less,\" said Coons. \"And we owe the veterans, the Americans who served and fought in Afghanistan, nothing less.\"",
      "Video shows arrest by ICE agents",
      "In a video obtained by CBS News, two unidentified ICE agents put Naser in handcuffs and escorted him from the courthouse on June 12.",
      "An Afghan ally who served alongside U.S. forces was legally paroled into the U.S. and showed up for his first hearing.@DHSGov detained him anyway\u2014using a vague \u201cimprovidently issued\u201d excuse.He followed the rules.We have the video.This must stop.#AfghanEvac #DueProcess pic.twitter.com/zZXjzQUDMT",

      "Naser was legally paroled into the U.S in 2024, according to immigration case files reviewed by CBS News. In addition to an active asylum case, he has a pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) case because of his long history supporting the U.S. military. SIVs are provided to foreign nationals who worked with U.S. military forces\u00a0in war zones including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Naser has no criminal record in the U.S. or Afghanistan, according to court records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This man served with our troops. He came through the front door. He followed every rule. And we locked him up anyway,\" said\u00a0 VanDiver. He said it's unknown how many Afghan allies have been detained by ICE officials.",
      "Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan from 2015 to 2018. He and his brothers also co-owned a logistics company that provided anti-mining support to American troops, according to employment records viewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This individual was an important part of our Company commitment to provide the best possible service for our clients, who were the United States Military in Afghanistan,\" says one employment document submitted as part of Naser's SIV application.",
      "But after the U.S. withdrew from the country in August 2021, his partnership with American forces put targets on the backs of Naser and his family. In 2023, Taliban fighters killed his brother and abducted his father at a family wedding. The attack drove Naser out of the country and forced his wife and children to flee their home.",
      "\"I cannot return to Afghanistan under any circumstances because I am accused of collaborating with U.S. forces. From the Taliban's perspective, anyone who worked with foreign forces during the past 20 years is a spy, an infidel, and must be killed,\" Naser wrote in his asylum declaration. His family remains in hiding outside of Afghanistan.",
      "After his brother was killed, Naser fled to Brazil, where he was granted a humanitarian visa. He then made the more than 6,000 mile journey on foot through the Dari\u00e9n Gap before reaching Mexico. In 2024, he set up an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app formerly known as CBP One \u2014 which allowed migrants to schedule appointments at legal ports of entry \u2014 where he was granted lawful parole into the U.S.",
      "As part of his asylum process, Naser was required to attend an in-person hearing last week in front of a judge and a lawyer from the Department of Homeland Security. But when Naser showed up to court, the DHS lawyer said that his case was \"'improvidently issued.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what that means,\" said McGoldrick, who tried to dispute the ruling. When pressed, the DHS lawyer refused to clarify further.",
      "\"'Improvidently issued' is becoming ICE's new catch-all \u2014 a vague, unchallengeable justification being used to clear dockets and meet removal and detention quotas,\" said VanDiver. \"It's being weaponized to put lawful, parole-compliant asylum-seekers in cells.\"",
      "When Naser left the courtroom after his hearing ended, he was immediately detained by ICE agents.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS said Naser \"entered the U.S. unvetted via the CBP One app under the previous administration in 2024. There is nothing in his immigration records indicating that he assisted the U.S. government in any capacity. All of his claims will be heard by a judge. Any Afghan who fears persecution is able to request asylum.\"",
      "Naser is now being held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. According to McGoldrick, he could be kept there for up to three months while his asylum case is adjudicated. If he is denied asylum, Naser will be put on an expedited removal list and likely deported. His lawyer does not know where he would be deported to.",
      "\"He's still in shock. He cannot believe this is happening to him,\" McGoldrick said.",
      "Naser's wife, who remains in hiding with their children, found out about her husband's detention when she saw the video of his detainment on social media.",
      "Increase in arrests in courthouses",
      "The last few weeks have seen an increase in ICE arrests outside of immigration hearings in courthouses around major American cities. In May, CBS News reported that the Trump administration was launching an operation to expedite the deportation of certain migrants by dismissing their cases and subsequently arresting them at courthouses around the country. The move shocked immigration advocates, as their clients are legally required to show up at their hearings.",
      "Public arrests outside courts in Los Angeles led to more than a week of demonstrations as protesters faced off against thousands of law enforcement officials, including the National Guard.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump called on ICE to increase arrests in order to achieve his goal of the \"largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History,\" according to a post on Truth Social, the social media platforms he owns.",
      "Reports from within the administration say that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been pushing agencies since late May to meet a higher quota of deportations \u2014 including as much as 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.",
      "Typically, ICE agents need probable cause in order to detain someone to check their immigration status. This requires a higher standard of evidence pointing to an individual's alleged violation of immigration law.",
      "It's not clear in Naser's case what evidence there is that he was violating the law, his lawyer said. ICE provided a warrant for Naser's arrest to his attorney outside the courtroom after he was detained.",
      "\"It's really shocking what's happening in courthouses in San Diego and around the country,\" said McGoldrick. \"You walk down the hall and it's like you're walking down executioner's row. There's all these armed personnel just eyeballing everybody as we come down. It's just so intimidating that our clients are terrorized.\"",
      "Uncertain future for thousands of Afghans",
      "The Trump administration has demonstrated a sharp turn away from supporting Afghans who worked with the U.S. government in the military's two-decade-long conflict with the Taliban.",
      "In May, Noem announced that the administration was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. TPS is an immigration designation that allows people from countries deemed dangerous by the U.S. to live and work in the United States without being detained by DHS. Nearly 11,000 Afghans who are in the U.S. under TPS will be at risk of deportation when the change in policy comes into effect in mid-July, said VanDiver.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration also instituted a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries, citing a need to address security concerns. Ahead of this announcement, over 100,000 Afghan wartime allies and their families had been vetted and cleared to enter the U.S., says #AfghanEvac. They are now unable to travel to the U.S. unless they are granted an SIV visa and can fund their own travel, without government support. Many live in danger of retribution from the Taliban.",
      "\"Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities,\" said VanDiver. \"The United States cannot abandon its allies and call that immigration policy.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 13:32:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Senate and House Republicans would each cut Medicaid spending significantly, and there are some differences between the two bills.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans plan to slash Medicaid funding to help offset the tax cuts and new spending included in President Trump's massive domestic policy bill. There are some differences between the approaches taken by Senate and House Republicans, making Medicaid among the most divisive issues lawmakers have had to navigate in recent months.",
      "Staring down a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the \"big, beautiful bill\" to Mr. Trump's desk, Republican lawmakers have yet to settle their differences. The Senate version, which passed narrowly on Tuesday, is expected to face some resistance in the House, which passed a separate version in May. No Democrats are expected to support the bill.",
      "Medicaid cuts",
      "About 71 million Americans are enrolled in Medicaid, according to the government's most recent data. According to a Congressional Budget Office report published late Saturday, the changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act in the Senate version would result in an increase of nearly 12 million more uninsured people by 2034.",
      "The House-passed version would leave slightly fewer without health insurance \u2014 nearly 11 million \u2014 by 2034, mostly due to cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, the CBO estimated earlier in June.",
      "The Senate version makes $930 billion in cuts over a decade to Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, according to the CBO. The House-passed bill includes nearly $800 billion in cuts.",
      "Work requirements",
      "Both versions include new work requirements for the popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans and people with disabilities. They require adults to work, volunteer or study 80 hours a month to qualify for enrollment, unless they have an exception.",
      "The House-passed bill includes work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64, beginning no later than 2026. There are exemptions for caregivers for dependent children or for pregnant women, among others.",
      "The Senate version expands the House bill by requiring parents of children over the age of 14 to work.",
      "Reporting requirements",
      "Both the Senate and the House would require Medicaid recipients to prove their eligibility twice a year, instead of annually.",
      "Home equity and Medicaid",
      "Under both chambers, applicants wouldn't qualify for Medicaid if their home equity is valued at more than $1 million, regardless of inflation. Under current law, state-determined maximum limits on home equity are between $730,000 and $1,097,000 and are indexed to inflation.",
      "Preventing Medicaid payments to dead people",
      "The Senate approved an amendment to move up Medicaid eligibility verification requirements, a measure aimed at preventing payments for people who are deceased. This was originally supposed to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2028, and Republican Sen. John Kennedy's amendment moved it to Jan. 1, 2027.",
      "Provider taxes",
      "States can boost federal Medicaid contributions to their states through what's known as a provider tax, often levying taxes on health care providers, which raises the overall cost of a service and therefore increases the portion reimbursed by the state.",
      "The House measure aims to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "But their Senate counterparts want to incrementally lower provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032 in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0Forty states have adopted the Medicaid expansion, and under that provision, the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees while the states are responsible for 10%. The federal government's portion for those covered through traditional Medicaid can range from 50% to 83%.",
      "Senate Republicans also added a $25 billion fund to help rural hospitals after some GOP senators expressed concern about how they could be affected by the change to provider taxes.",
      "Gender transition care",
      "The House bill prohibits federal Medicaid funding from covering gender transition services for children and adults, including surgeries, hormone therapy and puberty blockers.",
      "The Senate version included a similar provision, but the parliamentarian determined that it did not comply with the chamber's rules guiding the reconciliation process, meaning it either needed to be removed or modified to be included.",
      "Planned Parenthood funding",
      "Conservatives have long tried to stop Planned Parenthood from receiving federal funds. The Hyde Amendment bans the use of any federal funds for abortion, but Planned Parenthood receives Medicaid money for other services.",
      "Both versions seek to strip Planned Parenthood from receiving any Medicaid payments. The Senate version stops the payments for one year, while the House version ends them for 10 years.",
      "Limits on retroactive coverage",
      "Currently, states must cover Medicaid benefits retroactively for three months before an eligible individual signs up for coverage. The Senate and House bills would reduce that to one month.",
      "Co-payments for services",
      "For those whose incomes are over 100% of the federal poverty level, which in 2025 is $15,650 for an individual and $32,150 for a family of four, states would be required to impose co-payments of up to $35 for medical services, with some exclusions, including for primary care. Both the Senate and House bills contain this provision, but the Senate version would make exceptions for certain types of health care providers.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration recently transferred immigration detainees from countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Caribbean to detention facilities at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, dramatically expanding the nationalities of those held there, internal U.S. government records obtained by CBS News show.",
      "As of earlier this week, Guantanamo Bay's immigration detainees \u2014 who are detained separately from the terrorism suspects also held at the U.S. military base \u2014 included nationals of China, Jamaica, Liberia and the United Kingdom, according to the federal documents.",
      "Two U.S. officials said most of those detained at the base are considered to be \"high-risk\" detainees, who are defined by immigration authorities as individuals with violent or otherwise serious criminal records, histories of disruptive behavior or alleged gang ties.",
      "The transfers, which had not been previously reported, signal a significant expansion in the Trump administration's efforts to turn parts of Guantanamo Bay into immigration detention facilities to hold foreigners facing deportation.",
      "Since President Trump ordered his administration to detain \"high-priority\" foreigners with criminal records at the base earlier this year, the facilities there have mainly housed Spanish-speaking Latin American detainees from countries such as Nicaragua and Venezuela before their formal deportation.",
      "But the decision to use Guantanamo Bay to hold immigration detainees from more far-flung nations in Africa, Asia and Europe underscores the broad scope of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "A defense official told CBS News there were 54 immigration detainees at Guantanamo Bay on Tuesday.",
      "It's unclear why exactly the administration decided to transfer detainees from Asia, Africa and Europe to Guantanamo Bay. But the immigration detention system in the U.S. is well over its congressionally funded capacity, as ICE has increased efforts throughout the country to arrest immigrants in the U.S. illegally.",
      "In early June, Politico reported that officials were vetting thousands of detainees from different countries, including European allies, for a potential transfer to Guantanamo Bay, a report that the White House denied at the time.",
      "Representatives for the Departments of Homeland Security and State did not answer a series of questions, including on whether the African, Asian and European detainees are expected to be deported from Guantanamo Bay.",
      "The Trump administration's use of Guantanamo Bay to further its mass deportation agenda has garnered strong criticism and legal challenges from civil rights advocates, who argue the government does not have the authority to hold immigration detainees outside of the U.S. The base, which sits on Cuban land, was controversial before it became an immigration holding center, due to the indefinite detention of terrorism suspects, some of whom faced torture and abuse.",
      "While top Trump administration officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller have repeatedly highlighted the detention efforts at Guantanamo Bay, they have provided scant public information on operations at the base and who is being sent there.",
      "Reporting by CBS News and other news organizations has confirmed that the administration has sent both detainees deemed to be \"high-risk\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo Bay, including Venezuelan men whose relatives have denied accusations that they were gang members.",
      "Those classified as \"high-risk\" have been detained at Guantanamo Bay's Camp VI, a part of the post-9/11 prison that still holds roughly a dozen terrorism suspects, though in a separate section of the complex.",
      "The \"low-risk\" detainees \u2014 who by definition lack a serious criminal record or any record at all, beyond civil immigration violations \u2014 have been housed at the Migrant Operations Center, a barrack-like facility on the base historically used to accommodate asylum-seekers interdicted at sea.",
      "CBS News also revealed in May an internal government memo showing that officials created a broad set of criteria for who could be sent to Guantanamo Bay that did not mention criminality, despite the president saying that only individuals who he called \"the worst\" would be held at the base.",
      "The Department of Defense told Congress in May that as of April 8 it had spent $21 million flying immigration detainees to Guantanamo Bay, or more than $26,000 per flight hour.",
      "As of Tuesday, the base's Camp 6 prison and Migrant Operations Center were housing 41 and 13 detainees, respectively, a defense official said.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to send a message of deterrence by using or proposing controversial detention centers like Guantanamo Bay to hold those accused of violating U.S. immigration law.",
      "In March, the administration flew more than 200 Venezuelans it labeled gang members to El Salvador, which imprisoned them at CECOT, its infamous maximum-security prison. More recently, the Trump administration has announced it is working with Florida state officials to set up an immigration detention center in the wetlands of the Everglades. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump visited the facility, which officials have dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump recently indicated diplomatic talks with Iran could restart as soon as this week, although the White House noted no talks were officially scheduled. After U.S. airstrikes on some of Iran's nuclear facilities, followed days later by a\u00a0ceasefire to end what Mr. Trump called the\u00a012-day war between Iran and Israel, Iran's foreign minister seemed less certain about a speedy return to diplomacy.",
      "\"I don't think negotiations will restart as quickly as that,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS News through a translator.",
      "\"In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations,\" Araghchi said in his first interview with an American media outlet inside Iran since the bombings. \"And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time.\"",
      "However, Araghchi also insisted, \"The doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said during a televised address following the American strikes on June 21 that Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site and the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated.\" Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a news conference, \"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction.\"",
      "Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency,\u00a0told CBS News the U.S. strikes caused \"severe damage, but it's not total damage.\" Grossi said Iran could likely start enriching uranium again within a few months.",
      "\"One cannot obliterate the technology and science for enrichment through bombings,\" Araghchi said. \"If there is this will on our part, and the will exists in order to once again make progress in this industry, we will be able to expeditiously repair the damages and make up for the lost time.\"",
      "When asked if Iran intends to continue enriching uranium, Araghchi said the country's \"peaceful nuclear program has turned into a matter of national pride and glory. We have also gone through 12 days of imposed war, therefore, people will not easily back down from enrichment.\"",

      "\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far,\" Mr. Trump said on his Truth Social platform, \"and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa.\"",
      "The president also suggested his Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which Musk headed before stepping down late May \u2014 could train its sights on the SpaceX founder's business interests.",
      "\"No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!\"",
      "Musk, who had an acrimonious public falling out with the president over the budget bill, ramped up his criticism of the massive tax and domestic policy package Monday, suggesting he could support primary challenges against Republicans who vote for it.",
      "\"Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!\" the billionaire and onetime Trump ally wrote in a\u00a0post on X. \"And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\"",
      "Musk\u00a0also suggested\u00a0starting \"a new political party that actually cares about the people\" on Monday, an\u00a0idea he first floated\u00a0earlier this month. He\u00a0said\u00a0if the bill passes, the new party \u2014 which he called the \"America Party\" \u2014 \"will be formed the next day.\"",
      "Early last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0there would be \"serious consequences\" for Musk if he funds Democratic candidates who run against Republicans who vote in favor of the budget measure.",
      "Mr. Trump is hoping to seal his legacy with the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" which would extend his expiring first-term tax cuts at a cost of $4.5 trillion and beef up border security.",
      "But Republicans eyeing 2026 midterm congressional elections are divided over the package, which would strip health care from millions of the poorest Americans and add to the country's debt.",
      "As lawmakers began voting on the bill on Monday, Musk \u2014 the world's richest person \u2014 accused Republicans of supporting \"debt slavery.\"",
      "\"All I'm asking is that we don't bankrupt America,\" he said on social media Tuesday. \"What's the point of a debt ceiling if we keep raising it?\"",

To join in the celebration, the might of America's Air Force will conduct a flyover featuring our state-of-the-art F-22s, B-2s, and F-35s - the same air capabilities used for the decisive and successful strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump first said the pilots would be invited to the White House at some point in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" last weekend.",
      "The Pentagon said seven B-2 bombers participated in the strikes on Fordo and Natanz, flying continually for the entire 36-hour round trip from Missouri to Iran and back \u2014 requiring multiple mid-air refuelings and assistance from fighter jets. The B-2s dropped 14 \"bunker buster\" bombs on Fordo and Natanz, while submarines launched cruise missiles at Iran's Isfahan nuclear site.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP Senate version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" would raise the cost of wind and solar projects by 10% to 20%, one energy group estimated.",
    "story": [
      "Update: This tax provision was removed from the final version of the Senate bill that\u00a0passed on Tuesday, July 1. Read more here. Our earlier story is below.",
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration eliminated the CDC team that developed national guidelines for prescribing contraception safely for millions of women with underlying medical conditions.",
    "story": [
      "For Brianna Henderson, birth control isn't just about preventing pregnancy.",
      "The Texas mother of two was diagnosed with a rare and potentially fatal heart condition after having her second child. In addition to avoiding another pregnancy that could be life-threatening, Henderson has to make sure the contraception she uses doesn't jeopardize her health.",
      "For more than a decade, a small team of people at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worked to do just that, issuing national guidelines for clinicians on how to prescribe contraception safely for millions of women with underlying medical conditions \u2014 including heart disease, lupus, sickle cell disease, and obesity. But the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, fired those workers as part of the Trump administration's rapid downsizing of the federal workforce.",
      "It also decimated the CDC's larger Division of Reproductive Health, where the team was housed \u2014 a move that clinicians, advocacy groups, and fired workers say will endanger the health of women and their babies.",
      "Clinicians said in interviews that counseling patients about birth control and prescribing it is relatively straightforward. But for women with conditions that put them at higher risk of serious health complications, special care is needed.",
      "\"We really were the only source of safety monitoring in this country,\" said one fired CDC staffer who worked on the guidelines, known as the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, or MEC. \"There's no one who can actually do this work.\" KFF Health News agreed not to name this worker and others who were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation.",
      "The stakes are high for people like Henderson. About six weeks after having her second baby, she said, her heart \"was racing.\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm underwater,\" Henderson said. \"I felt like I couldn't breathe.\" She eventually went to the hospital, where she was told she was \"in full-blown heart failure,\" she said.",
      "Henderson was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy, an uncommon type of heart failure that can happen toward the end of pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. Risk factors for the condition include being at least 30 years old, being of African descent, high blood pressure, and obesity.",
      "The CDC contraception guidelines say that combined hormonal contraception, which contains both estrogen and progestin to prevent pregnancy, can pose an \"unacceptable health risk\" for most women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, also known as PPCM. For some women with the diagnosis, a birth control injection commonly known by the brand name Depo-Provera also carries risks that outweigh its benefits, the guidelines show. Progestin-only pills or a birth control implant, inserted into a person's arm, are the safest.",
      "Henderson said her cardiologist had to greenlight which contraception she could use. She uses a progestin-only birth control implant that's more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy.",
      "\"I didn't know that certain things can cause blood clots,\" Henderson said, \"or make your heart failure worse.\" Heart failure is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the U.S., with PPCM accounting for up to 70% of heart failure cases during pregnancy.",
      "Sweeping HHS layoffs in late March and early April gutted the CDC's reproductive health division, upending several programs designed to protect women and infants, three fired workers said.",
      "About two-thirds of the division's roughly 165 employees and contractors were cut, through firings, retirements, or reassignments to other parts of the agency, one worker said.",
      "Among those fired were CDC staffers who carried out the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes by asking detailed questions of women who recently gave birth. The survey was used \"to help inform and help reduce the contributing factors that cause maternal mortality and morbidity,\" one fired worker said, by allowing government workers to examine the medical care people received before and during pregnancy, if any, and other risk factors that may lead to poor maternal and child health.",
      "The firings also removed CDC workers who collected and analyzed data on in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments.",
      "\"They left nothing behind,\" one worker said.",
      "U.S. contraception guidelines were first published in 2010, after the CDC adapted guidance developed by the World Health Organization. The latest version was published in August 2024. It includes information about the safety of different types of contraception for more than 60 medical conditions. Clinicians said it is the premier source of evidence about the safety of birth control.",
      "\"It gave us so much information which was not available to clinicians at their fingertips,\" said Michael Policar, a physician and professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine.",
      "\"If you've got a person with, let's say, long-standing Type 2 diabetes, someone who has a connective-tissue disease like lupus, someone who's got hypertension or maybe has been treated for a precursor to breast cancer \u2014 something like that? In those circumstances,\" Policar said, \"before the MEC it was really hard to know how to manage those people.\"",
      "The CDC updates the guidelines comprehensively roughly every five years. On a weekly basis, however, government workers would monitor evidence about patients' use of contraception and the safety of various methods, something they were doing when HHS abruptly fired them this spring, two fired workers said. That work isn't happening now, one of them said.",
      "Sometimes the agency would issue interim changes outside the larger updates if new evidence warranted it. Now, if something new or urgent comes up, \"there's not going to be any way to update the guidelines,\" one fired worker said.",
      "In 2020, for example, the CDC revised its contraception recommendations for women at high risk of HIV infection, after new evidence showed that various methods were safer than previously thought.",
      "HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard declined to say why CDC personnel working on the contraception guidelines and other reproductive health issues were fired, or answer other questions raised by KFF Health News' reporting.",
      "Most women of reproductive age in the U.S. use contraception. CDC data from 2019, the most recent available, shows that more than 47 million women ages 15 to 49 relied on birth control. About 1 in 10 used long-acting methods such as intrauterine devices and implants; 1 in 7 used oral contraception.",
      "The latest guidelines included updated safety recommendations for women who have sickle cell disease, lupus, or PPCM, and those who are breastfeeding, among others. Clinicians are now being told that combined hormonal contraception poses an unacceptable health risk for women with sickle cell disease, because it might increase the risk of blood clots.",
      "\"It can really come down to life or death,\" said Teonna Woolford, CEO of the Sickle Cell Reproductive Health Education Directive, a nonprofit that advocates for improved reproductive health care for people with the disease.",
      "\"We really saw the CDC guidelines as a win, as a victory \u2014 they're actually going to pay attention,\" she said.",
      "The 2024 guidelines also for the first time included birth control recommendations for women with chronic kidney disease. Research has shown that such women are at higher risk of serious pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Their medical condition also increases their risk of blood clots, which is why it's important for them to not use combined hormonal contraception, fired CDC workers and clinicians said.",
      "The CDC information \"is the final say in safety,\" said Patty Cason, a family nurse practitioner and president of Envision Sexual and Reproductive Health. Having only static information about the safety of various types of birth control is \"very scary,\" she said, because new evidence could come out and entirely new methods of contraception are being developed.",
      "Henderson said it took her heart two years to recover. She created the nonprofit organization Let's Talk PPCM to educate women about the type of heart failure she was diagnosed with, including what forms of birth control are safe.",
      "\"We don't want blood clots, worsening heart failures,\" Henderson said. \"They already feel like they can't trust their doctors, and we don't need extra.\"",

    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "Dispute apparently settled",
      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",
      "The different methods \"gave exactly the same age,\" said study author Jonathan O'Neil with the University of Ottawa.",
      "The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Ancient rocks could shed light on Earth's earliest days",
      "Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas soon after the solar system existed. Primordial rocks often get melted and recycled by Earth's moving tectonic plates, making them extremely rare on the surface today. Scientists have uncovered 4 billion-year-old rocks from another formation in Canada called the Acasta Gneiss Complex, but the Nuvvuagittuq rocks could be even older.",
      "Studying rocks from Earth's earliest history could give a glimpse into how the planet may have looked - how its roiling magma oceans gave way to tectonic plates - and even how life got started.",

    "summary": "A new observatory in Chile has produced a stunningly detailed image of a nebula resembling cotton candy, using the largest telescope in the world.",
    "story": [
      "The world's largest telescope captured a deep-space nebula \u2014 an interstellar cloud of gas and dust that can produce new stars \u2014 in stunning detail, providing the first close-up view to date of the cosmic phenomenon.",
      "Scientists recently unveiled images from Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a new station located in the Andes Mountains of Chile and funded by the United States, which houses a powerful telescope containing the biggest digital camera on the planet.",
      "Its precision allows the telescope to peer far into space, with galaxies tens of millions of light-years away from Earth among the subjects of the observatory's debut portraits of cosmos. Also pictured is the \"cotton candy\" nebula, which earned that nickname because of its bright pink and blue pattern.",
      "Officially, the swirling mass is called the Trifid Nebula, and it exists about 5,000 light-years from Earth, according to the Rubin Observatory. Nearby is the Lagoon Nebula, another colorful cloud, which is located about 4,000 light-years away and appears alongside Trifid in the observatory's latest images. Both are in the constellation Sagittarius, according to the Rubin Observatory.",
      "Zoomed-in views of the nebulae are seen in a video shared by the observatory, showcasing the Trifid and Lagoon formations at a scale never seen before. The composite image was created from more than 678 different exposures taken over a 7-hour period by the camera that powers the observatory's massive telescope.",
      "The telescope's long-term mission is set to begin later this year, when it will perform nightly scans of the sky for the next decade in an effort to learn more about the early universe and some of its properties that still are not well-understood, like dark energy.",
      "Brian Stone, the chief of staff at the National Science Foundation who currently performs the duties of the foundation's director, said in a statement that the Rubin Observatory is expected to \"capture more information about our Universe than all optical telescopes throughout history combined.\"",
      "\"Through this remarkable scientific facility, we will explore many cosmic mysteries, including the dark matter and dark energy that permeate the Universe,\" his statement said.",

    "story": [
      "Blue Origin launched six astrotourists to the edge of space and back Sunday, a 10-minute ride marking the Jeff Bezos-owned company's 13th passenger flight out of the discernible atmosphere.",
      "The New Shepard capsule's stubby single-stage booster roared to life just after 9:38 a.m. EDT, throttled up to full thrust and smoothly climbed away from Blue Origin's launch site near Van Horn, Texas.",
      "Liftoff came eight days later than originally planned due to high winds in the West Texas desert, but the weather met Blue Origin's safety requirements on Sunday.",
      "The hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine powering the New Shepard fired for about two-and-a-half minutes, accelerating the spacecraft to just under three times the speed of sound. The capsule then separated from the booster and continued coasting upward along its up-and-down trajectory.",
      "At that point, the passengers \u2013 Allie and Carl Kuehner, Leland Larson, Freddie Rescigno Jr., Jim Sitkin and Owolabi Salis, the first Nigerian to fly in space \u2013 began enjoying about three minutes of weightlessness.",
      "Free to unstrap and float about the cabin, the passengers were able to take in the view through the largest windows in any operational spacecraft as the ship climbed to an altitude of just above 65 miles. That's about three miles higher than the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The capsule then began falling back to Earth and the passengers returned to their seats for the descent to touchdown. The reusable booster, meanwhile, made its own return to the launch site, dropping tail first to a rocket-powered touchdown.",
      "Floating under three red-and-blue parachutes, the New Shepard capsule touched down a stone's throw from the booster's concrete landing pad, closer than any previous landing. Blue Origin said that it was the result of \"low winds ... and within the safety margins of our predicted models.\"",
      "Blue Origin has now launched 13 passenger flights since the sub-orbital spacecraft carried Amazon and Blue Origin founder Bezos and three others aloft in July 2021. The company has now launched 74 passengers, including Bezos' wife Lauren S\u00e1nchez, and four who have flown twice.",
      "Blue Origin and its passengers do not reveal how much it costs to fly aboard a New Shepard, but it's thought to be more than $500,000 per seat.",
      "The company has had the sub-orbital passenger market to itself since June 2024, when competitor Virgin Galactic, founded by entrepreneur Richard Branson, retired its original rocketplane to focus on building two upgraded Delta-class spacecraft. Virgin is expected to resume flights next year.",

      "The American Meteor Society said it received more than 160 reports of a fireball sighting from observers in Georgia and South Carolina at 12:25 p.m. ET. The meteor was first seen at an altitude of 48 miles above the town of Oxford, Georgia, moving southwest at 30,000 miles per hour, said Bill Cooke, a lead at NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office.",
      "The fireball later exploded 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, unleashing an energy of about 20 tons of TNT. Cooke said the fireball was 3 feet in diameter and weighed more than a ton (2,000 pounds).",
      "\"The resulting pressure wave propagated to the ground, creating booms heard by many in that area,\" Cooke said in a statement.",
      "When a space rock enters the atmosphere on its own and burns up, it's called a meteor. It's a meteorite if it survives the trip and makes contact with the ground before burning up. Those that appear especially bright are called fireballs, according to NASA.",
      "This daylight fireball on Thursday could be a member of the Beta Taurid meteor shower, which includes meteors that are rarely seen and are typically active from late June to early July, peaking around June 25, said Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"I would estimate that we receive reports of one daylight event per month from all over the world,\" Lunsford told CBS News. \"I would say one out [of] every 700 fireball events involves a fireball seen during daylight hours. So these events are rare, and most people go a lifetime without seeing one.\"",

      "Usually, planets of this size outside our solar system are difficult to detect, but scientists used a technique called high-contrast imaging to detect the exoplanet, NASA said. Images of the exoplanet were taken using a coronagraph, which allows researchers to suppress the bright glare of a star to reveal faint nearby objects.",
      "Scientists said there was a very small chance the images could show a background galaxy, but evidence \"strongly points to the source being a previously undiscovered planet.\"",
      "\"Our observations reveal a strong candidate for a planet shaping the structure of the TWA 7 debris disk, and its position is exactly where we expected to find a planet of this mass,\" lead researcher Anne-Marie Lagrange said.",

      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books.

      "In the letter, portions of which were shown to CBS News by Mogen's father, Ben Mogen, the Latah County Prosecutor's Office says attorneys for Kohberger requested a plea deal and Kohberger accepted it.",
      "The letter says Kohberger agreed to plead guilty to      all the counts against him and that he would be sentenced to \"four consecutive (back to back) life sentences on the four Murder counts\" and would waive all rights to appeal.",
      "The letter also says that if Kohberger \"enters guilty pleas as expected\" at an upcoming hearing, \"we anticipate that this case will be set for sentencing in late July. If Defendant does not enter guilty pleas as expected, we are prepared to proceed to trial as planned.\"",
      "The family of one of the other victims, Kaylee Goncalves, also said they received the letter about the plea deal.",
      "A hearing in the case has been scheduled for Wednesday.",
      "Kohberger had been fighting the charges. His trial was expected to begin in August, following several delays.",
      "The murders terrorized the community, and for weeks, the hunt for a suspect was shrouded in mystery. Kohberger was arrested six weeks later at his parents' home in Pennsylvania. According to a police affidavit, DNA evidence linked him to a knife sheath found at the crime scene.",

      "The Goncalves family, however, said they \"are beyond furious at the State of Idaho\" in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0shortly after the news broke. \"They have failed us. ... This was very unexpected,\" they wrote.",
      "The family said the Latah County Prosecutor's Office \"vaguely mentioned a possible plea on Friday, without seeking our input, and presented the plea on Sunday.\" The family has pushed for Kohberger to face the death penalty.",
      "\"The introduction of this plea deal, just weeks before the scheduled trial, is both shocking and cruel,\" Aubrie Goncalves, the youngest member of the family, wrote in a letter shared on Facebook. \"Bryan Kohberger facing a life in prison means he would still get to speak, form relationships, and engage with the world. Meanwhile, our loved ones have been silenced forever.\"",
      "In another statement\u00a0released Tuesday, the Goncalves family said they \"will not stop fighting for the life that was stolen unjustly.\"",
      "\"We stand strong that it is not over until a plea is accepted,\" they wrote. \"At a bare minimum, please - require a full confession, full accountability, location of the murder weapon, confirmation the defendant acted alone, & the true facts of what happened that night.\"",
      "Martin Souto Diaz, an attorney for the Kohberger family, said in a statement provided to CBS News Tuesday evening on behalf of the family that, \"In light of recent developments, the Kohbergers are asking members of the media for privacy, respect, and responsible judgement during this time. We will continue to allow the legal process to unfold with respect to all parties, and will not release any comments or take any questions.\"",
      "The trial was originally going to be held in Latah County, where the murders occurred, but Latah County District Judge John Judge later ordered the trial be moved over concerns the media coverage and statements from local officials would make it impossible for Kohberger to receive a fair trial. The Idaho Supreme Court moved the proceedings to Boise.",
      "Kohberger's defense team had previously tried to remove the death penalty as a possible sentence if he was convicted, but Ada County Judge Steven Hippler denied their motions back in November 2024.",
      "Among the evidence prosecutors were planning to present was Kohberger's Amazon purchase history showing he bought a Ka-Bar knife with sheath and sharpener, which they claimed matched the sheath found at the crime scene. Prosecutors also claimed \"touch DNA\" matching DNA taken from Kohberger was found on the sheath. The defense tried to exclude the touch DNA evidence, but Hippler denied that request.",
      "Prosecutors were also planning to present surveillance video of Kohberger's car and cellphone data that they said tied him to the vicinity of the killings.",

      "Coco Gauff became just the third woman in the Open era to lose in the first round at Wimbledon right after winning the championship at the French Open, eliminated 7-6 (3), 6-1 by unseeded Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine on Tuesday night.",
      "The No. 2-ranked Gauff made mistake after mistake at No. 1 Court, finishing with just six winners and a total of 29 unforced errors that included nine double-faults.",
      "\"Dayana started off playing strong,\" Gauff said. \"I couldn't find my footing out there today.\"",
      "She joined another highly seeded American, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, in bowing out on Day 2 of the tournament. In all, 23 seeds \u2014 13 men and 10 women \u2014 already are gone before the first round is even done, tying the most at any Grand Slam tournament since they began seeding 32 players in each singles bracket in 2001.",
      "It was just a little more than three weeks ago that Gauff was celebrating her second Grand Slam title by getting past No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final on the red clay of Roland-Garros.",
      "The quick turnaround might have been an issue, Gauff acknowledged.",
      "\"I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards,\" said the 21-year-old Gauff, \"so I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it.\"",
      "She didn't think it mattered Tuesday that their match location was shifted from Centre Court to Court No. 1 or that she was told about a new start time only about an hour before the contest began.",
      "Even though Gauff's big breakthrough came at the All England Club at age 15 in 2019, when she beat Venus Williams in her opening match and made it all the way to the fourth round, the grass-court tournament has proved to be her least successful major.",
      "It's the only Slam where Gauff hasn't made at least the semifinals.",
      "Indeed, she has yet to get past the fourth round and now has been sent home in the first round twice in the past three years.",
      "The transition from clay to grass has proven tough for most players, and the last woman to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same season was Serena Williams a decade ago.",
      "Still, since the Open era began in 1968, only Justine Henin in 2005 and Francesca Schiavone in 2010 went from holding the trophy in Paris to exiting immediately in London.",
      "Gauff was never quite at her best Tuesday against Yastremska, who had lost all three of their previous matchups and currently is ranked 42nd.",
      "A particular problem for Gauff, as it often is, was her serving. She managed to put only 45% of her first serves in play, won 14 of her 32 second-serve points and had all of those double-faults, including a pair in the tiebreaker and another when she got broken to open the second set.",
      "\"When I can serve well, and some games I did, it's definitely an added threat,\" Gauff said. \"I didn't serve that well.\"",
      "Yastremska's best Grand Slam result was making it all the way to the semifinals on the Australian Open's hard courts last year, although she entered this event with a record of only 10-11 in first-round matches at majors.",
      "Gauff, by contrast, was 20-3 at that stage, including a loss to Sofia Kenin at Wimbledon in 2023.",
      "Yastremska's deepest run at Wimbledon was making the fourth round in 2019, although she did get to the final of the junior event in 2016.",
      "\"I was really on fire,\" said Yastremska, who accumulated 16 winners. \"Playing against Coco, it is something special.\"",
      "She recently reached her first tournament final on grass, at a smaller event in Nottingham, which she said gave her confidence heading to the All England Club.",

    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial in New York City said it reached a partial verdict in the case, but the judge told them they need to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "The jurors sent a note to the judge late Tuesday afternoon saying they'd reached a verdict on four of the five counts but were unable to agree on count 1, racketeering conspiracy. The note indicated there are jurors with unpersuadable opinions on that charge.",
      "After discussing the options with attorneys for both sides, Judge Arun Subramanian asked the jury to keep deliberating on the remaining charge, which is what prosecutors and defense attorneys asked for.",
      "Court then ended for the day. The jury will return to continue deliberations at 9 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "After the note from the jury was brought to court, Combs was seated with his attorneys surrounding him standing in a half-circle. Combs appeared to be praying with his head bowed and hands folded on his lap. Combs wiped and rubbed his eyes, but it wasn't clear if he was crying.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday.",
      "What are the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "A sweeping grand jury indictment against Combs, 55, was unsealed in September 2024, initially charging the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at an upscale midtown Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges against Combs in a superseding indictment, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "The charges against Combs are one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs pleaded not guilty to the charges. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs' attorneys didn't call him or any witnesses to testify in his defense during the trial. Combs told Judge Subramanian that he decided not to testify, saying: \"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it.\" His lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Combs, and the defense sought an acquittal after the prosecution rested.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" and \"hotel nights\"",
      "The high-profile trial started in May. The proceedings included graphic and emotional testimony, including from singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' former girlfriend who spent more than a decade with him.",
      "Ventura testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura said in court that Combs directed all the encounters, which could last for days. She said Combs would decide who participated, what she could wear and the role she was expected to play. She testified that she felt forced to participate in the \"freak-offs\" to make Combs happy.",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual, and during cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Last year, CNN aired surveillance video from 2016 showing what appears to be Combs assaulting Ventura at a California hotel. Combs apologized at the time, and said his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and he takes \"full responsibility\" for his actions. Ventura testified during the trial that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly settled with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Singer Dawn Richard, who was part of two bands tied to Combs, testified that she often saw Combs being violent toward Ventura. She said that after one incident in 2009, Combs allegedly threatened her and a bandmate, saying they could go missing if they didn't stay quiet.",
      "The defense focused on inconsistencies in Richard's testimony, and she said it takes time to remember things she tried to forget. Separately, Richard has made allegations against Combs in a civil lawsuit, accusing him of physical and psychological abuse, which he has denied.",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym Jane in court. During their relationship between 2021 and 2024, she told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched.",
      "She said she told Combs she didn't like the \"hotel nights.\" Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting them up. Jane said she felt pressured to meet her partner's expectations and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "Jane said she got into a fight with Combs last year over another woman. She said she slammed his head on a marble table and he allegedly grabbed her by the neck, punched and kicked her.",

      "Read on to find which cities have the most to offer U.S. workers.",
      "Which cities have the best overall job market?",
      "Bend, Oregon, has the top job market in the United States, according to SmartAsset. The West Coast city notched points for its low unemployment rate (3.1%) and high income growth. From 2020 to 2023, the median income in Bend grew 44% \u2014 the fourth highest rate after Richmond, Virginia, (50%); Nampa, Idaho, (47%); and Dayton, Ohio, (45%).",
      "A hub for outdoor recreation, Bend also stands out for its work-life balance. The median commute time for workers in Bend is 16 minutes, with just over a quarter of the city's population working remotely.",
      "Trailing Bend in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots for best overall job markets are Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington.",
      "Which cities have the highest percentage of health care coverage for workers?",
      "For workers looking for solid health care coverage, a move to Santa Clara, California, may be worth considering. Over 88% of the population in the southern Bay Area city have private health insurance plans through their employer. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Bellevue, Washington, follow close behind with roughly 87% of their residents having health coverage through their employers.",
      "Which cities have the shortest commutes?",
      "Spending large chunks of time sitting on a train or stuck in traffic is not conducive to good work-life balance. For that reason, cities with the shortest commute times contribute to top job market rankings in SmartAssets' study.",
      "With a median commute time of roughly 14 minutes, workers in Wichita Falls, Texas, have one the shortest commute times in the country, according SmartAsset. Abilene, Texas, and Topeka, Kansas, workers also spend less time in transit than others, with median commutes of around 14 and 15 minutes, respectively.",
      "Which cities are remote-work friendly?",
      "When it comes to cities with the highest percentage of remote workers, Frisco, Texas, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro, stands out from the crowd, with over 32% of workers conducting their jobs remotely.

    "summary": "A federal judge in Rhode Island has blocked the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing mass layoffs and overhauling some of its sub-agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island has blocked the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing mass layoffs and overhauling some of its sub-agencies, finding there to be \"no rational basis\" for the Trump administration's reorganization plans that would have \"devastating consequences\" across the country if enacted.",
      "The suit was brought by 19 Democratic attorneys general and Washington, D.C., in May, seeking to block an agency restructuring plan announced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in March.",
      "Their complaint warned of \"severe, complicated, and potentially irreversible\" consequences to public health services nationwide if the plan went forward, potentially \"paralyzing\" the agency \"by means of a confusing reorganization.\"",
      "\"Critical public health services have been interrupted, databases taken offline, status of grants thrown into chaos, technical assistance services gone, and training and consultation services curtailed. These are not unsubstantiated fears,\" Judge Melissa DuBose wrote in her opinion granting the states' request for a preliminary injunction.",
      "\"HHS has failed to produce a shred of evidence that services to States and access to critical information would continue uninterrupted, that the harms are minimal or not irreparable, or that it is authorized to act absent Congressional action,\" she added.",
      "The judge also ordered the parties to address whether and how the Supreme Court's recent ruling limiting universal injunctions should apply to her order. In that case, which stemmed from President Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court limited the use of universal injunctions in cases with individuals as plaintiffs, but gave lower courts more latitude in cases brought by states.",
      "The states had cited concerns with the restructuring at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA's tobacco products center, the Office of Head Start and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",
      "\"The Executive Branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\" DuBose wrote.",
      "As part of Kennedy's restructuring plan, he moved to lay off some 10,000 employees at the nation's health agencies and ordered remaining officials to draw up plans to reorganize their work. Several offices and teams are slated to move under the plans, many into a new agency Kennedy wants to create called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA.",
      "Most of those employees remain off the job after getting their layoff notices in April but are still being paid, due to cases that sought to block their terminations.",
      "\"HHS is the backbone of our nation's public health and social safety net \u2014 from cancer screenings and maternal health to early childhood education and domestic violence prevention,\" said New York Attorney General James in a statement after the ruling.",
      "In May, a federal court in California blocked the Trump administration's mass layoff attempts, including at HHS, though the Supreme Court is considering whether to lift a lower court's injunction and allow it to move forward with the administration's plans for reductions in force, or layoffs.",
      "\"The people who were subject to the reduction in force are on administrative leave, and they will remain on administrative leave until the injunction is lifted,\" Kennedy said at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said planning has been ongoing for the next steps of the reorganization and merger, even as Kennedy has cited the court rulings as a reason to dodge questions about the restructuring on Capitol Hill.",
      "Officials from the Health Resources and Services Administration visited the CDC's campuses in Atlanta in recent weeks, they said, in a meeting of senior leaders between the two agencies.",
      "Most remaining teams focused on chronic disease from the two agencies are supposed to start being transferred into the new AHA agency, Kennedy has said, if the injunction is lifted.",
      "A few hundred layoffs have also been reversed in the weeks since the initial cuts, including those of scientists, researchers and health officials the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the FDA.",
      "But officials have also been told that further layoffs might be demanded by the Trump administration from health agencies in order to \"balance out\" the jobs that were restored.",
      "\"At that point, we will make decisions. And, you know, in some cases, there have been gaps in our ability to perform our duties. I've brought people back,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

    "story": [
      "Dharamshala, India \u2014 The Dalai Lama said Wednesday that the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that started when he indicated he might be the last person to hold the role. His having a successor would mean he would be reincarnated.",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism said at prayer celebrations ahead of his upcoming 90th birthday that the next Dalai Lama should be found and recognized as per past Buddhist traditions, while signaling that China should stay away from the process of identifying his successor.",
      "The Dalai Lama's succession plan is politically consequential for most Tibetans who oppose China's tight control of Tibet and have struggled to keep their identity alive, in their homeland or in exile. It is also profound for Tibetan Buddhists who worship him as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion.",
      "The decision, however, is expected to irk China, which has repeatedly said that it alone has the authority to approve the next religious leader. It insists the reincarnated figure must be found in China's Tibetan areas, giving Communist authorities power over who is chosen.",
      "Many observers believe there eventually will be rival Dalai Lamas - one appointed by Beijing, and one by senior monks loyal to the current Dalai Lama.",
      "And China said Wednesday that the Dalai Lama's reincarnation \"approved by the central government,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news briefing.",
      "Tenzin Gyatso became the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959 and has been living in the town of Dharamshala in India since then, helping establish a democratic government-in-exile while also traveling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people.",
      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China.",
      "The Dalai Lama laid out his succession plan in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in Dharamshala. He said the process of finding and recognizing his reincarnation lies solely with the Gaden Phodrang Trust - a non-profit he founded in 2015 that oversees matters related to the spiritual leader and the institute of the Dalai Lama.",
      "\"No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,\" he said, adding that the search for a future Dalai Lama should be carried out in \"accordance with past tradition.\"",
      "The Dalai Lama has often urged his followers to reject anyone chosen by Beijing. The self-proclaimed Tibetan government-in-exile he once headed before relinquishing his political role in 2011 also supports this stance.",
      "Penpa Tsering, the president of the government-in-exile, said Tibetans from around the world made \"an earnest request with single-minded devotion\" that the position of the Dalai Lama should continue \"for the benefit of all sentient beings in general and Buddhist in particular.\"",
      "\"In response to this overwhelming supplication, His Holiness has shown infinite compassion and finally agreed to accept our appeal on this special occasion of his 90th birthday,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Tsering, however, warned China not to meddle in the process of the Dalai Lama's succession, saying it is a \"unique Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\"",
      "\"We not only strongly condemn the People's Republic of China's usage of reincarnation subject for their political gain, and will never accept it,\" he said.",
      "The search for a Dalai Lama's reincarnation begins only upon the incumbent's death.",
      "In the past, the successor has been identified by senior monastic disciples, based on spiritual signs and visions, and it can take several years after the next Dalai Lama is identified as a baby and groomed to take the reins.",

      "Coco Gauff became just the third woman in the Open era to lose in the first round at Wimbledon right after winning the championship at the French Open, eliminated 7-6 (3), 6-1 by unseeded Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine on Tuesday night.",
      "The No. 2-ranked Gauff made mistake after mistake at No. 1 Court, finishing with just six winners and a total of 29 unforced errors that included nine double-faults.",
      "\"Dayana started off playing strong,\" Gauff said. \"I couldn't find my footing out there today.\"",
      "She joined another highly seeded American, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, in bowing out on Day 2 of the tournament. In all, 23 seeds \u2014 13 men and 10 women \u2014 already are gone before the first round is even done, tying the most at any Grand Slam tournament since they began seeding 32 players in each singles bracket in 2001.",
      "It was just a little more than three weeks ago that Gauff was celebrating her second Grand Slam title by getting past No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final on the red clay of Roland-Garros.",
      "The quick turnaround might have been an issue, Gauff acknowledged.",
      "\"I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards,\" said the 21-year-old Gauff, \"so I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it.\"",
      "She didn't think it mattered Tuesday that their match location was shifted from Centre Court to Court No. 1 or that she was told about a new start time only about an hour before the contest began.",
      "Even though Gauff's big breakthrough came at the All England Club at age 15 in 2019, when she beat Venus Williams in her opening match and made it all the way to the fourth round, the grass-court tournament has proved to be her least successful major.",
      "It's the only Slam where Gauff hasn't made at least the semifinals.",
      "Indeed, she has yet to get past the fourth round and now has been sent home in the first round twice in the past three years.",
      "The transition from clay to grass has proven tough for most players, and the last woman to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same season was Serena Williams a decade ago.",
      "Still, since the Open era began in 1968, only Justine Henin in 2005 and Francesca Schiavone in 2010 went from holding the trophy in Paris to exiting immediately in London.",
      "Gauff was never quite at her best Tuesday against Yastremska, who had lost all three of their previous matchups and currently is ranked 42nd.",
      "A particular problem for Gauff, as it often is, was her serving. She managed to put only 45% of her first serves in play, won 14 of her 32 second-serve points and had all of those double-faults, including a pair in the tiebreaker and another when she got broken to open the second set.",
      "\"When I can serve well, and some games I did, it's definitely an added threat,\" Gauff said. \"I didn't serve that well.\"",
      "Yastremska's best Grand Slam result was making it all the way to the semifinals on the Australian Open's hard courts last year, although she entered this event with a record of only 10-11 in first-round matches at majors.",
      "Gauff, by contrast, was 20-3 at that stage, including a loss to Sofia Kenin at Wimbledon in 2023.",
      "Yastremska's deepest run at Wimbledon was making the fourth round in 2019, although she did get to the final of the junior event in 2016.",
      "\"I was really on fire,\" said Yastremska, who accumulated 16 winners. \"Playing against Coco, it is something special.\"",
      "She recently reached her first tournament final on grass, at a smaller event in Nottingham, which she said gave her confidence heading to the All England Club.",
      "\"I love playing on grass. I feel that this year we are kind of friends,\" Yastremska said with a laugh. \"I hope the road will continue for me here.\"",

      "The CCRC has given no date for when a decision might be reached.",

      "President Trump recently indicated diplomatic talks with Iran could restart as soon as this week, although the White House noted no talks were officially scheduled. After U.S. airstrikes on some of Iran's nuclear facilities, followed days later by a\u00a0ceasefire to end what Mr. Trump called the\u00a012-day war between Iran and Israel, Iran's foreign minister seemed less certain about a speedy return to diplomacy.",
      "\"I don't think negotiations will restart as quickly as that,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS News through a translator.",
      "\"In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations,\" Araghchi said in his first interview with an American media outlet inside Iran since the bombings. \"And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time.\"",
      "However, Araghchi also insisted, \"The doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.\"",

      "When asked if Iran intends to continue enriching uranium, Araghchi said the country's \"peaceful nuclear program has turned into a matter of national pride and glory. We have also gone through 12 days of imposed war, therefore, people will not easily back down from enrichment.\"",
      "After 12 days of missile exchanges between Iran and Israel, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared victory, writing on social media, \"I offer my congratulations on the victory over the fallacious Zionist regime,\" and claiming Israel's government was \"practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.\"",

      "Separate cases in Georgia and Massachusetts represent the latest Justice Department effort to confront a persistent threat that officials say generates enormous revenue for the North Korean government and in some cases affords workers access to sensitive and proprietary data from the American corporations that hire them.",
      "The scheme involved thousands of workers who, armed with stolen or fake identities, were dispatched by the North Korean government to find work as remote IT employees at American companies, including Fortune 500 corporations. The companies were duped into believing that the workers they hired were based in the U.S. when many were actually stationed in North Korea or China, and the wages the victimized companies paid were transferred into accounts controlled by co-conspirators affiliated with North Korea, prosecutors say.",
      "On Monday, U.S. prosecutors announced the arrest of U.S. national Zhenxing \"Danny\" Wang of New Jersey. A five-count indictment describes a \"multi-year fraud scheme by Wang and his co-conspirators to obtain remote IT work with U.S. companies that generated more than $5 million in revenue,\" the Justice Department said.",

      "\"These schemes target and steal from U.S. companies and are designed to evade sanctions and fund the North Korean regime's illicit programs, including its weapons programs,\" Assistant Attorney General John Eisenberg, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said in a statement.",

      "The conspiracy, court papers say, involved the registration of financial accounts to receive the proceeds and the creation of shell companies and fake websites to make it look like the remote workers were associated with legitimate businesses. Enablers inside the United States facilitated the workers' remote computer access, tricking companies into believing the workers were logging in from U.S. locations.",
      "The Justice Department did not identify the companies that were duped, but said that some of the fraudulent workers were able to gain access to and steal information related to sensitive military technology.",
      "The case filed in Georgia charges four North Korean IT workers with stealing virtual currency worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from their employers. The defendants remain at large.",
      "The Justice Department has filed similar prosecutions in recent years, as well as created an initiative aimed at disrupting the threat.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other people living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government.",

      "In May 2024, federal prosecutors\u00a0accused\u00a0an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies.

      "The charges relate to eight alleged victims from one child care centre in the Melbourne suburb of Point Cook, between April 2022 and January 2023, but authorities fear more children may have been affected.

      "A jury at Bristol crown court found Ryland Headley, then aged 34, guilty of attacking 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in June 1967. He was sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday.",
      "\"Louisa Dunne died in a horrifying attack carried out in the place where she should have felt safest \u2014 her own home,\" prosecutor Charlotte Ream said. \"For 58 years, this appalling crime went unsolved and Ryland Headley, the man we now know is responsible, avoided justice.\"",
      "Dunne was found dead in her home by a neighbor on June 28, 1967. The night of her death, neighbors reported hearing a woman's \"frightening scream,\" the BBC reported.",
      "The cause of her death was found to be strangulation and asphyxiation. She had also been raped.",
      "It is \"one of the oldest cold cases to ever be solved in the U.K.,\"\u00a0said the Crown Prosecution Service\u00a0(CPS), which brings criminal prosecutions.",

      "After passing sentence, judge Derek Sweeting told Headley: \"You will never be released, you will die in prison.\"",
      "Investigators retained Dunne's clothing, including a blue skirt, and other samples from her body for further examination. They also recovered a palm print from a window which Headley is believed to have used to gain entry to her home.",
      "Despite the efforts of police investigating Dunne's death 58 years ago, no key suspect was identified, the BBC reported. Police collected about 19,000 prints from men and boys at the time with no success.",
      "In 2023, the case was reexamined and the skirt was sent away for forensic testing in May last year. DNA recovered from the item of clothing linked Headley to the murder scene after his DNA was added to the national database in 2012 for an unrelated incident.",
      "Forensic scientists concluded that DNA from the skirt matched Headley's and the palm print was also his. Headley was arrested at his home in Suffolk in November.",
      "Headley was convicted of two counts of rape in the late 1970s, after he attacked women, aged 79 and 84, in Ipswich. He pleaded guilty to the charges in 1978 and was jailed for seven years.",
      "All but one of the trial witnesses in the case died, according to the CPS, so the prosecution had to rely on written accounts taken from witnesses at the time of the murder.",
      "Testimonies of the two women were read during Headley's 2025 trial.",
      "\"Hearing the voices of the victims of his 1977 offences, is just incredibly powerful and harrowing,\" said Detective Inspector Dave Marchant, senior investigating officer for the case. \"I think it gives us an insight into probably what happened within 58 Britannia Road (Dunne's home) to some degree.\"",
      "Because witnesses were not available to give evidence in court, and therefore could not be challenged on that evidence, their statements had to be treated as hearsay evidence instead, the CPS noted.",
      "Dunne's granddaughter Mary Dainton said she was stunned when she heard that Headley had been arrested. \"I accepted that some murders just never get solved and some people have to live with that emptiness and sadness,\" she said.",
      "Marchant said he is working with the National Crime Agency to determine whether Headley may be responsible for any other unsolved offenses over the years. \"Crimes of this magnitude should never go unpunished and we will remain relentless in ensuring we do everything we can to advance other unsolved murder cases in the Avon and Somerset area,\" he said.",

      "Diddy's defense played \"high stakes poker\" by not calling witnesses to the stand, experts say. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Usually, when defense does not call witnesses, that defendant is called an inmate,\" Gowdy explained. \"I've said that my entire career. That's a fancy way of calling someone an inmate. You gotta give the jury a reason for reasonable doubt and to simply say the prosecution hasn\u2019t met its burden \u2026 most jurors don\u2019t really understand what that burden is.\"",
      "He added, \"Gotta give the jury a reason for doubt\u00a0and if you don't put up a very significant defense, all you do is cross-examine government witnesses, then you're going to be an inmate.\"",

      "Diddy told the court last week that it was his decision not to testify in his sex crimes case. The judge asked if Diddy understood he had the right to testify or not testify, and if he had discussed his rights with his attorney. Diddy responded, \"Yes, thoroughly,\" before admitting it was \"solely my decision\" to not testify in his sex crimes trial.",
      "Jurors began deliberating on Monday, June 30, and of the five counts, could not agree on a verdict for the racketeering charge, one of the most serious counts against the disgraced music mogul.

      "\"Was Diddy's high-flying and maybe disturbing lifestyle just that, or can you really pick out a criminal enterprise that is the equivalent of an organized crime family?\" Day said. \"But tomorrow morning the judge will be hoping that after a night of thinking about it, the jurors will have second thoughts about a split verdict on RICO \u2014 one way or the other \u2014 and come back with a unanimous verdict on that most serious charge.\"",

      "\"So what happens is now they're forced to go back in there, and there's probably going to be a lot of frustration back there, more fighting back and forth,\" Becker said. \"My understanding is that the jurors' verbiage was something to the effect of that they're at a point where there's unpersuadable opinions on both sides. So clearly some of the jurors thinking, 'Well, obviously he's guilty.'\"",
      "The judge instructed the jury to continue deliberating for now. A second option would be to give supplemental jury instructions. Lastly, the jury could return a partial verdict.

      "He added, \"At this point, it\u2019s unclear whether the partial verdict could give rise to any grounds for appeal.\"",
      "The government emphasized in their argument that Diddy ran an alleged criminal enterprise with full control. The prosecution pointed out that the jury heard testimony, saw texts, viewed bank records and heard audio allegedly showing the \"Last Night\" rapper committing crime after crime for decades.",
      "According to the prosecution, the government showed Diddy didn\u2019t take no for an answer. \"Up until today, Diddy was able to get away with crime because of money and power,\"\u00a0Assistant U.S. Attorney Christine Slavik said. \"That stops now.\"",

      "\"It seems the jury has struggled and spent most of their time debating the more serious and complex racketeering count,\" Bassett noted. \"If I was the defense, I\u2019d be concerned, but you never know what a jury will do. For this lengthy of a trial, a 13-hour deliberation is on the short side of expectations.\"",

      "\"Both sides stated that they do not want to accept a partial verdict,\" attorney David S. Seltzer told Fox News Digital. \"This forces the jury to render a complete verdict, which ultimately could lead to a hung jury on the count at issue if they cannot render a verdict on all counts, and thus lead to a possible retrial on the hung count.",

A federal RICO violation can result in a 20-year sentence. The transportation to engage in prostitution charge could carry a sentence of up to 10 years, while sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion may carry a 20-year sentence.",
      "There are three options now left for the jury. The judge instructed the jury to continue deliberating for now. A second option would be to give supplemental jury instructions.

Further: Without that sexual activity, will the drug and weapons allegations suffice to demonstrate an actual racketeering entity?

      "Problems within the jury could have been avoided, according to attorney David S. Seltzer, who told Fox News Digital that simply sequestering the jurors throughout the duration of the seven-week trial could have prevented additional issues reaching a verdict.",
      "\"I don\u2019t see how people are not influenced by outside factors,\"\u00a0Seltzer said. \"We live in a technology world where everyone wants their information now.\u00a0I know the jury was instructed not to read anything, but I don\u2019t think that was realistic given the length of the trial.\"",
      "Seltzer noted that not sequestering the jury was a mistake. \"I have been saying from day one that it is impossible to tell people to stay off media and/or computers for six weeks-plus, when people are addicted to their devices.\u00a0I think the court is relying on the admonishment, but respectfully turning a blind eye.\"",

      "\"Courts will always push a jury to get to a unanimous verdict, but at the end of the day, it is up to the jury if they think they can get there,\"\u00a0Seltzer noted. \"Often times when there are issues within the jury, they cannot get there, and it ends up in a hung jury.\"",

      "While sequestering a jury \u2014 essentially isolating the 12 jurors and six alternates assigned to the case from the outside world \u2014 can be challenging, the process may prove to be essential in eliminating external influences.",

      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"Unfortunately, courts are reluctant to utilize one of the few tools historically used to inoculate jurors against external sources of information during a trial or deliberations \u2014 sequestration,\" DerOhannesian said. \"We did see sequestration of the jury in the Casey Anthony and OJ Simpson trials.\u00a0Sequestration in a federal trial is virtually non-existent in recent history.\"",

      "\"I think the lack of sequestration favors the defense,\" Seltzer told Fox News Digital. \"The media/coverage in the Karen Read trial, as I saw it, was pro-defense.\u00a0The trial was very technical and not something that favors a prosecution case.\u00a0The Diddy trial, while not technical, it was much of the same from all the witnesses and the media was not very favorable to the prosecution in meeting their burden.\"",
      "DerOhannesian said he wouldn't \"necessarily compare the Combs and Read trials. However, I would note Read benefited from some favorable publicity and information, particularly concerning the integrity of the investigation.\"",

      "\"Their lives and priorities have diverged dramatically since Harry decided to depart from royal duties.

      "\"As for whether William is jealous of Harry\u2019s freedom... if he is, he\u2019d never phrase it that way,\" said Matta. \"He\u2019s too rooted in the idea of his duty to openly admit wanting anything else. But you can see hints of that in how he\u2019s quietly carving out more space for his personal life, seizing more privacy for his wife and kids and taking more control over his platform. He may not want Harry\u2019s lifestyle, but he\u2019s taken note of what boundaries look like from his brother.\"",

      "While BMI is easy to calculate, one of its main limitations is that it cannot distinguish between muscle and fat mass, the researchers noted.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration approved millions in disaster relief loans for small businesses that were rocked by the anti-ICE riots that plagued Los Angeles in June after Gov. Gavin Newsom downplayed the riots and blamed the violence on the Trump administration, Fox News Digital exclusively learned on Tuesday.",
      "Small Business Administration chief Kelly Loeffler announced in a press release first shared with Fox News Digital on Tuesday that Newsom's government had applied for an SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) declaration, which the administration quickly approved. Small businesses are now able to apply for up to $2 million in low-interest EIDL loans \"to support working capital and normal operating expenses such as payroll, rent, and utilities that could not be met due to the destruction enabled by Newsom\u2019s failed governance,\" according to the SBA.",
      "\"Governor Newsom allowed a mob to rampage Los Angeles \u2013 standing with violent rioters, paid protestors, and criminal illegal aliens over law-abiding citizens. Despite an estimated $1 billion in damage, he refused federal relief for weeks, insisting that the riots were peaceful even as small business owners stood in the rubble,\" Loeffler said in the press release.",
      "\"Although the SBA has approved California\u2019s disaster relief request and will begin delivering immediate aid to the innocent victims, Governor Newsom must take accountability for his state-sanctioned crisis \u2013 and stop playing politics with Americans\u2019 livelihoods.\"",

      "The press release noted that the request followed \"weeks of no real solutions and inflammatory social media statements\" until the governor \"finally requested federal disaster relief to bail him out \u2013 again.\"",
      "The relief follows SBA previously approving an additional 11,583\u00a0loans that totaled $2.99 billion in relief earlier this year following the California wildfire disasters in January, Fox News Digital learned, and marked the largest sum of disaster dollars ever approved by SBA for non-hurricane or flooding events.",

      "\"We\u2019re giving Gavin Newsom the opportunity to stop siding with criminal illegal aliens and start siding with law-abiding Americans \u2013 many of whom have lost everything to the violent and destructive riots across Los Angeles,\" Loeffler said in a statement on June 12. \"The migrant mob has looted stores, destroyed storefronts, and committed criminal acts of vandalism against our small businesses. Although local leaders are allowing Los Angeles to burn, federal partners are ready to help American citizens rebuild \u2013 and we will do so, as soon as the Governor answers their call for help.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Gov. Newsom doubled down on Tuesday in a statement to Fox News Digital, blaming last month\u2019s violence in Los Angeles on the Trump administration, while also celebrating the SBA\u2019s approval of relief for affected California businesses.",
      "\"Finally, the federal government is doing the right thing to pay for the damages several small businesses have suffered from the Trump-imposed chaos campaign in Los Angeles. California businesses shouldn\u2019t have to shoulder the burden of Trump\u2019s authoritarian tirade,\" a Newsom spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Tuesday.",

State and local leaders, such as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom, quickly denounced the raids in public statements while offering words of support for illegal immigrants in the state.",

      "\"The violent targeting of law enforcement in Los Angeles by lawless rioters is despicable and Mayor Bass and Governor Newsom must call for it to end,\" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a statement in June as the violence continued. \"The men and women of ICE put their lives on the line to protect and defend the lives of American citizens \u2026 From comparisons to the modern-day Nazi gestapo to glorifying rioters, the violent rhetoric of these sanctuary politicians is beyond the pale.

      "\"Donald Trump has created the conditions you see on your TV tonight. He\u2019s exacerbated the conditions. He\u2019s, you know, lit the proverbial match. He\u2019s putting fuel on this fire ever since he announced he was taking over the National Guard, an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act, and we\u2019re going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,\" Newsom said on June 9 when asked if he would describe the events as \"riots\" or \"peaceful protests.\"",
      "President Donald Trump and Newsom repeatedly traded barbs on social media and during public remarks throughout the protests and riots, with the president arguing Los Angeles would have been destroyed if he had not stepped in.",
      "\"Incompetent Gavin Newscum should have been THANKING me for the job we did in Los Angeles, rather than making sad excuses for the poor job he has done. If it weren\u2019t for me getting the National Guard into Los Angeles, it would be burning to the ground right now!\" Trump posted to Truth Social on June 12.",

      "Newsom touted on Monday that his state has \"invested billions of dollars to fight fires\" and called on Trump \"to put his money where his mouth is\" and help protect communities from wildfires.",
      "\"California has done more than our fair share of \u2018raking\u2019 the forests, now the federal government has to do its part to Make America Rake Again. We\u2019ve invested billions of dollars and treated millions of acres \u2013 more than doubling our state investment from when I took office. We\u2019re doing all we can to protect communities from catastrophic wildfire, will President Trump?\" Newsom said, according to his office's press release."

    "summary": "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.",
    "story": [
      "A few hundred robots moved a building that covers about 43,400 square feet.",
      "Building an open-source humanoid robot has traditionally been out of reach for most people due to high costs and complex proprietary systems. While robotics has made major strides in automation, healthcare, and research, accessible robot design still poses a challenge-especially for students, hobbyists, and small research teams. Most humanoid robots are expensive, hard to modify, and difficult to repair.",
      "That's why a new project from UC Berkeley is getting a lot of attention. The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open-source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components. It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all.",

      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.\u00a0 (Berkeley)",
      "Why accessible robot design is essential for innovation",
      "Building a robot from scratch usually means needing fancy equipment like CNC machines or custom electronics. Most people don't have access to those tools, which makes learning and experimentation hard. That's exactly what the Berkeley team wanted to change.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. The entire robot can be made with parts ordered online and printed at home. It costs less than $5,000 to build, which is far cheaper than most commercial humanoid robots.",
      "Inside Berkeley\u2019s open-source humanoid robot",
      "The robot stands about 39 inches tall and weighs just over 35 pounds. It's powered by modular actuators that use 3D-printed cycloidal gearboxes. These gearboxes distribute pressure across larger gear teeth, which helps the joints last longer and perform more like those found in high-end commercial robots.",
      "Because the design is modular, you don't have to build the whole robot all at once. You can start by printing and testing a single actuator, then gradually move on to assembling full limbs and eventually the entire humanoid. That's a big plus for anyone just getting started with robotics or working with limited resources.",
      "It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all. (Berkeley)",
      "Open source robotics with a strong community focus",
      "Everything about the BHL robot is open source. That includes the hardware design, control software, and even a custom teleoperation system that uses SteamVR. It's built to be easy to control, simple to repair, and endlessly customizable.",
      "There's also a growing community around the project. Builders are sharing tips, upgrades, and full robot builds on Discord and GitHub. That kind of collaboration is a big part of what makes accessible robot design so powerful-it brings more people into the conversation and helps everyone learn faster.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. (Berkeley)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light proves that accessible robot design doesn't have to mean cutting corners. With smart engineering, affordable parts, and a commitment to openness, the team behind BHL is making it easier than ever for anyone to dive into humanoid robotics. Whether you're a student, a maker, or just curious about how robots work, this is one project that shows what's possible when technology is made for everyone.",

      "What sets Meta AI apart from other chatbots is the \"Discover\" tab, a public feed that displays shared conversations. It was meant to encourage community and creativity, letting users showcase interesting prompts and responses. Unfortunately, many didn\u2019t realize their conversations could be made public with just one tap, and the interface often fails to make the public/private distinction clear.",
      "The feature positions Meta AI as a kind of AI-powered social network, blending search, conversation, and status updates. But what sounds innovative on paper has opened the door to major privacy slip-ups.",
      "Why Meta AI\u2019s Discover tab is a privacy risk",
      "Privacy experts are sounding the alarm over Meta's Discover tab, calling it a serious breach of user trust. The feed surfaces chats containing legal dilemmas, therapy discussions, and deeply personal confessions, often linked to real accounts. In some cases, names and profile photos are visible. Although Meta says only shared chats appear, the interface makes it easy to hit \"share\" without realizing it means public exposure. Many assume the button saves the conversation privately. Worse, logging in with a public Instagram account can make shared AI activity publicly accessible by default, increasing the risk of identification.",
      "Some posts reveal sensitive health or legal issues, financial troubles, or relationship conflicts. Others include contact details or even audio clips. A few contain pleas like \"keep this private,\" written by users who didn't realize their messages would be broadcast.

      "Even casual users should take a moment to review their settings and chat history to make sure personal details aren\u2019t being shared without their knowledge.",
      "Are AI chat platforms really private?",
      "This issue isn\u2019t unique to Meta. Most AI chat tools, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini, store your conversations by default and may use them to improve performance, train future models, or develop new features. What many users don\u2019t realize is that their inputs can be reviewed by human moderators, flagged for analysis, or saved in training logs.",
      "Even if a platform says your chats are \"private,\" that usually just means they aren\u2019t visible to the public. It doesn\u2019t mean your data is encrypted, anonymous, or protected from internal access. In many cases, companies retain the right to use your conversations for product development unless you specifically opt out, and finding that opt-out isn't always straightforward.",
      "If you\u2019re signed in with a personal account that includes your real name, email address, or social media links, your activity may be easier to connect to your identity than you think. Combine that with questions about health, finances, or relationships, and you\u2019ve essentially created a detailed digital profile without meaning to.",
      "Some platforms now offer temporary chat modes or incognito settings, but these features are usually off by default. Unless you manually enable them, your data is likely being stored and possibly reviewed.",
      "The takeaway: AI chat platforms are not private by default. You need to actively manage your settings, be mindful of what you share, and stay informed about how your data is being handled behind the scenes.",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect your privacy when using AI chatbots",
      "AI tools can be incredibly helpful, but without the right precautions, they can also open you up to privacy risks. Whether you're using Meta AI, ChatGPT, or any other chatbot, here are some smart, proactive ways to protect yourself:",
      "1) Use aliases and avoid personal identifiers: Don\u2019t use your full name, birthday, address, or any details that could identify you. Even first names combined with other context can be risky.",
      "2) Never share sensitive information: Avoid discussing medical diagnoses, legal matters, bank account info, or anything you wouldn\u2019t want on the front page of a search engine.",
      "3) Clear your chat history regularly: If you\u2019ve already shared sensitive info, go back and delete it. Many AI apps let you clear chat history through Settings or your account dashboard.",
      "4) Adjust privacy settings often: App updates can sometimes reset your preferences or introduce new default options. Even small changes to the interface can affect what\u2019s shared and how. It\u2019s a good idea to check your settings every few weeks to make sure your data is still protected.",
      "5) Use an identity theft protection service: Scammers actively look for exposed data, especially after a privacy slip. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft\u00a0for tips and recommendations.",
      "6) Use a VPN for extra privacy: A reliable VPN hides your IP address and location, making it harder for apps, websites, or bad actors to track your online activity. It also adds protection on public Wi-Fi, shielding your device from hackers who might try to snoop on your connection. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/VPN.",
      "7) Don\u2019t link AI apps to your real social accounts: If possible, create a separate email address or dummy account for experimenting with AI tools. Keep your main profiles disconnected.\u00a0 To create a quick email alias you can use to keep your main accounts protected visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Meta\u2019s decision to turn chatbot prompts into social content has blurred the line between private and public in a way that catches many users off guard. Even if you think your chats are safe, a missed setting or default option can expose more than you intended. Before typing anything sensitive into Meta AI or any chatbot, pause. Check your privacy settings, review your chat history, and think carefully about what you're sharing. A few quick steps now can save you from bigger privacy headaches later.",

      "SparkKitty goes even further than SparkCat. According to Kaspersky, SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. This tactic exposes not just wallet data but also any personal or sensitive photos stored on the device.

      "Kaspersky researchers report that SparkKitty has operated since at least February 2024. Attackers distributed it through both official and unofficial channels, including Google Play and the Apple App Store.",
      "SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kaspersky found SparkKitty embedded in several apps, including one called \u5e01coin on iOS and another called SOEX on Android. Both apps are no longer available in their respective stores. SOEX, a messaging app with cryptocurrency-related features, reached more than 10,000 downloads from the Google Play Store before its removal.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles, often disguised as legitimate components. Once installed, SparkKitty uses a method native to Apple\u2019s Objective-C programming language to run as soon as the app launches. It checks the app\u2019s internal configuration files to decide whether to execute, then quietly starts monitoring the user\u2019s photo library.",
      "On Android, SparkKitty hides in apps written in Java or Kotlin and sometimes uses malicious Xposed or LSPosed modules. It activates when the app launches or after a specific screen opens. The malware then decrypts a configuration file from a remote server and begins uploading images, device metadata, and identifiers.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles. (Apple)",
      "Unlike traditional spyware, SparkKitty focuses on photos, especially those containing cryptocurrency recovery phrases, wallet screenshots, IDs, or sensitive documents. Instead of just monitoring activity, SparkKitty uploads images in bulk. This approach makes it easy for criminals to sift through and extract valuable personal data.",
      "1) Stick to trusted developers:\u00a0Avoid downloading obscure apps, especially if they have few reviews or downloads. Always check the developer's name and history before installing anything.",
      "2) Review app permissions:\u00a0Be cautious of apps that request access to your photos, messages, or files without a clear reason. If something feels off, deny the permission or uninstall the app.",

      "Thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. \"Cyberguy\" Kurt Knutsson explains.",
      "When someone loses the ability to speak because of a neurological condition like ALS, the impact goes far beyond words. It touches every part of daily life, from sharing a joke with family to simply asking for help. Now, thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. This technology isn't just about converting thoughts into text. Instead, it translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly.",

      "There's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. (UC Davis)",
      "Real-time speech through brain signals",
      "The heart of this system is four microelectrode arrays, surgically implanted in the part of the brain responsible for producing speech. These tiny devices pick up the neural activity that happens when someone tries to speak. The signals are then fed into an AI-powered decoding model, which converts them into audible speech in just ten milliseconds. That's so fast, it feels as natural as a regular conversation.",
      "What's especially remarkable is that the system can recreate the user's own voice, thanks to a voice cloning algorithm trained on recordings made before the onset of ALS. This means the person's digital voice sounds like them, not a generic computer voice. The system even recognizes when the user is trying to sing and can change the pitch to match simple melodies. It can also pick up on vocal nuances, like asking a question, emphasizing a word, or making interjections such as \"aah,\" \"ooh,\" or \"hmm.\" All of this adds up to a much more expressive and human-sounding conversation than previous technologies could offer.",
      "It translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly. (UC Davis)",
      "How the technology works",
      "The process starts with the participant attempting to speak sentences shown on a screen. As they try to form each word, the electrodes capture the firing patterns of hundreds of neurons. The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time. This approach allows for subtle control over speech rhythm and tone, giving the user the ability to interrupt, emphasize, or ask questions just as anyone else would.",
      "One of the most striking outcomes from the UC Davis study was that listeners could understand nearly 60 percent of the synthesized words, compared to just four percent without the BCI. The system also handled new, made-up words that weren't part of its training data, showing its flexibility and adaptability.",
      "The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time.\u00a0 (UC Davis)",
      "The impact on daily life",
      "Being able to communicate in real-time, with one's own voice and personality, is a game-changer for people living with paralysis. The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. They can interrupt, respond quickly, and express themselves with nuance. This is a big shift from earlier systems that only translated brain signals into text, which often led to slow, stilted exchanges that felt more like texting than talking.",
      "As David Brandman, the neurosurgeon involved in the study, put it, our voice is a core part of our identity. Losing it is devastating, but this kind of technology offers real hope for restoring that essential part of who we are.",
      "The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. (UC Davis)",
      "Looking ahead: Next steps and challenges",
      "While these early results are promising, the researchers are quick to point out that the technology is still in its early stages. So far, it's only been tested with one participant, so more studies are needed to see how well it works for others, including people with different causes of speech loss, like stroke. The BrainGate2 clinical trial at UC Davis Health is continuing to enroll participants to further refine and test the system.",
      "The technology is still in its early stages. (UC Davis)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Restoring natural, expressive speech to people who have lost their voices is one of the most meaningful advances in brain-computer interface technology. This new system from UC Davis shows that it's possible to bring real-time, personal conversation back into the lives of those affected by paralysis. While there's still work to be done, the progress so far is giving people a chance to reconnect with their loved ones and the world around them in a way that truly feels like their own.",

      "Privacy risks are hiding in plain sight, as your personal data is likely being collected, tracked, and sold without your knowledge. It's not just your name and email out there-data brokers are gathering much more sensitive information about your daily life, including your sleep patterns, medical visits, online habits, and even your relationship status. These details are compiled into detailed personal profiles and sold to advertisers, insurance companies, political campaigns, and in some cases, cybercriminals.

You walk up to a robot-run convenience store, place your order on an app, and robotic arms quickly grab your items and deliver them to a secure window, all without any human employees. That's exactly what's happening at VenHub, a fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store that just opened at the LAX/Metro Transit Center in Los Angeles. Even if you haven't seen one in person yet, VenHub's cutting-edge tech is set to shake up how people shop all across the country.",

      "A fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store. (VenHub)",
      "What Is VenHub? The next evolution of the smart store",
      "Open 24/7 and installable in under a week,\u00a0VenHub is designed for high-traffic environments, such as transit centers, airports, and city hubs, where speed, security, and efficiency are in high demand. Instead of relying on cashiers or attendants, VenHub uses two industrial robotic arms, named Barb and Peter, to handle all product selection and delivery. The process is simple yet futuristic.",
      "Customers place their orders through the VenHub app, pay digitally, and receive a QR code. Upon arrival at the store, the customer scans the code at a secure pickup window. One of the robotic arms then retrieves the items from storage and delivers them to the window within about 90 seconds. The entire transaction is seamless, contactless, and designed to eliminate the frustrations of traditional vending machines or checkout lines.",
      "A fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store. (VenHub)",
      "AI HUMANOID ROBOT IS CHANGING THE WAY YOU BUY CARS AT DEALERSHIPS",
      "The technology powering VenHub",
      "VenHub's foundation is a sophisticated blend of robotics, artificial intelligence, and real-time analytics. The robotic arms are similar to those used in automotive manufacturing, engineered for speed, precision, and reliability. Rather than attempting to mimic human appearance, these arms are optimized for repetitive, high-accuracy tasks that are perfect for retail fulfillment.",
      "Artificial intelligence drives every aspect of store operations. AI algorithms manage inventory by tracking purchasing patterns, adjusting stock levels, and predicting demand based on time of day, location, and customer behavior. Machine vision allows the robots to accurately identify products and handle them with minimal errors or downtime. The entire system is connected through IoT sensors, providing real-time data on inventory, system health, and order status. This data-driven approach enables VenHub to operate efficiently, minimize waste, and ensure popular items are always available.",
      "From the customer's perspective, everything is managed through a mobile app. This app handles payment, order tracking, and pickup notifications, creating a frictionless and transparent shopping experience. On the backend, analytics continually refine operations, making each store smarter over time.",

      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "Why VenHub's model could change retail nationwide",
      "VenHub's model offers significant advantages that could reshape retail across the country. The rapid setup time enables these stores to quickly appear in busy locations, ranging from transportation hubs to college campuses and urban centers. Since the store operates around the clock without breaks, it maximizes both convenience for shoppers and revenue for operators. Eliminating on-site staff dramatically reduces overhead, allowing for competitive pricing and improved profitability.",
      "Security is a major focus for VenHub. The store uses bulletproof glass to protect inventory and customers. If one robot requires maintenance, the other can take over, ensuring reliable service with minimal downtime. VenHub's design is also environmentally conscious, featuring compact, energy-efficient layouts and optional solar power compatibility to reduce its carbon footprint. Each store can be customized to fit local demand, whether that means stocking snacks, electronics, or other essentials.",

      "The human factor: Are robots replacing jobs or creating new ones?",
      "A common concern with automation is the impact on jobs. VenHub's robots do replace some traditional retail roles, but the company emphasizes that new opportunities are emerging. Skilled workers are needed to maintain, restock, and support the automated systems, shifting the workforce toward higher-paying, tech-focused positions. This trend reflects a broader shift in the economy, where automation often transforms jobs rather than eliminating them.",
      "A fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store. (VenHub)",
      "VenHub smart store pricing and ownership: What you need to know",
      "If you're considering bringing a VenHub Smart Store to your city, here's a quick breakdown of the costs and what's included. The price for a VenHub Smart Store ranges from $250,000 to $275,000, depending on your chosen configuration. To secure your spot in the production queue, you'll need a $2,500 pre-order deposit, which is fully refundable up until production begins. Financing is available through select financial institutions, with some buyers qualifying for up to 100% financing. However, all arrangements are handled directly between you and the lender; VenHub does not influence approval decisions.",
      "Once you own a VenHub Smart Store, it's yours outright; there are no leases or franchise agreements. You have complete control over pricing, inventory, and restocking, and you can manage replenishment yourself or use VenHub's preferred fulfillment partners. A monthly software-as-a-service fee of $2,500 covers software updates, AI analytics, remote monitoring, and cloud-based management tools. If you require additional support, an optional maintenance package is available for $1,300 per month, which includes servicing and preventive care.",
      "VenHub does not secure locations for you, but they do offer guidance on choosing high-traffic spots, such as shopping centers, universities, business districts, or commuter hubs, to help maximize your store's performance. With high demand and expanding production capacity, VenHub is working to deliver stores to new owners as quickly as possible across the country.",

      "VenHub truly feels like a glimpse into the future of shopping. Watching robots like Barb and Peter grab your order in just seconds is pretty impressive, but what's even more remarkable is that this technology is already making shopping quicker, safer, and a whole lot easier. As these smart stores start popping up in more places across the country, they might totally change not just how we shop. It's interesting to consider that this kind of smart, connected retail experience could soon become something we all use every day, without even thinking twice about it.",

      "Shanghai is no stranger to jaw-dropping feats of engineering.",
      "In the latest example, a Shanghai historic building moved by robots is capturing global attention. The relocation of the complex in Huayang, a Shikumen-style building weighing about 7,500 metric tons (approximately 8,267 U.S. tons) and covering roughly 43,400 square feet, is truly rewriting the rules.",
      "This ambitious project is powered by an army of 432 small robots that are moving the massive structure about 33 feet each day to make way for a new underground development. Let's dive into how this is happening, why it matters and what it means for the future of urban preservation.",

      "What makes the Shanghai historic building moved by robots so special?",
      "The Huayanli complex is a set of three brick-and-wood buildings constructed between the 1920s and 1930s. Located in the heart of Shanghai's historic Zhangyuan area, these structures are classic examples of shikumen architecture, which is a unique blend of Western and Chinese design. Zhangyuan itself is over 140 years old and is one of Shanghai's largest and best-preserved shikumen neighborhoods.",

      "The relocation is not just for show. The city is building a three-story underground center beneath the complex that will include over 570,000 square feet of cultural and commercial space, a parking garage with more than 100 spots and a transportation hub that will connect three major subway lines.

      "Moving a building of this size is tough enough, but the challenge is multiplied by Zhangyuan's dense web of narrow alleys and closely packed historic buildings. Traditional relocation methods simply would not fit. The area's historic significance also means that any mistake could damage irreplaceable architecture, including the 1928 \"great hall\" that once housed a patriotic night school.",

These robots gently lift the building and slowly move it forward, inch by inch, covering about 33 feet each day. To achieve this incredible level of precision, the project relies on several advanced technologies. Special low-clearance drilling robots, which can be operated remotely, navigate tight corridors and doorways to create new foundations beneath the historic structure.",
      "Earth-moving robots equipped with folding mechanical arms, just under four feet wide, use artificial intelligence to tell the difference between clay and solid obstacles. Engineers also use building information modeling and point cloud scanning to create highly detailed 3D blueprints. These digital models help the team plan exact movement routes, avoid potential collisions and design curved paths for removing soil.",
      "To keep the construction site efficient and minimize disruption, soil is carried out using a conveyor belt system, much like an assembly line. The move is only temporary. Once the underground construction is finished, the Huayanli complex will be carefully returned to its original spot, fully restored and preserved, now sitting atop a modern underground facility.",

When third-party vendors handle patient data, the security of that data becomes dependent on their infrastructure.",

      "5 ways you can protect yourself from healthcare data breach",
      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.",
      "These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "What makes this breach especially alarming is that many of the affected patients may have never even heard of Episource. As a business-to-business vendor, Episource operates in the background, working with insurers and healthcare providers, not with patients directly. The people affected were customers of those companies, yet it's their most sensitive data now at risk because of a third party they never chose or trusted.

      "There\u2019s a new PayPal phishing scam making the rounds, and it\u2019s so convincing that even security-conscious users are getting caught in it. Unlike typical scams riddled with typos and fake domains, this one uses PayPal\u2019s own email system to send you an alert that looks 100% real.",

      "PayPal app on a smartphone\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the latest PayPal phishing scam is so convincing",
      "Most phishing scams try (and fail) to impersonate big companies. You\u2019ve probably seen the classics: weird grammar, suspicious email addresses, Microsoft spelled with a \"k\". They\u2019re laughably bad. But this scam flips the script because it uses PayPal against you. Here's how the scam operates:",
      "Exploiting real features:\u00a0Scammers abuse PayPal\u2019s \"add address\" or \"money request\" tools. By entering your email, they can trigger real emails from PayPal\u2019s real domain. And this works even if you don\u2019t have a PayPal account.",
      "Bypassing filters: Because these emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s servers (service@paypal.com), they pass all security checks and appear legitimate in your inbox.",
      "Lack of suspicion: Some versions contain no phishing links at all, just a scammer\u2019s phone number, making them even harder to detect.",
      "Panic bait: The message often claims a new address was added, or a large payment is being processed, getting your attention and provoking a quick reaction.",
      "Follow-up attacks: After the initial email, scammers may later contact you pretending to be PayPal support. Some urge you to click a link to \"secure your account\", which leads to a fake login page designed to steal your credentials.",
      "THE DARK SIDE OF PAYPAL AND HOW TO STAY SAFE",
      "Real examples of the PayPal phishing scam in action",
      "This scam has been reported by dozens of users on Reddit and cybersecurity forums. One Reddit user posted a detailed thread in r/Scams showing screenshots of phishing emails that look like they came straight from PayPal\u2019s official address.",
      "Phishing email sent from\u00a0service@paypal.com (Reddit)",
      "In a newer and more sophisticated twist, scammers are removing links altogether. Instead, they include a phone number and ask you to call. Once you do, you\u2019re connected with a fake PayPal representative who says they need to verify your identity. They then instruct you to download what appears to be a PayPal-branded support tool, but really it\u2019s a customized remote access app hosted on a different server. And once it\u2019s installed, it gives the scammer full access to your device.",

      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "How scammers are hijacking PayPal\u2019s system to send fake alerts",
      "This part is still a bit of a mystery. With typical PayPal invoice scams, content is tightly controlled, which means you normally can\u2019t change the email structure or messaging. However, these new emails suggest that scammers may be exploiting internal features, like business tools or API fields, to sneak custom content into PayPal-generated alerts. It\u2019s not just phishing, it\u2019s weaponizing a legitimate system to create trust and evade detection.",
      "Why this PayPal phishing attack is so dangerous",
      "This scam is especially effective and dangerous because the emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s official servers, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate messages. Since the sender address and branding are authentic, recipients are more likely to trust the communication without suspicion.",
      "The scammers also use urgent language that creates a sense of panic, such as warnings about unauthorized activity or large charges. This pressure encourages people to act quickly and often before fully considering whether the alert is genuine.",
      "Additionally, the scam often involves follow-up contact through calls or texts from individuals posing as PayPal personnel, further exploiting the initial confusion and increasing the chances of victims giving up sensitive information.",

      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Adding 2FA to your PayPal and email accounts gives you a second layer of defense even if your password gets compromised.",
      "3. Use a password manager:\u00a0Using a password manager is the best way to ensure every login you use has a unique, strong password. No repeats means no chain reaction if one site gets hacked. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Check your account manually: If you\u2019re ever in doubt, just log into your PayPal account directly. Review\u00a0recent activity and see if anything looks off. There is no need to rely on alerts alone.",
      "5. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward suspicious PayPal messages to phishing@paypal.com. You can also\u00a0report phishing attempts to the FTC.",
      "6. Use a personal data removal service: Since phishing scams like the recent PayPal scam often target personal information that scammers gather from data brokers and people search sites, using a reputable data removal service can help reduce your exposure. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Scammers exploit PayPal\u2019s built-in features to send real notifications that look legitimate. What makes it especially sneaky is the absence of links, Instead, these emails include a phone number, making them more likely to pass through spam filters. When you call, you\u2019re connected to a fake PayPal rep who pressures you into downloading a remote access tool disguised as support software. The safest move? Don\u2019t click, don\u2019t call.

There's a lot of hope that new designs, like small modular reactors, could make things faster and cheaper, but those technologies haven't been proven at scale just yet.",
      "Gov. Hochul pointed out that a lot of the hurdles are at the federal level. Getting the necessary permits and approvals can take years, and the process is anything but simple. There's also the challenge of finding a skilled workforce, securing a steady supply of nuclear fuel, and figuring out what to do with spent fuel once the plant is up and running.",

      "It started with a Facebook friend request and a message that felt too good to be true.",

      "The woman this happened to in Jensen Beach, Florida, wrote us saying, \"He kept telling me it was my lucky day. I had just won a new white Tesla and $250,000 in cash. All I needed to do was send him an Apple Gift Card for $200. So I did. Well, $800 later, he wanted more to pay for the broken-down truck that was on its way to my house to deliver my winnings.\"",

      "A person trying a Tesla vehicle. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Elon Musk Tesla Facebook scam works",
      "This type of scam often begins after someone posts about Musk, Tesla or cryptocurrency. Scammers monitor public Facebook activity, then send a friend request from an account using Musk\u2019s name and photo. The profile may look legitimate, with copied images, reposted news articles or AI-generated content.",
      "Once the request is accepted, the impersonator encourages the victim to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. From there, the scam unfolds in a way that feels casual but calculated. The victim is congratulated on being randomly selected to win a brand-new Tesla and a large cash prize, often around $250,000. But before the reward can be delivered, they are told to cover \"delivery fees\" using an Apple Gift Card.",
      "In the case of the woman from Jensen Beach, she sent multiple gift cards totaling $800 before realizing the story was a setup. After claiming that a delivery truck had broken down, the scammer requested even more money. That's when she recognized the pattern and blocked the account.

      "Launder the funds through reselling sites or gaming platforms.",
      "Apple Gift Cards are frequently used because they are easy to find in stores and can be used for high-value digital purchases. But scammers also use Google Play, Amazon, Steam and Visa prepaid cards, depending on what they think the victim can access. These requests usually come with urgency. Victims may be told to stay on the phone while buying the cards or to scratch off the back and send a photo of the code right away. That sense of pressure is designed to override second thoughts. If anyone you do not know asks for payment in gift cards, it is a scam. No legitimate organization or contest will ever ask for them as payment or verification.",

      "Scams that impersonate celebrities or public figures have become increasingly common. Criminals use well-known names to create a false sense of trust and urgency. Once they have your attention, they use that trust to steal money or personal information. Musk is one of the most frequently impersonated figures in scam campaigns. His name is widely associated with innovation, crypto and high-value giveaways, which makes him a perfect target for fraudsters trying to appear legitimate. Some of the most common Elon-related scams include:",

She lost over $26,000 before realizing it was a hoax.Crypto giveaway livestreams: These scams often appear on YouTube or in ads, claiming that Musk is hosting a giveaway.

      "What ties these scams together is the use of a familiar face to lower suspicion. The scammer may use deepfake video, AI-generated voice clips or doctored screenshots to make the offer feel more real. Once the target engages, the pressure begins. Victims are asked to send money, act quickly and avoid telling anyone.

      "1. Never send gift card codes to anyone you do not know: If someone asks for Apple, Amazon or Google Play cards as payment or verification, it is a scam. No real prize, agency or company will request gift cards.",
      "2. Be skeptical of prize claims from celebrity accounts: Musk is not messaging people on Facebook to give away Teslas or cash. If the profile is unverified or the offer feels random, trust your instincts and ignore it.",
      "3. Do not move conversations to private apps like WhatsApp or Telegram: Scammers often push for this because these platforms have fewer safeguards, no public comment threads and limited reporting tools. Once the chat moves off Facebook, it becomes much harder to verify or report what\u2019s happening. If someone you do not know insists on switching platforms, it\u2019s usually a sign they are hiding something.",
      "4. Consider using a data removal service: If a scammer has targeted you or impersonated you online, chances are your personal information is floating around on data broker websites. These sites collect and sell everything from your home address to your family members\u2019 names, making you a bigger target for future scams. Data removal services can help you scan the web and request the deletion of your info from these brokers. While you can do this manually, it\u2019s time-consuming. Services like\u00a0Incogni offer subscriptions that automate the process and monitor for new exposures. If you\u2019ve been scammed or suspect your information was leaked, using a data removal service adds another layer of protection and peace of mind.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "5. Watch for common red flags: Be cautious of sudden friend requests from unfamiliar accounts, vague messages that mention surprise winnings, poor grammar or any pressure to act quickly. Scammers often use emotional triggers to override your judgment. If something feels off or too convenient, it probably is.",
      "6. Install strong antivirus software on all devices: Some impersonation scams include links to phishing pages or malware. Antivirus tools can block these threats before they reach your inbox. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Use two-factor authentication and a password manager: If a scam compromises your login credentials,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) can block unauthorized access. A password manager also helps protect against reused or weak passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "8. Report the scam right away: Use\u00a0Facebook\u2019s reporting tools to flag fake profiles or messages. You can also file a complaint with the FTC at\u00a0ReportFraud.ftc.gov to help warn others.",

      "A federal appeals court ruled that Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of a Black man who was sentenced to death in 1990, noting that Black people were rejected from the jury during his trial.",
      "Michael Sockwell, 62, is now eligible for a retrial after ruling on Monday by a three-judge panel on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. He was convicted of killing former Montgomery County Sheriff Isaiah Harris in 1988 when he was 26-years-old.",
      "In a 2-1 opinion, the panel ruled that Alabama prosecutors violated Sockwell's 14th Amendment rights by \"repeatedly and purposefully\" rejecting potential Black jurors who were believed to be more sympathetic since they shared the same race.",
      "Prosecutors argued that Harris' wife hired Sockwell to kill Harris because she wanted to cover up an affair she was having and collect her husband's insurance money.",

      "There were no witnesses to the shooting and Sockwell initially told officials in a videotaped confession that he killed Harris. During his trial, Sockwell testified that officers threatened to beat and kill him before his confession and that they deprived him of food and water.",
      "Sockwell then testified that the man who was having an affair with Harris' wife killed the former sheriff. Sockwell also denied ever receiving money to kill Harris.",

      "Attorneys for Sockwell say he has a low IQ that disqualifies him from the death penalty. (AP)",
      "The jury voted 7-5 to sentence Sockwell to life in prison, but the judge overruled the decision and sentenced him to death. Alabama no longer allows a judge to override a jury\u2019s sentence in capital cases.",
      "Sockwell's attorneys appealed the decision, arguing that the prosecutors unconstitutionally used race as the basis for jury selection and rejected 80% of the potential Black jurors who were eligible for his trial, compared to only 20% of White jurors who were rejected. The appeal pointed to notes from the prosecutor that rejected one juror who she described as \"a Black male, approximately twenty-three years of age, which would put him very close to the same race, sex, and age of\" Sockwell.",
      "Judge Robert J. Luck, an appointee of President Donald Trump, dissented, arguing that the prosecutor noted the race of potential White jurors too, which the judge said indicated race was not a disqualifying factor for jurors in Sockwell\u2019s case.",

      "The opinion written by Judge Charles Wilson, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, also cited four other cases in the years leading up to Sockwell's case, in which the state prosecutor appeared to have illegally rejected Black jurors based solely on their race, demonstrating a \"pattern\" of choosing juries with \"discriminatory intent.\"",
      "Luck pushed back on the claim that the prosecutor had a pattern of discrimination, saying 17% of the jury in Sockwell's trial was Black out of a jury pool that was 24% Black to begin with.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Republicans on Tuesday passed changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar spending bill.",
      "Passed via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, of 2017, there\u2019s a $10,000 limit on the SALT deduction through 2025, which has been a pain point for certain lawmakers in high-tax blue states.",
      "If enacted, the Senate bill would lift the cap to $40,000 starting in 2025, with the phaseout starting over $500,000 of income. Both figures would increase by 1% yearly through 2029 and the $40,000 limit would revert to $10,000 in 2030.",
      "By contrast, the House-approved measure under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would offer the higher limit for a longer window. The $40,000 cap would begin in 2025, with the same $500,000 income phaseout, and both figures would rise by 1% annually from 2026 through 2033.",
      "The Senate\u2019s legislation still needs House approval before the final bill can be delivered to Trump\u2019s desk. It was unclear Tuesday whether moderate House Republicans would accept the Senate\u2019s proposed SALT deduction changes.",
      "Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the SALT deduction was unlimited for taxpayers who itemized deductions. But the so-called alternative minimum tax reduced the benefit for some higher earners.",
      "While the higher SALT cap lasts longer under the House bill, SALT relief is two-thirds larger in the Senate bill when including alternative minimum tax changes, according to a Saturday analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "Both bills also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap. This reduction is bigger in the House bill.",
      "How the SALT deduction works",
      "When filing taxes, you pick the greater of the standard deduction or your itemized deductions, including SALT capped at $10,000, medical expenses above 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, charitable gifts and others.",
      "Starting in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the standard deduction, and it adjusts for inflation yearly. For 2025, the standard deduction is $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for married couples filing jointly. These could increase under the Senate-proposed tax bill.",
      "Under the current thresholds, the vast majority of filers \u2014 roughly 90%, according to the latest IRS data \u2014 use the standard deduction and don\u2019t benefit from itemized tax breaks.",
      "Who would benefit from the higher SALT cap",
      "Raising the SALT deduction cap would primarily benefit higher earners, according to a May analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "The Senate legislation would also protect a SALT cap workaround for pass-through businesses, which allows owners to sidestep the $10,000 cap. By contrast, the House-approved bill would have ended the strategy for certain white-collar professionals.",
      "\u201cThis SALT \u2018deal\u2019 in the latest Senate bill is a nonsensical approach to tax policy,\u201d Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of the Tax Law Center at New York University School of Law, wrote in a post on X on Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt preserves (and lessens) a limit on deductions for wealthy taxpayers while ignoring a loophole that allows the wealthiest of those taxpayers to avoid the limit entirely,\u201d she wrote.",

      "The Senate\u2019s timeline to nix the EV tax credits is more stringent than an initial version of the legislation passed in May by House Republicans, who would have ended the tax breaks after Dec. 31. The House's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" also exempted certain EVs from that deadline.",
      "Tax incentives make EVs more affordable",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark climate law signed by then-President Joe Biden, offered the tax breaks for EVs through 2032.",
      "The federal tax incentives aimed to boost uptake of EVs \u2014 and reduce the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 by making them more affordable relative to traditional cars with an internal combustion engine.",
      "The transportation sector accounts for about 28% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest contributor of U.S. emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Fully electric cars don\u2019t emit planet-warming greenhouse gases from their tailpipes because they don\u2019t burn fossil fuels.",
      "While some emissions may be created when electric cars are built and charged, EVs are \u201cunambiguously better for the climate\u201d than gasoline-powered cars even when factoring in those life-cycle emissions, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The EV premium is shrinking",
      "New EVs have historically come with higher price tags than comparable traditional cars, experts said.",
      "In May, the average new EV had a price tag around $57,700 before subsidies, while gas cars cost around $48,100, according to Kelley Blue Book data. Used EVs had a price point around $36,000, slightly higher than the $34,000 for used internal-combustion-engine cars, it found.",
      "The price gap is shrinking, experts said.",
      "Federal tax incentives like the $7,500 federal tax credit \u201cplay a pivotal role in accelerating the break-even point between electric vehicles and gasoline vehicles,\u201d wrote researchers at the University of Michigan in 2024.",
      "Despite a higher price tag, EVs may be a better financial deal for consumers over the long haul because maintenance, repair and fuel costs tend to be lower than those for gas cars, experts said.",
      "Even if the federal tax credit disappears, state and local tax incentives may still be available for EV buyers, experts said.",
      "If Republicans nix the federal tax credit, consumers would need to ensure they have the car in hand by Sept. 30 in order to claim the subsidy, Malmgren said.",
      "She recommends opting for the tax break upfront at the point of sale instead of claiming it next year on one\u2019s annual tax return.",

      "The Dalai Lama said on Wednesday that the ancient Tibetan Buddhist institution he leads will live on after he dies, putting an end to speculation that he would be the last person to hold the role as he plans to reincarnate.",
      "As part of celebrations marking his 90th birthday, the Nobel Peace laureate also signalled that China, which Tibetan activists accuse of suppressing their language, culture and religion, should stay out of the process of choosing the next Dalai Lama.",
      "The 14th Dalai Lama's rare remarks came as anxiety mounts over who will follow him as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "\u201cI am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,\u201d said the Dalai Lama, who has spent almost 70 years living in exile in India after fleeing Tibet, an autonomous Himalayan region of China.",
      "\u201cI hereby reiterate that the Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognize the future reincarnation,\u201d he said, referring to an organization he founded. \u201cNo one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government responded`to the comments swiftly, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson saying that any succession planning must comply with laws and regulations, according to Reuters.",
      "The Tibetan spiritual leader made the announcement days ahead of his 90th birthday on July 6, after a conference of representatives of the four major traditions of Tibetan Buddhism in the Indian city of Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.",
      "It\u2019s unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation. But as the 14th Dalai Lama grows older, there is growing worry that a gap in leadership could be taken advantage of by the Chinese government.",
      "\u201cI think His Holiness feels the need to reassure people by basically letting them know that he is thinking about the succession,\u201d Thupten Jinpa, his English translator of four decades, said in a phone interview from India last week.",
      "Identified as a baby in 1937, the 14th Dalai Lama was formally recognized two years later. In addition to his role as spiritual leader, he served as temporal leader of Tibet starting in 1950, when he was 15 and China began annexing the region.",
      "In 1959, when he was 23, the Dalai Lama and thousands of other Tibetans fled to India after a failed uprising against Communist rule, eventually settling in Dharamsala.",
      "Since the 1970s, the goal of the movement has shifted from Tibetan independence to achieving genuine autonomy within China. In recent years the Dalai Lama has also stepped down from his political role, which is now a democratically elected position.",
      "In March, the Dalai Lama said in a new book that his successor would be born in the \u201cfree world\u201d outside China, so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama could continue. According to the Central Tibetan Administration, there are about 130,000 Tibetan exiles around the world, mostly in India and Nepal.",
      "The Dalai Lama had previously said in 2011 that the institution of the Dalai Lama did not necessarily have to continue at all, and that he would leave it up to the Tibetan Buddhist community.",
      "Since then he has received appeals from a variety of constituencies, and the \u201cunanimous\u201d response, Jinpa said, has been that there should be a 15th Dalai Lama.",
      "\u201cFor the Tibetan people, his name has come to symbolize the nation,\u201d said Jinpa, who has assisted the Dalai Lama with a number of books including the recent \u201cVoice for the Voiceless.\u201d",
      "There is also concern that if they don\u2019t select a new Dalai Lama, China could name one who goes unchallenged.",
      "\u201cSadly, the PRC government probably will want to play a role, just as it inserted itself in the process of the recognition of the Panchen Lama,\u201d Jinpa said, referring to the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "In 1995, the Dalai Lama recognized a 6-year-old boy in Tibet as the 11th Panchen Lama, after the previous one died six years earlier. The boy was forcibly disappeared by the Chinese government three days later, rights groups say, and has not been seen in public since.",
      "China then chose its own Panchen Lama, imposing him on the six million people in Tibet.",
      "The Tibetan government-in-exile does not recognize the Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama, who rarely appears in public but pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party in a closed-door meeting last month with President Xi Jinping, state media reported.",
      "If Beijing also tries to name a Dalai Lama, \u201cTibetans would not be surprised,\u201d Jinpa said. \u201cThey would be disappointed and annoyed, but I don\u2019t think they would be surprised.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government says Tibet has prospered under its rule, and that it has improved infrastructure and social conditions and promoted economic development. It says the Dalai Lama is \u201ca political exile engaged in separatist activities under the guise of religion,\u201d and that the reincarnation of Tibetan lamas should be controlled by Beijing.",
      "Reincarnation \u201cmust comply with Chinese laws and regulations\u201d and \u201cfollow the process that consists of search and identification in China, lot-drawing from a golden urn, and central government approval,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in March."

    "story": [
      "Progressive state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani has won New York City\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary, NBC News projects, marking a stunning rise by the 33-year-old democratic socialist over powerful former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.",
      "The projection comes as the New York City Board of Elections released the initial round of ranked-choice voting results, with Mamdani emerging as the top candidate.",
      "Mamdani won 56% of the vote after the initial ranked-choice tabulation narrowed the race to Mamdani and Cuomo, who won 44%. The initial tabulation includes ballots cast in person and mail ballots received and processed as of last week\u2019s primary Election Day. Voters could rank up to five candidates in order of preference, and the candidates with the lowest number of voters are eliminated first. Their votes are then reallocated to their supporters\u2019 next choice, and the process continues until two candidates remain.",
      "Mamdani's surprise victory over Cuomo, who had long been viewed as the front-runner, received attention far outside New York City, raising more questions for a Democratic Party establishment that is struggling with its path forward after its 2024 losses.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s status as the Democratic nominee will no doubt be a boost in the heavily Democratic city, but he will have to face Mayor Eric Adams, who was elected as a Democrat but decided to run for re-election as an independent after Trump\u2019s Justice Department dropped corruption charges against him. Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa will also be on the fall ballot along with other candidates.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear whether Mamdani has defeated Cuomo for good. Cuomo will still be on the November ballot after forming his own political party, declining to remove his name by last week\u2019s deadline. But it remains to be seen if Cuomo will actively campaign as a third-party candidate.",
      "Cuomo campaign spokesman Rich Azzopardi said Monday that the campaign did not expect the ranked choice results to be \u201call that revelatory,\u201d given the results of primary voters\u2019 first choices released last week.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be examining the expected makeup and opinions of general electorate voters while determining next steps,\u201d Azzopardi said in a statement.",
      "Mamdani, though, is confident that he can beat both Adams and Cuomo in November.",
      "\u201cWe can beat anyone that\u2019s in this race because what we\u2019ve shown is that this is a campaign that has the support of more than 400,000 New Yorkers,\u201d Mamdani told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, adding that the race will be a \u201creferendum\u201d on how Adams \u201cmade this city so unaffordable.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor too long, politicians have pretended to simply be bystanders to a cost of living crisis,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually exacerbated it. And our vision is one that will respond to it and make this a city affordable for every New Yorker.\u201d",
      "Primary victory",
      "Running in the highest-profile race of his life, Mamdani took down Cuomo, a former governor who had been one of the most prominent Democrats in the country before his downfall in 2021, when he resigned amid sexual harassment allegations.",
      "Cuomo had asked Democratic voters for a second chance by framing himself as uniquely suited to run the city given his past executive experience and history pushing back on President Donald Trump. Backed by prominent Democrats and wealthy donors, Cuomo and his allies blanketed the city with ads and vastly outspent his rivals.",
      "But in the end, Mamdani emerged victorious, as Democrats signaled they\u2019re ready to move on to a fresh face promising a new, progressive direction for the city. Now, he could become the city\u2019s first Muslim mayor.",
      "Mamdani won his seat in the New York state Assembly in 2020, representing parts of Queens. Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani grew up primarily in the city as the son of an academic and a filmmaker, leaving the city to attend Bowdoin College in Maine before returning to Queens to work as a foreclosure prevention counselor. He became an American citizen in 2018 and narrowly defeated an incumbent Democratic legislator in his 2020 run for office, in which he was backed by the Democratic Socialists of America.",
      "Mamdani has embraced that democratic socialist moniker at a time where Democratic Party faces an identity crisis across the country. His campaign has been centered on a call to \u201cput working people first\u201d and provide a new direction for the city funded by tax increases on the wealthy.",
      "Mamdani has drawn the ire of Republicans, including Trump, who wrote in a Truth Social post that Democrats \u201ccrossed the line\u201d to support Mamdani, who is \u201ca 100% Communist Lunatic,\u201d",
      "Mamdani told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Trump \u201cwants to distract from what I\u2019m fighting for. And I\u2019m fighting for the very working people that he ran a campaign to empower, that he has since then betrayed.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd when we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] from decades ago who said, \u2018Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God\u2019s children in this country,\u2019\u201d Mamdani said.",
      "Mamdani drew significant blowback from Cuomo and prominent Jewish leaders during the primary for not denouncing the slogan \u201cglobalize the intifada\u201d when asked about it during a podcast interview. Mamdani referred to the slogan as \u201ca desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights,\u201d and added that the U.S. Holocaust Museum had used the Arabic word \u201cintifada\u201d in a translated description of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against Nazi Germany.",
      "The museum, as well as a handful of Jewish leaders, criticized those comments and accused Mamdani of stoking antisemitism, while Cuomo and his allies pointed to the episode to claim Mamdani shouldn\u2019t be elected to lead a city with a sizable Jewish population.",
      "Asked why he would not condemn the slogan, Mamdani told \"Meet the Press\": \u201cMy concern is to start to walk down the line of language and making clear what language I believe is permissible or impermissible takes me into a place similar to that of the president, who is looking to do those very kinds of things \u2014 putting people in jail for writing an op-ed, putting them in jail for protesting.\u201d",
      "\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s not language that I use,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cIt\u2019s language I understand there are concerns about. And what I will do is showcase my vision for this city through my words and my actions.\u201d"

Roley, who dreamed of becoming a firefighter himself, was found dead on the mountain from a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "Who is Wess Roley?",
      "Norris said Roley grew up in an arborist family, telling reporters that the family climbed trees. An arborist is a trained professional in the care and management of trees and woody plants.",
      "\"We did have reports that he was shooting at first responders via a tree,\" he said Monday at a news conference.",
      "Court documents show that Roley may have had a tumultuous childhood. In 2015, his mother, Heather Lynn Cuchiara, sought an order of protection against her then-husband and Roley\u2019s father, Jason Roley.",
      "The documents allege that Jason Roley pushed her to the ground and made threatening remarks about \"waiting outside with a sniper rifle.\" Cuchiara expressed concerns about drugs and two guns in his home and asked that the order of protection include Wess Roley, who was about 10 years old at the time.",

      "Kootenai County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Coeur d\u2019Alene Police Department had five interactions with Roley, according to Norris.

      "\"He actually really respected law enforcement,\" he told NBC News. \"He loved firefighters. It didn\u2019t make sense that he was shooting firefighters. Maybe he got rejected or something.\"",

      "Dale Roley said his grandson could be \"high-strung\" and \"kind of a loner.\" He attributed it to \"normal issues for kids these days,\" but T.J. Franks Jr., Roley\u2019s former roommate, knew something was off.",
      "\"Towards the end, he started acting a little weird, and I don\u2019t know why. But we just explained to him that we needed our own space,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "Roley lived with Franks in Sandpoint, Idaho, for about six months. He moved out in January.",

      "Fire was intentionally set, investigators say",
      "Authorities have said they believe Roley intentionally set the blaze to ambush firefighters. He was found with a flint starter and a shotgun, according to Norris.",
      "\"We believe that was his method for starting the fire that eventually led to firefighters responding,\" he said at the news conference.",
      "A man called to report the fire at about 1:20 p.m. local time. Norris said the caller did not use Roley\u2019s name.",

      "The weapons being delayed include dozens of Patriot interceptors that can defend against incoming Russian missiles, thousands of 155 mm high explosive Howitzer munitions, more than 100 Hellfire missiles, more than 250 precision-guided missile systems known as GMLRS and dozens each of Stinger surface-to-air missiles, AIM air-to-air missiles and grenade launchers, the two defense officials, two congressional officials and two sources with knowledge of the decision said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said: \u201cThis decision was made to put America\u2019s interests first following a DOD review of our nation\u2019s military support and assistance to other countries across the globe. The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned \u2014 just ask Iran.\" The Defense Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "At a closing news conference after a NATO meeting at The Hague last week, President Donald Trump said the United States is trying to find Patriot air defense missiles to send to Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThey do want to have the anti-missile missiles,\u201d Trump said of Ukraine. \u201cAs they call them the Patriots, and we\u2019re going to see if we can make some available.\u201d He said that the United States is supplying weapons to Israel and that \u201cyou know, they\u2019re very hard to get. We need them, too.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the White House's announcement.",
      "Ukraine has repeatedly appealed for additional U.S. and European air defense weaponry as Russia has stepped up its air raids in recent months. Over the weekend, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Russia had launched the largest aerial attack on the country since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, firing 60 missiles and 477 drones.",
      "Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are also working to secure a permanent ceasefire. Though it\u2019s common for new administrations to pause weapons transfers to assess stockpiles, there are concerns about the moment in which this is happening, according to an official with knowledge of the situation. The official said Ukraine needs to appear strong to get Russia to the negotiating table.",
      "During a visit to Washington on June 5, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s top adviser, Andriy Yermak, told reporters that his country was holding off Russian forces but needed more air defense systems to safeguard its cities from Russian attacks.",
      "The munitions were approved as part of Presidential Drawdown Authority and Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative packages during the Biden administration, the defense officials and two sources with knowledge of the decision said. Some of the shipments are already in the region but have been stopped before being turned over to Ukraine, according to a defense official and two sources with knowledge of the decision.",
      "Last month, the acting chief of naval operations, Adm. James Kilby, warned during testimony before Congress that while the Navy has enough standard missiles, known as SM-3s, right now, the United States has been using some missiles and munitions \u201cat an alarming rate.\u201d"

    "summary": "The move follows a law passed by Iran\u2019s parliament last week, after American airstrikes hit Iran's most-important nuclear facilities.",
    "story": [
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Iran\u2019s president on Wednesday reportedly ordered the country to suspend its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency after American airstrikes hit its most-important nuclear facilities.",
      "State media online reported the decision by President Masoud Pezeshkian.",
      "It follows a law passed by Iran\u2019s parliament to suspend that cooperation. It also already received the OK of a constitutional watchdog as well.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what that would mean for the IAEA, the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog.",
      "The Vienna-based IAEA long has monitored Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The agency didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "After the law\u2019s passage, Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council was to oversee the bill and implementation. While the council itself hasn\u2019t said anything publicly, Pezeshkian is the head of the council, so his reported order signals that the bill would be implemented.",
      "However, under Iran\u2019s theocractic government, there is room for the council to implement the bill as they see fit. That means that everything lawmakers asked for might not be done.",
      "Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, negotiated under then U.S. President Barack Obama, allowed Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67% \u2014 enough to fuel a nuclear power plant, but far below the threshold of 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium. It also drastically reduced Iran\u2019s stockpile of uranium, limited its use of centrifuges and relied on the IAEA to oversee Tehran\u2019s compliance through additional oversight.",
      "But U.S. President Donald Trump, in his first term in 2018, unilaterally withdrew Washington from the accord, insisting it wasn\u2019t tough enough and didn\u2019t address Iran\u2019s missile program or its support for militant groups in the wider Middle East. That set in motion years of tensions, including attacks at sea and on land.",
      "Iran had been enriching up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. It also has enough of a stockpile to build multiple nuclear bombs, should it choose to do so. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003."

      "The Dalai Lama said on Wednesday that the ancient Tibetan Buddhist institution he leads will live on after he dies, putting an end to speculation that he would be the last person to hold the role as he plans to reincarnate.",
      "As part of celebrations marking his 90th birthday, the Nobel Peace laureate also signalled that China, which Tibetan activists accuse of suppressing their language, culture and religion, should stay out of the process of choosing the next Dalai Lama.",
      "The 14th Dalai Lama's rare remarks came as anxiety mounts over who will follow him as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "\u201cI am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,\u201d said the Dalai Lama, who has spent almost 70 years living in exile in India after fleeing Tibet, an autonomous Himalayan region of China.",
      "\u201cI hereby reiterate that the Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognize the future reincarnation,\u201d he said, referring to an organization he founded. \u201cNo one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government responded`to the comments swiftly, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson saying that any succession planning must comply with laws and regulations, according to Reuters.",
      "The Tibetan spiritual leader made the announcement days ahead of his 90th birthday on July 6, after a conference of representatives of the four major traditions of Tibetan Buddhism in the Indian city of Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.",
      "It\u2019s unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation. But as the 14th Dalai Lama grows older, there is growing worry that a gap in leadership could be taken advantage of by the Chinese government.",
      "\u201cI think His Holiness feels the need to reassure people by basically letting them know that he is thinking about the succession,\u201d Thupten Jinpa, his English translator of four decades, said in a phone interview from India last week.",
      "Identified as a baby in 1937, the 14th Dalai Lama was formally recognized two years later. In addition to his role as spiritual leader, he served as temporal leader of Tibet starting in 1950, when he was 15 and China began annexing the region.",
      "In 1959, when he was 23, the Dalai Lama and thousands of other Tibetans fled to India after a failed uprising against Communist rule, eventually settling in Dharamsala.",
      "Since the 1970s, the goal of the movement has shifted from Tibetan independence to achieving genuine autonomy within China. In recent years the Dalai Lama has also stepped down from his political role, which is now a democratically elected position.",
      "In March, the Dalai Lama said in a new book that his successor would be born in the \u201cfree world\u201d outside China, so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama could continue. According to the Central Tibetan Administration, there are about 130,000 Tibetan exiles around the world, mostly in India and Nepal.",
      "The Dalai Lama had previously said in 2011 that the institution of the Dalai Lama did not necessarily have to continue at all, and that he would leave it up to the Tibetan Buddhist community.",
      "Since then he has received appeals from a variety of constituencies, and the \u201cunanimous\u201d response, Jinpa said, has been that there should be a 15th Dalai Lama.",
      "\u201cFor the Tibetan people, his name has come to symbolize the nation,\u201d said Jinpa, who has assisted the Dalai Lama with a number of books including the recent \u201cVoice for the Voiceless.\u201d",
      "There is also concern that if they don\u2019t select a new Dalai Lama, China could name one who goes unchallenged.",
      "\u201cSadly, the PRC government probably will want to play a role, just as it inserted itself in the process of the recognition of the Panchen Lama,\u201d Jinpa said, referring to the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "In 1995, the Dalai Lama recognized a 6-year-old boy in Tibet as the 11th Panchen Lama, after the previous one died six years earlier. The boy was forcibly disappeared by the Chinese government three days later, rights groups say, and has not been seen in public since.",
      "China then chose its own Panchen Lama, imposing him on the six million people in Tibet.",
      "The Tibetan government-in-exile does not recognize the Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama, who rarely appears in public but pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party in a closed-door meeting last month with President Xi Jinping, state media reported.",
      "If Beijing also tries to name a Dalai Lama, \u201cTibetans would not be surprised,\u201d Jinpa said. \u201cThey would be disappointed and annoyed, but I don\u2019t think they would be surprised.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government says Tibet has prospered under its rule, and that it has improved infrastructure and social conditions and promoted economic development. It says the Dalai Lama is \u201ca political exile engaged in separatist activities under the guise of religion,\u201d and that the reincarnation of Tibetan lamas should be controlled by Beijing.",
      "Reincarnation \u201cmust comply with Chinese laws and regulations\u201d and \u201cfollow the process that consists of search and identification in China, lot-drawing from a golden urn, and central government approval,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in March."

    "story": [
      "There was no evidence of the onetime rivalry between President Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday as they came together in a common cause: opening an immigrant detention center in the swampy heart of Florida.",
      "Trump and his top deputies visited the Everglades, where Florida officials delivered a win for his anti-immigration agenda and positioned the state at the forefront of his crackdown.",
      "The facility, which Republican leaders dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d is set to house 3,000 detainees and took just eight days to construct.",
      "\u201cIt might be as good as the real Alcatraz,\u201d Trump told reporters Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a little controversial, but I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d",
      "The push behind \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d is not only to keep Florida aligned with Trump on immigration but also to reposition some of the state\u2019s biggest Republican players politically. DeSantis, for instance, fought vocally with Trump during the 2024 presidential primaries; during the visit Tuesday, however, he and Trump praised each other.",
      "\"You are my friend, and you\u2019ll always be my friend, and we may have some skirmishes, even in the future. I doubt it, but I will always come back, because we have blood that seems to match pretty well,\" Trump said.",
      "\u201cI think it is a 10,\u201d Trump added of their relationship. \u201cMaybe a 9.9. ... We get along great.\u201d",
      "DeSantis, unprompted, quickly chimed in with a reminder that he endorsed Trump as soon as he exited the presidential race in early 2024.",
      "\u201cThe thing about it is, I endorsed him,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cRaised one of his PACs millions and millions of dollars.\u201d",
      "Trump and DeSantis, along with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, toured the facility in a made-for-TV presentation of the opening of what is one of the largest immigrant detention facilities in the country.",
      "A number of the media outlets on the tour were Trump-friendly organizations, who asked questions that praised him or allowed him to hype his agenda.",
      "One reporter asked him to weigh in on the \u201cdisastrous handling of the border\u201d by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, while another had him comment on how his \u201cbeloved New York City may well be led by a communist soon.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s your message to Gov. Gavin Newsom?\u201d right-wing YouTube personality Benny Johnson asked.",
      "Trump responded that the \u201cfirst thing\u201d Newsom, the governor of California and a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, should do \u201cis come here and learn something.\u201d",
      "The political undertones of the event were hard to ignore. Among those Trump invited to attend was Rep. Byron Donalds, a Florida Republican running for governor in 2026. At the same time, DeSantis\u2019 wife, Casey DeSantis, continues to consider a competing run for governor.",
      "During a roundtable discussion Tuesday, Donalds \u2014 sitting just a couple of feet from DeSantis \u2014 said he \u201ccommended\u201d him for his work to combat illegal immigration. The moment represented political foes\u2019 setting aside their feud, at least for the day.",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, a close DeSantis ally, hatched the idea for Alligator Alcatraz last month, but it got national traction when DeSantis did a live tour of the facility Friday on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d which caught the Trump administration off-guard.",
      "Noem and top adviser Corey Lewandowski supported the facility but wanted the opening Tuesday to be the formal public rollout, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "\u201cDeSantis upset Noem and Lewandowski with his Fox News tour of the detention site,\u201d a Republican operative familiar with the process said. \u201cNoem wanted an event for Tuesday and didn\u2019t want anyone having eyes on the site and needed to push until Tuesday because she was traveling.\u201d",
      "The Republican operative said Noem\u2019s staff asked DeSantis not to do the Fox News tour.",
      "\u201cThe DHS team asked DeSantis not to do his Friday event,\u201d the person added. \u201cDeSantis did what was best for DeSantis and got out in front...angering both Noem and Lewandowski.\u201d",
      "Another source familiar with the matter said the ire did not stem directly from the White House but from Lewandowski.",
      "\u201cHe lost his s---,\u201d the person said.",
      "Lewandowski and DeSantis\u2019 political team did not respond to requests for comment. The White House called the assertion \u201cfake news.\u201d",
      "\u201cLeave it to the Fake News NBC to write about baseless gossip following a hugely successful event with President Trump, Secretary Noem and Governor DeSantis at Alligator Alcatraz,\u201d White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. \u201cHere\u2019s the real story that the state-of-the-art facility will play an important role in fulfilling the President\u2019s promise to keep Americans safe and deport criminal illegal aliens.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President is grateful to work with both Secretary Noem and Governor DeSantis on this project,\u201d she added.",
      "Still, the event signaled that DeSantis was publicly rekindling his relationship with Trump, and to some degree it was seen as a boon for his attempt to again regain national political footing for a potential presidential campaign in 2028, even as Vice President JD Vance is widely seen as the current front-runner.",
      "\u201cNo one thought Trump would so closely embrace DeSantis today,\u201d said a longtime Florida operative who was at the event. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think he would try to undercut him or insult him, but Trump was over the top in his praise today. I don\u2019t know what that means, but it was a good day for Ron DeSantis.\u201d",
      "The Everglades facility has given DeSantis and the state\u2019s Republican leaders, including Uthmeier, a boost to their fundraising efforts, even as Democrats have decried the effort as cruel to those accused of being in the country illegally.",
      "\u201c\u2018Alligator Alcatraz\u2019 is a callous political stunt,\u201d said David Jolly, a former Republican member of Congress who is running for governor as a Democrat in 2026. \u201cFlorida\u2019s most pressing challenge is the housing affordability crisis created by Republican leaders, not immigrants working to support our state\u2019s economy.\u201d",
      "Since the announcement of the facility, there have also been protests \u2014 including one Tuesday for the opening \u2014 and a lawsuit filed by environmental groups concerned over the impact it could have on the Everglades.",
      "The facility was made possible by DeSantis\u2019 using emergency powers he enacted in 2023. The state built what amounts to a tent city, hiring a dozen vendors and seizing land from Miami-Dade County over local leaders\u2019 objections. The facility is housed on a little-used airstrip that includes a runway that DeSantis said can be used to quickly fly undocumented immigrants to third countries if deportation is deemed appropriate."

      "\"This was too urgent, too important, to allow the process to unfold as it has for the last generation,\" he said after signing the bill.",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a pause in sending a shipment of missiles and ammunition to Ukraine amid concern about the U.S. military\u2019s stockpiles, according to two defense officials, two congressional officials and two sources with knowledge of the decision.",
      "Hegseth ordered the delay weeks after he issued a memo ordering a review of the U.S. stockpile of munitions, which has been depleted after years of the United States\u2019 sending weapons to Ukraine to defend against the Russia invasion, as well as nearly two years of military operations in the Middle East as the United States fought Houthi rebels in Yemen and defended Israel and allies against Iran, four of the officials said.",
      "The munitions and other weapons could be held up until the assessment is complete, the two defense officials and two congressional officials said, and if the munitions are in short supply or needed in other parts of the world, they could be held back even longer.",
      "The weapons being delayed include dozens of Patriot interceptors that can defend against incoming Russian missiles, thousands of 155 mm high explosive Howitzer munitions, more than 100 Hellfire missiles, more than 250 precision-guided missile systems known as GMLRS and dozens each of Stinger surface-to-air missiles, AIM air-to-air missiles and grenade launchers, the two defense officials, two congressional officials and two sources with knowledge of the decision said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said: \u201cThis decision was made to put America\u2019s interests first following a DOD review of our nation\u2019s military support and assistance to other countries across the globe. The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned \u2014 just ask Iran.\" The Defense Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "At a closing news conference after a NATO meeting at The Hague last week, President Donald Trump said the United States is trying to find Patriot air defense missiles to send to Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThey do want to have the anti-missile missiles,\u201d Trump said of Ukraine. \u201cAs they call them the Patriots, and we\u2019re going to see if we can make some available.\u201d He said that the United States is supplying weapons to Israel and that \u201cyou know, they\u2019re very hard to get. We need them, too.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the White House's announcement.",
      "Ukraine has repeatedly appealed for additional U.S. and European air defense weaponry as Russia has stepped up its air raids in recent months. Over the weekend, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Russia had launched the largest aerial attack on the country since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, firing 60 missiles and 477 drones.",
      "Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are also working to secure a permanent ceasefire. Though it\u2019s common for new administrations to pause weapons transfers to assess stockpiles, there are concerns about the moment in which this is happening, according to an official with knowledge of the situation. The official said Ukraine needs to appear strong to get Russia to the negotiating table.",
      "During a visit to Washington on June 5, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s top adviser, Andriy Yermak, told reporters that his country was holding off Russian forces but needed more air defense systems to safeguard its cities from Russian attacks.",
      "The munitions were approved as part of Presidential Drawdown Authority and Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative packages during the Biden administration, the defense officials and two sources with knowledge of the decision said. Some of the shipments are already in the region but have been stopped before being turned over to Ukraine, according to a defense official and two sources with knowledge of the decision.",
      "Last month, the acting chief of naval operations, Adm. James Kilby, warned during testimony before Congress that while the Navy has enough standard missiles, known as SM-3s, right now, the United States has been using some missiles and munitions \u201cat an alarming rate.\u201d"

      "In a note to the court just after 4 p.m. ET, the jury said it had made up its mind on the prosecution\u2019s two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.

He added: \u201cI like your shirt, your outfit.\u201d",
      "When the jury\u2019s afternoon note came in, the mood in the courtroom became tense. Diddy\u2019s defense team formed a tight horseshoe-shaped huddle around him for over 10 minutes. Diddy looked dejected and stared at the floor, hands folded in his lap. He later appeared to be wiggling his fingers as one of his attorneys whispered into his ear. His face was stone cold.",

I expected a relatively quick verdict on all but racketeering conspiracy, in part because that count was always the most complicated. Even the verdict form for count 1 takes up more page space than any of the other counts.",
      "Count 1 was always going to be tough for a jury. It\u2019s tough for the attorneys to understand, too.",

Or, you know, of course, if there\u2019s something that\u2019s planned way in advance, I\u2019ll hear about it, and I can say, \u201cWow, I love that.\u201d Or, \u201cHmm, I\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not in charge.",

      "Yeah, I think the chemistry, when you watch that kiss in Soul Ties, was palpable from watching it on the screen. When they said that they didn\u2019t feel any sparks, I was very confused because I feel like I saw sparks. That being said, you know, I think, honestly, I just want both of them to find whatever it is that they\u2019re looking for. And I\u2019m so happy that whatever it took to get Olandria a little bit away from thinking about Taylor, I think is a positive.",

      "I mean, I feel like Chelley and Ace, they took so long to actually couple up, which was interesting, because I felt like they had had this flirtation for so long, but you know, watching the episode with the heart-rate challenge, you see that Chelley still wants to remain open to Chris, so that\u2019s going to be interesting. I feel like Ace might be getting a little bit of a taste of his own medicine there, because he was really putting on the pressure when Chelley was with Austin. And now Chelley\u2019s with Ace, and Chris is putting on the pressure, so he feel knows what it feels like to be on the other side of that.",
      "Amaya and Zach. I think they\u2019re so cute. I love getting to see these little moments of them talk about cats or, you know, hula hooping in Casa. I just love the slice-of-life moments in the villa that we get to see because to me, that\u2019s when you really get to see what everyone\u2019s like around each other. So I hope we get to see more of that and more of them as well.",

      "I mean, I watch all the episodes, of course, and then you never know what\u2019s going to gain traction online, what\u2019s going to be something that people really connect with. And so with the \u201cmommy-mamacita\u201d moment, I feel like watching the episode, I thought that was a hilarious moment, but then when it took on a life of its own online, it made it even more fun. And I feel like I\u2019m constantly reposting people doing that audio now, because it\u2019s just too funny.",
      "Megan Thee Stallion came on the show! Let\u2019s talk about that iconic and surprising collaboration, as well as whether any other influential figures might be fans of the show.",
      "It\u2019s funny, because I feel like every year, we find more and more influential figures that are big fans. Or, even right now, with Olivia Rodrigo and Ed Sheeran doing the \u201cLove Island\u201d audio \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure Ed Sheeran communicates via email, so he probably does not watch \u201cLove Island USA\u201d \u2014 but to have Olivia explaining to him what is \u201cLove Island USA,\u201d to me, is a moment that I wish I could be a fly on the wall for because I can only imagine how funny that is. And Megan Thee Stallion, is someone I\u2019ve been a huge fan of for a very long time. I\u2019ve gone to see her live performing so many times, and getting to meet her, she is an absolute delight of a person. She has the most beautiful energy, and I\u2019m in love with her.",
      "Viewers didn\u2019t get to see the deliberation process when Hannah and Jeremiah left the villa, which Iain told us earlier was the most shocking thing he\u2019d seen all season long. What might be a little bit of the process behind that deliberation? If you heard anything, would you be able to speak on that?",
      "I wasn\u2019t in the villa that day, so I wasn\u2019t watching, you know, the monitors of what they were talking about. But considering that, it was a big moment, and when they\u2019re editing that episode and putting it together, my major guesstimation is that they really wanted to keep in other conversations that they felt were really important to the storyline. So maybe more showing him or other people talking earlier in the episode about things, and then maybe after the fact, they wanted to really be able to show more of what it was like when everyone was saying goodbye and stuff like that. And if the deliberation was redundant or boring or fairly inconsequential or not really different to what they were talking about outside of the actual deliberation, there\u2019s really no point in showing it.",
      "I know you didn\u2019t want to say earlier who you\u2019re rooting for this season, but is there a couple that maybe you\u2019re not as excited to see on your screen?",
      "I guess ... they\u2019re not a couple as of this point that I know of right now, but I am never excited to see Taylor be wishy-washy about who he wants to be in a couple with, and I\u2019m definitely never excited to see Olandria second-guess her worth. Those are two things I\u2019m never excited to see. So I am kind of hoping that she finds the right person for her and not someone who\u2019s wishy-washy about whether or not they want to be with her.",
      "What is the most shocking thing that you\u2019ve seen this season?",
      "Oh, I think Charlie\u2019s dumping was very shocking. I really did not expect that at all.",
      "Do you ever expect the dumps going in? What\u2019s the preparation process behind that?",
      "Sometimes you never really know. I feel like going in, it\u2019s a little bit of you can guess, or you can say, like, OK, I feel like I\u2019ve seen these two people become a little bit closer, but whether or not they\u2019re actually going to pick this person or that person \u2014 there\u2019s really no way to know. And it\u2019s really down to the moment, and the islanders make their decisions. And sometimes I\u2019m like, OK, that makes sense, I get it. And other times I\u2019m just completely shocked \u2014 like Charlie, for example.",
      "What\u2019s next for you?",
      "Well, I will be going back to Los Angeles, and I have a long list of things that I need to get done, and I will be back in the sandwich shop in West Hollywood. Please come see us \u2014 Something About Her \u2014 and have a sandwich. I\u2019ll be there for some time."

      "Broadway actress Jennie Harney-Fleming had just starting singing the encore at her solo concert in the New York City area when she heard a little voice yell: \"I want to go home!\"",
      "The heckler was none other than Harney-Fleming's 3-year-old daughter Olivia, who was up past her bedtime.",
      "Without missing a beat, Harney-Fleming said, \"Come here, baby. Come here, Olivia. Come to Mommy. It's too loud, I know.\"",
      "Wearing a fitted sequin dress and heels, Harney-Fleming picked Olivia up, returned to the mic and restarted the classic song \"Feeling Good.\" The video of Fleming singing the entire song while holding her daughter with one arm has garnered more than 2.7 million views on Instagram in 10 days ... plus the attention of celebrities.",
      "But in the moment, Olivia only wanted attention from one person: her mom.",
      "\"When I came back and started singing the second song, my daughter was like, 'Girl, we got to wrap this up!'\" Harney-Fleming tells TODAY.com.",
      "The concert began at 8pm and it was only an hour long, but that was way past bedtime for Olivia and her 5-year-old sister Ella. \"They did very well sitting through that show,\" Harney-Flemming shares. \"But I think my little one just reached her breaking point.\"",
      "The actress has grown used to changing plans on a dime. After all, before she played Angelica Schuyler in the Broadway company of \"Hamilton,\" she became the \"universal swing\" for the Schuyler sisters on tour in 2017. That meant that if any one of the actresses playing Angelica, Eliza or Peggy were sick in any production across the country, she would grab her suitcase of costumes, hop on a plane and perform on stage that evening.",
      "So when she heard Olivia complaining, Harney-Fleming says she  \"didn't give it a second thought. I think if we tried to deal with it any other way, she might have had a meltdown and caused a scene. I just knew what needed to be done and told her she was safe to come stay with me while I finish up the show.\"",
      "Another familiar face was on stage that evening: Olivia's father, DeWitt Fleming Jr., who was playing the drums.",
      "The actors first met \u2014 where else? \u2014 while starring in an off-Broadway show. And in late 2024, the couple enjoyed a musical dream: performing in principal roles in Broadway's \"A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical.\" Ella and Olivia spent every Saturday hanging out with their mom and dad backstage at the theater.",
      "\"It was important for them to see Mommy and Daddy on stage,\" Harney-Fleming says. \"We feel that it's very important to keep our children in the loop of what it means when we say we're going to work.\"",
      "Theater is in the girls' blood: Harney-Fleming's father received the Tony Award for his role as Curtis Taylor, Jr. in the original production of \"Dreamgirls.\"",
      "\"He went on to have a really wonderful career, but ultimately made the decision to leave the industry, both for ministry as well as for his family,\" says Harney-Flemming. \"That really left an indelible mark on me in terms of how I move through the industry now, and how we prioritize our time and our relationships in these professional spaces.\"",
      "Many notable performers expressed support for Harney-Fleming's viral video.",
      "The original Angelica Schuyler (and fellow Broadway mom) Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry wrote, \"Thank you for the master class!\"",
      "Natasha Bedingfield commented, \"I love this so much. \u2764\ufe0f Incredible mom and incredible singing.\"",
      "Holly Robinson Peete added, \"I needed this today,\" and Amy Schumer reposted the video.",
      "Questlove commented, \"I did this to my dad at MSG once in 1973 \u2026 Did not end like this lol.\"",
      "Harney-Fleming says she feels incredibly grateful for the support, and to answer the question everyone seemed to be asking: she's not sure how she sang a song with such incredible breath control while holding her daughter in one arm.",
      "\"Sometimes as a mom, you look back on your day and you're like, 'How the heck did I get all those things done?'\" she says. \"You rise to the occasion, and you don't give the workload a second thought. You just do it because it needs to be done.\""

      "What happens to Player 222 in the games?",
      "In a pivotal hide-and-seek challenge, Jun-hee breaks her ankle and goes into labor.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 19:00:01 GMT",
    "summary": "Katie Sturino opens up about writing her first novel and her role in the body positivity space.",
    "story": [
      "Katie Sturino opens her first novel with a scene that many of her readers will likely find uncomfortably familiar: Trying on a bathing suit in a well-lit dressing room and not liking what you see in the mirror.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a universal thing,\u201d Sturino tells TODAY.com. \u201cWho has not been able to find something in a store, and then left feeling like you triggered an eating disorder?\u201d",
      "The book's protagonist, Sunny, grapples with the feeling of being big in a world that wants her to be smaller. Sturino herself can relate.",
      "Her debut novel fits into the mission she\u2019s carved as a truth-teller speaking up around expectations of women\u2019s bodies as a multi-hyphenate entrepreneur, blogger and voice in the body positivity space.",
      "The book character Sunny shares obvious similarities with Sturino too. Sunny runs a PR company; Sturino ran a PR company for years. Sunny is getting over a divorce from an influencer; Sturino divorced Josh Ostrovsky, known as The Fat Jewish online, in 2017. Sunny loves her rescue dogs; Sturino\u2019s dogs had their own viral accounts. Sunny starts a business (swimsuits); Sturino started a business (personal care brand Megababe).",
      "\u201cThere are certainly a lot of things that are taken from my life,\u201d Sturino says, noting that the book's individuals are fictional \u2014 for the most part. She did base one of Sunny\u2019s suitors directly on her now-husband, John Forkin. \u201cI learned what good, healthy love looks like from him and I wanted to show that to people,\u201d she says.",
      "The character overlap is entirely on purpose: This is the book Sturino says she wanted after her divorce in 2017. \u201cThis book offers an alternative narrative to the typical breakup story, which is like, girl gets dumped, then, like gets a glow up and finds she\u2019s worthy of love,\u201d she says.",
      "The book defies typical narratives. Instead of a \u201crevenge body,\u201d for example, Sunny gains weight, just like Sturino did after her divorce. Sturino avoided the revenge-body trope on purpose. \u201cIt reinforces the idea that there is only one way to find to be worthy of love, and that is to be at your smallest, most fit body,\u201d she says.",
      "Sunny gets the guy and her happily ever after without trying to change who she is or how she looks. Still, Sunny's relationship with her body impacts every part of the plot. It\u2019s the inspiration for Sunny\u2019s swimsuit brand. It comes up when she\u2019s dating. It\u2019s in the haunting remarks of her ex. And yet she expresses frustration about it \u2014 she\u2019s tired of having to talk about her body.",
      "The press tour for \u201cSunny Side Up\u201d has often pointed to Sturino\u2019s own body and journey. Amid the interviews, Sturino opened up about using a type of weight-loss medication called a GLP-1 agonist to lower her A1C (a measure of blood sugar levels) after trying other interventions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that so often women are not allowed to just talk about their work without including the body narrative,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd by body, I really mean weight. I just don\u2019t think that we talk about men that way in the media, and it\u2019s pretty consistent that we talk about women like that.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think it\u2019s Jane Austen,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the greatest writers. She wrote a story for the ages, and the characters are complicated, and you get into the story, but they\u2019re not straightforward, and I think it all comes from that book.\u201d",

    "summary": "Queer love stories are as iconic as the LGBTQ+ community that it centers on. To highlight some of these stories, TODAY.com has compiled a list of 25 queer romance films to watch.",
    "story": [
      "Queer love stories have stood the test of time as filmmakers strive to tell authentic narratives, despite LGBTQ+ representation in films facing challenges throughout history.",
      "Films showcasing love in the LGBTQ+ community have been around for more than a century. Over time, they've become an important form of queer representation, helping to counter stereotypes and combat negative tropes in media.",
      "But, getting to this level of representation wasn\u2019t easy. While films depicting queer love were not formally banned, the Hays Code, also known as the Motion Picture Production Code, had Hollywood studios self-enforce a set of guidelines from around 1934 to 1968 to prevent government interference. Centered around \"moral standards\" and social values, the guidelines purported to ensure movies presented viewers with \"correct standards of life\" by banning profanity, obscenity and graphic violence. It also prevented overt or positive portrayals of LGBTQ+ relationships, according to a library guide from Ithaca College.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until the 1960s that the Hays Code was effectively challenged. The organization now known as the Motion Picture Association (MPA) established a film content rating system in 1968 which served as the code\u2019s replacement.",
      "Though it\u2019s been over 50 years since the Hays Code, and much progress has been made for LGBTQ+ representation in cinema, there still remain ongoing challenges for accurate and authentic narratives. The queer community continues to navigate a fickle film industry that periodically offers room for diverse storytelling, but can miss the mark with film tropes like the \u201cgay best friend,\u201d the \u201ccloseted bully\" or \"bury your gays,\" referring to a pattern of queer characters being killed off in shows and movies.",
      "Carlos King, CEO of Kingdom Reign Entertainment and a TV industry creative, tells TODAY.com that it\u2019s important to have authentic queer stories on screen so viewers can move past stereotypes and caricatures.",
      "\u201cI want to see (movies) starring queer people, not as being the sidekick to the main cast member or being the glam squad that we just see on television,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are leading. We have leading roles in our personal lives. We are executives. We\u2019re a vice president, presidents, CEOs of multiple companies.\u201d",
      "King says he strives to bring the representation \u2014 including that of love in the LGBTQ+ community \u2014\u00a0that he didn't have growing up to the screen.",
      "\u201cBeing a young gay Black boy from Detroit, Michigan, one of 10 siblings, I know all about desiring to look at a television screen and wanting to see someone like you reflected back,\" he says.",
      "Filmmaker Elegance Bratton, whose 2022 autobiographical breakout military drama, \u201cThe Inspection,\u201d received rave reviews from critics, tells TODAY.com that showing queer romance on screen helps to combat the negativity often felt in society.",
      "\u201cShowing love is always a good thing. We live in a world where hatred of queer people is reaching a fever point,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe need to see queer people loving on each other because it\u2019s real. We do love and that spirit is indomitable.\u201d",
      "Andrea Ambam, director of programming at Level Forward, a public benefit entertainment company, agrees, telling TODAY.com that seeing these stories on the big screen can help members of the LGBTQ+ community feel seen.",
      "\u201cI know and believe that queer films are important because of the way they\u2019re able to reach us through the screen,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way they\u2019re able to find, often, young people who may or may not be questioning their belonging in their homes, in their schools, in their communities, and they reach across the screen and say, \u2018You belong. You are here. There are more people like you.\u2019\u201d"

      "The munitions and other weapons could be held up until the assessment is complete, the two defense officials and two congressional officials said, and if the munitions are in short supply or needed in other parts of the world, they could be held back even longer.",
      "The weapons being delayed include dozens of Patriot interceptors that can defend against incoming Russian missiles, thousands of 155 mm high explosive Howitzer munitions, more than 100 Hellfire missiles, more than 250 precision-guided missile systems known as GMLRS and dozens each of Stinger surface-to-air missiles, AIM air-to-air missiles and grenade launchers, the two defense officials, two congressional officials and two sources with knowledge of the decision said.",

      "Despite apparent Iranian unwillingness, President Donald Trump is pushing for more talks with Tehran about its nuclear program. But Israel appears more interested in formalizing diplomatic relations with some of its long-standing adversaries, as well as ending the 18-month conflict in Gaza \u2014 which Trump has repeatedly pleaded for.",
      "\u201cThis victory presents an opportunity for a dramatic widening of peace agreements,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe are working on this with enthusiasm.\u201d",
      "The previous Trump administration brokered what it called the Abraham Accords, in which Israel established diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and later normalized its relations with Morocco in 2024 and Sudan, though that deal has yet to be ratified.",
      "Having devastated the powerful, Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, its northern neighbor, and seen a Tehran-friendly regime toppled in Syria to the east, Israel is now interested in establishing formal diplomatic relations with both countries, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday",
      "The shift represents a broader change in Israeli policy toward its neighbors. Until around two weeks ago, Israel\u2019s modus operandi was to assert military dominance as a political strategy, according to Michael Oren, who served as the country\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2009 to 2013.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s the first time that I\u2019ve seen in history when we have the opportunity to make the strategy the strategy. It\u2019s not a tactic,\u201d Oren, a former member of Israel\u2019s Knesset, or parliament, who served as deputy minister in the prime minister\u2019s office, told NBC News in a phone call on Friday.",
      "Before the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel relied on a method known in Hebrew as \u201cmowing the grass.\u201d The term was used by strategists to describe the country\u2019s periodic attacks against Palestinian militants and their supply of weapons in Gaza, attacks that faced widespread criticism from rights groups often because of the disproportionate number of deaths caused by Israeli forces.",
      "The phrase could also apply to Israel's behavior toward Iran and its proxies in taking out military commanders, nuclear scientists and senior advisers to the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while attacking nuclear and military sites. In Lebanon, it has wiped out large swaths of Hezbollah\u2019s leadership.",
      "Today, Netanyahu\u2019s most formidable challenge will be finding a resolution to end the conflict in Gaza, where, despite nearly 20 months of war, Hamas remains nominally in control.",
      "Under pressure from Trump, who on Truth Social on Sunday again called for a \u201cdeal in Gaza\u201d and to \u201cget the hostages back,\u201d the negotiations are also still captive to the same disagreements that have long delayed a deal.",
      "Hamas has refused to release its remaining hostages and surrender \u2014 key demands of far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, his national security minister, both of whom have threatened to quit and bring down the fragile coalition if he does otherwise. Along with other lawmakers they have also called for the complete destruction of Hamas.",
      "Hamas, meanwhile, has demanded a permanent truce, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and guarantees about humanitarian aid.",
      "The decline of power in Iran, Hamas' primary patron, will likely sap the group\u2019s confidence and influence, according to Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research center.",
      "\u201cFrom an Israeli standpoint, this is a dramatic shift in the acceptance for the Jewish state in the region,\u201d added Plesner, a former member of the Israeli parliament.",
      "But he cautioned that as long as Hamas is the governing body in Gaza, a deal to end the war there \u201cwill be something that is possible but it will be very difficult for the Israeli government to swallow.\u201d",
      "For now, Israel is in the ascendancy: Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been badly damaged, its 46-year-old Islamic regime is weakened and its proxy groups and allies throughout the region have been extensively damaged.",
      "Perhaps most important is that while the Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iran were publicly criticized, they were also quietly welcomed by its Arab neighbors, many of whom were quicker to condemn Iran\u2019s reprisal attack on the U.S. military base in Qatar than the American attack on Iran.",
      "For decades Iran has fostered allied regimes and proxy militia throughout the Middle East in order to fight Israel, its major ally in the region, the United States, and Shiite-majority Iran\u2019s adversaries among the Sunni-led Gulf kingdoms.",
      "Israel will now need those states to blaze a path toward an enduring peace, analysts said, or risk inflaming regional conflict even more.",
      "\u201cI think we see imperial Iran is in retreat,\u201d Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an associate professor of political science at the United Arab Emirates University in Al Ain, said in a phone interview last week. \u201cIt probably means a more stable Middle East, a more stable region.\u201d",
      "Israel and the United States would do better to cultivate what Abdullah described as an \u201cAxis of Moderation\u201d of monied Gulf Arab kingdoms, many of whom have normalized relations with Israel \u2014 a play on the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d used to describe Iran and its regional proxy groups that Israel has largely defeated.",
      "Israel has nonetheless made clear its intention to continue attacking Iran\u2019s nuclear program should a perceived need arise. And in Gaza and Lebanon, it has continued to launch regular strikes against what it says are militant targets long after ceasefires were put in place.",
      "But Trump, whose angry outburst appeared to rein in an Israeli strike on Iran after he declared a ceasefire in the region, has shown he is capable of halting Israel\u2019s responses. Oren said this could help pave the way toward lasting stability by restraining Israel\u2019s more militant instincts.",
      "\u201cThe difference between tactics and strategy is in the hands of Donald Trump,\u201d Oren said. \u201cTo the greatest extent in Israel\u2019s history, our fate is in the hands of one person, and it\u2019s not the prime minister.\u201d"

      "Local foxes, that is.",
      "The building, which is under construction, has been nicknamed the \"landscraper\" because it spans 1,082 feet wide and 11 floors tall.",
      "Created by British designer Thomas Heatherwick, it will reportedly be completed later this year and cost the tech giant upwards of \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion). Construction began in 2017. It is anticipated to eventually house up to 7,000 Google employees.",
      "For now, however, some of the more frequent visitors might be the foxes that have been digging burrows in the manicured grounds and leaving their droppings behind on the building's nearly 1,000-foot-long rooftop garden.",
      "\u201cFox sightings at construction sites are pretty common, and our King\u2019s Cross development is no exception,\u201d a Google spokesperson told NBC News. But, the person added, \u201cWhile foxes have been occasionally spotted at the site, their appearances have been brief and have had minimal impact on the ongoing construction.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke to nearly two dozen construction workers at the construction site, where a cacophony of noise from the drilling and hammering filled the streets as dust dispersed into the air. But when asked whether they had seen any foxes, most refused to comment, citing nondisclosure agreements.",
      "One worker, who requested anonymity due to the NDA, told NBC News, \u201cPersonally, I haven\u2019t seen one, but there are so many open entrances to the building I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it had gotten inside.\u201d",
      "Still, Kareen Mascerenhas, 25, who works at a store directly across from the construction site, said she had spotted a fox last winter. \u201cI was shutting the store when I saw one just run past that side and in there,\u201d she said, pointing to Google\u2019s construction.",
      "But any sightings of the bushy-tailed vulpines feel neither rare nor unique in a city where the number of foxes soars between 10,000 and 15,000, accounting for nearly 16 foxes per square mile.",
      "Around the country, their population ebbs and flows depending on the season, from 150,000 in the winter to around 400,000 during cub season, according to Terry Woods, who founded the fox removal company Fox-a-Gon, which advocates for the humane treatment of the animals.",
      "For decades, foxes have also captured the British imagination, appearing as the sly character Mr. Tod in Beatrix Potter's novels, and in Roald Dahl's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" And most recently, one even served as a memorable symbol for the \u201chot priest\u201d in the hit television show \"Fleabag\" by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.",
      "Though they are often seen boldly trotting along sidewalks and rummaging through residential bins, foxes have also roused strong reactions from onlookers, ranging from adoration to outright resentment.",
      "\u201cThey may appear cuddly and romantic, but foxes are also a pest and a menace, particularly in our cities,\u201d former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News in 2013, then as the mayor of London, when a fox horrified the British public after biting off a baby\u2019s finger.",
      "For years, foxes perfectly concealed their identity as the main culprits behind hundreds of cat mutilations in the south London suburb of Croydon, where the grisly carcasses strewn across streets and backyards led distressed residents to suspect that a deranged cat killer was on the loose until police realized what was happening in 2018.",
      "While some residents cherish their presence, hoping to charm the typically contact-averse creatures by trying to feed them, a series of British wildlife laws also gives foxes the protection and freedom to roam the United Kingdom\u2019s cities endlessly.",
      "\u201cFoxes are quite popular around this area; they are just virtually everywhere,\u201d said 31-year-old Ode Tomitoba, who works at the King\u2019s Cross Visitors Center.",
      "For Hanei Mokenen, 23, who manages a restaurant in King\u2019s Cross, news of the latest fox incursion came by way of a TikTok video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, anything can happen here,\u201d he said about the bustling commercial neighborhood in Central London, adding that he had occasionally seen a fox running around the area.",
      "But their stealth around the giant Google edifice had nonetheless taken Mokenen by surprise. \u201cHow the hell did they get inside? Security is strong in this area; it\u2019s not a place where you can just walk around,\u201d he said.",
      "The foxes\u2019 newfound home at Google\u2019s offices isn\u2019t the first time the animals have made themselves comfortable in London\u2019s skyscrapers. In 2011, a fox called Romeo was discovered living in The Shard, surviving on the food scraps left by construction workers.",
      "\u201cIt is a fairly common occurrence with the creatures being so adaptable,\u201d said Woods from Fox-a-Gon, who helped remove Romeo from the site by capturing him safely and releasing him back into the urban jungle.",
      "\u201cThey are such an adaptable animal that they can survive almost anywhere and overcome great hardships,\u201d he added."

    "story": [
      "Sitting off the Horn of Africa, the Yemeni island of Socotra was largely left to its own devices for centuries, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense, the healing plant aloe and the crimson sap of the dragon\u2019s blood tree, used for dyes.",
      "Roughly the size of New York\u2019s Long Island, Socotra is about 140 miles off the coast of Somalia, a remote location that has allowed a unique ecosystem to flourish. It has a rich array of bird and animal life, and the coral reefs off its shores teem with colorful marine life. One-third of its 825 plant species cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, according to UNESCO.",
      "Some, including conservationist Kay Van Damme, have called it the Gal\u00e1pagos of the Indian Ocean and along with other experts, he is warning that millions of years of evolution on Socotra could be under \u201cserious threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cClimate change is by far the biggest threat to the island\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Van Damme, who has worked on Socotra for more than two decades, told NBC News in a call last month. \u201cIt is a relatively small island with a predominantly arid climate. Even small additional impacts from climate change can have an outsized effect, putting further pressure on fragile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "Prolonged droughts brought on by climate change are compounding damage from devastating cyclones in 2015 and 2018 that destroyed reefs, eroded soil and uprooted rare plants.",
      "The island\u2019s lifeblood, endemic species of frankincense trees, are also under threat. Four of the 11 recognized species on the island were classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in March.",
      "Five were recognized as endangered.\u201cTheir decline reflects the wider degradation of terrestrial habitats across the island and the ecosystems they support,\u201d said Van Damme, adding that overgrazing \u2014 predominantly from goats \u2014 is another significant challenge, leading to habitat degradation and \u201cleaving behind overmature trees with fewer younger trees to replace them.\u201d",
      "Tourism\u2019s growing footprint",
      "Attracted by Socotra\u2019s pristine beaches, turquoise waters and surreal flora, tourists are also placing mounting pressure on the island\u2019s fragile ecosystem.",
      "While there is only a handful of hotels, mostly in the capital Hadibo, a growing number of tour operators offer luxury camping and 4x4 tours around the island, some of which are packaged as ecotourism.",
      "Authorities have agreed to limit the number of tourists to around 4,500 per year, Ali Yahya, a local conservationist and tour operator, said in an interview last month, adding that when it came to \u201cvery sensitive areas in terms of ecosystems, biodiversity and cultural heritage, it\u2019s strictly not allowed to build any big buildings or large-scale hotels.\u201d",
      "But despite Socotra\u2019s UNESCO World Heritage designation \u2014 requiring preservation under international agreements \u2014 violations occur frequently, another local guide, Abdulraoof al-Gamhi, said in a series of voice and written messages last month.",
      "\u201cSome tourists build fires under dragon blood trees, carve inscriptions into rare trees, leave trash behind them and scare birds with their drones,\u201d he said. But he added that many of the island\u2019s residents benefit from tourism and that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for \u201ctour companies, car owners, drivers, restaurants, hotels and sellers of handcrafts.\u201d",
      "Echoing his concerns, Van Damme also said endangered species were \u201cbeing killed just for a selfie,\u201d with rare species like chameleons being captured so tourists can take pictures with them.",
      "Al-Gamhi also said he expected the number of tourists to rise as more people discover the unique locale, and \u201cthat will put a lot of pressure on our environment.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will be a big challenge,\u201d he added.",
      "A cautionary tale",
      "Although the Gal\u00e1pagos comparison is often used to celebrate Socotra\u2019s biodiversity, it can also serve as a warning, according to Van Damme, who co-authored a 2011 study on human impacts on the island.",
      "Since the 19th century, the Gal\u00e1pagos, remote islands some 600 miles off the coast of mainland Ecuador known for their unique flora and fauna, have lost numerous endemic species to habitat disruption, overtourism and invasive species.",
      "\u201cPerhaps Socotran ecosystems,\u201d Van Damme wrote at the time, \u201ccould now be considered as having at least, a similar state of health of those in the Gal\u00e1pagos at the time of [the Ecuadorian islands\u2019] nomination as world heritage site 30 years ago.\u201d He added that Socotra risked a similar fate without \u201ctimely conservation efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we consider the present-day condition in the Gal\u00e1pagos, we might catch a glimpse of Socotra\u2019s future, or better, what could happen if trends and threats continue in parallel,\u201d the paper added.",
      "That assessment \u201cturned out to be very predictive,\u201d particularly in terms of climate change, he told NBC News.",
      "The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands now host over 250,000 annual visitors, under strict controls including visitor caps, mandatory guides, designated trails and substantial tourism fees, which fund conservation.",
      "Socotra needs to implement similar protections before damage becomes irreversible, Van Damme said.",
      "Culture and tradition",
      "Beyond the environment, there are signs that tourism is also eroding the island\u2019s social fabric, according to Yahya, who said there was already a \u201ccultural shift\u201d among its 60,000 residents, many of whom remain deeply traditional and speak Soqotri, an ancient, unwritten language with pre-Islamic roots.",
      "\u201cInternational behaviors are influencing locals, and we worry about the erosion of our traditions,\u201d he said, adding that while tourists were welcome, some of them needed to be more respectful.",
      "An Instagram picture of a woman posing in a bikini beneath a dragon\u2019s blood tree had upset residents of one mountain village, he said, adding that it was seen as highly disrespectful by the conservative residents.",
      "Despite the pressures, there are reasons to be positive, Van Damme said, noting that authorities on the island are open to collaboration and local conservation projects are gaining traction.",
      "\u201cCommunity-led and other ongoing initiatives are vital,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they continue, there\u2019s genuine hope for the island\u2019s future.\u201d"

      "Humanoid robots waddled, stumbled and occasionally face-planted their way through a 3-on-3 soccer tournament in Beijing on Saturday that looked more like the first day of little league than the rise of a robotic Lionel Messi.",
      "Pileups were frequent as players toppled over each other in slow-motion collisions, goals were left open, and defending appeared optional. Some robots hogged the ball, others struggled to stay upright, and two or three had to be loaded onto a stretcher and carried off the field.",
      "While the play was absurd, the tech powering it was anything but.",
      "Each team operated fully autonomously, driven by AI, with no human intervention or supervision \u2014 an impressive breakthrough somewhat masked by the slapstick spectacle playing out on the field.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the child-sized robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with some halting agility. They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling, though some did require the help of biological humans, including one who was dragged off the field after tipping over near the goal.",

By 2050, China is expected to have 302.3 million humanoid robots in use, far ahead of the U.S. projection of 77.7 million, the report added, noting these would likely be used for \u201crepetitive, simple, and structured work,\u201d like in factories.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming apparent that national support for \u2018embodied AI\u2019 may be far greater in China than in any other nation, driving continued innovation,\u201d said Sheng Zhong, Morgan Stanley\u2019s head of industrials research. \u201cIn our opinion, China\u2019s lead in AI-robotics may need to widen before rivals, including the U.S., pay closer attention.\u201d",
      "Sports is becoming a key part of China\u2019s push.",
      "In April, 21 humanoid robots recently competed alongside humans in a half-marathon in Beijing, though only six managed to finish. Saturday\u2019s soccer match also served as a preview for the upcoming 2025 World Humanoid Robot Games, which China will host in Beijing Aug. 15\u201317. The event will feature 11 robot sports, including gymnastics, track and field, and soccer.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics \u2014 the company that supplied the robot players at Saturday\u2019s soccer tournament \u2014 said sports competitions are a testing ground for humanoid robots. Their successes and stumbles on the field help accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also explained that safety is a core concern about humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play soccer with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,\u201d Cheng said, referring to a perceived risk that a heavy robot could fall on and injure a human athlete, for example.",
      "\u201cA robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn\u2019t matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place. That would help audiences build trust and understand that robots are safe,\u201d he said.",
      "Ironically, China\u2019s humanoids may be more entertaining than their human counterparts.",
      "With the men\u2019s national team languishing at 94th in the FIFA rankings and likely to miss out on the next World Cup, the robots at least know how to put on a show \u2014 and score.",
      "In the final, Tsinghua University\u2019s THU Robotics defeated China Agricultural University\u2019s Mountain Sea team 5\u20133 to take the championship. No shortage of goals, and no complaints from the cheering crowd."

It also drastically reduced Iran\u2019s stockpile of uranium, limited its use of centrifuges and relied on the IAEA to oversee Tehran\u2019s compliance through additional oversight.",

That set in motion years of tensions, including attacks at sea and on land.",
      "Iran had been enriching up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. It also has enough of a stockpile to build multiple nuclear bombs, should it choose to do so. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003."

      "\u201cI am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,\u201d said the Dalai Lama, who has spent almost 70 years living in exile in India after fleeing Tibet, an autonomous Himalayan region of China.",
      "\u201cI hereby reiterate that the Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognize the future reincarnation,\u201d he said, referring to an organization he founded. \u201cNo one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation.

    "story": [
      "The young man said he\u2019s lived in fear ever since he developed an addiction to drugs and later fell prey to drug trafficking in Guanajuato, central Mexico. \u201cUnfortunately, they\u2019ve already killed my best friend and my relatives,\u201d said the 19-year-old, whose name is being withheld since he's afraid of reprisals.",
      "\u201cDrug addiction led me to a critical condition. I couldn\u2019t find a way out, and I was scared,\u201d he told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "A year ago, he managed to escape from a panic house (also known as panicueva, or panic cave) commonly used by organized crime gangs in Mexico. Some of these buildings, located in Guanajuato and other states where drug use is rampant, also serve as recruitment bases for young people selected to become hit men and operatives for these criminal groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the place where you can go, buy your drugs, and get high right there,\u201d said another 19-year-old who managed to escape a panic house and was interviewed by Noticias Telemundo on the condition that he remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.",
      "\"I entered a panic house and saw several women who had to prostitute themselves, and several of my friends got involved in selling drugs and ended up being killed,\u201d said the young man. He said he spent five years living in one of the houses and eventually joined a local gang.",
      "According to the latest report issued by the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the highest number of homicides (980 from January to April). In February, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the Victimization and Security Perception Survey revealed that 87.5% of the population in Guanajuato considered public safety to be the most serious problem in the state.",
      "\"They've put a gun to my head, they\u2019ve threatened me, they\u2019ve told me I\u2019m done, that\u2019s it. But the most horrible thing I\u2019ve seen is how they killed my best friend,\u201d the young man said, referring to his experience in the shelters.",
      "\u201cI was required to do many things ... they send us to train to use a firearm, all of that comes together and from there come the hit men, from there come the thieves, the hawks,\u201d he said, referring to the murderers, thieves and drug traffickers.",
      "'They are recruiting more minors'",
      "Guanajuato is grappling with gang clashes over criminal activities such as fuel trafficking, and is also the epicenter of a growing methamphetamine epidemic. According to data from the Federal Ministry of Health, the addiction rate to this drug in the state grew 449% over the past 20 years.",
      "For David Miranda, a counselor at the Las Joyas de Le\u00f3n Addiction Assistance Center, a civil association, the rise in methamphetamine use is creating a social crisis in the state.",
      "\"They're recruiting more minors, ages 12 to 17,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cWithin these 'panic houses,' they recruit many minors who are now hit men.\u201d",
      "Noticias Telemundo visited the Las Joyas neighborhood in the municipality of Le\u00f3n, where, according to the state\u2019s Security Secretariat, criminal groups have taken over a 380-unit housing complex.",
      "\u201cThe situation in Le\u00f3n right now is demanding and very serious,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cInside those houses there are women, girls, minors, and you see drug trafficking, trafficking of women, trafficking of everything.\"",
      "Most panic houses are in working-class neighborhoods like Las Joyas. According to the state government, there could be up to 60,000 homes across Guanajuato currently being used for illegal drug use.",
      "\u201cIn fact, you can see a panic house on any corner, anywhere. It\u2019s very easy to find them. There are many abandoned houses,\u201d one of the young men interviewed by Noticias Telemundo said.",
      "'I don\u2019t want to be caught again'",
      "According to state figures, at least 10 people have been murdered in panic houses in the last two years, and around 400 neighborhoods in the state are struggling with high crime rates.",
      "\u201cLe\u00f3n is the number one city in terms of drug dealing,\u201d said Juan Mauro Gonz\u00e1lez, Guanajuato\u2019s secretary of security.",
      "\"Drug houses\" aren\u2019t unique to Mexico; similar trends exist in other countries, such as drug houses in the United States or drug dens in Spain. \u201cWhile criminals may be attracted to abandoned houses, these are also spaces where potential victims and criminals tend to converge without surveillance. Our results support the idea that abandoned houses also generate crime,\u201d said Lauren C. Porter, a professor at the University of Maryland who co-wrote a study on the issue.",
      "\"The most important thing to rehabilitate people is to change their mindset. They have to say they don\u2019t want that anymore, that they no longer want to suffer or be in that world where they were humiliated, abused, and forced to do things. They should want a different life; we do the rest and we help them,\u201d said Miranda, who said his addiction center has a capacity to serve 150 people.",
      "Meanwhile, young people like the ones interviewed by Noticias Telemundo continue to struggle to avoid falling back into addiction and the dangers of the \"haunted houses\" that abound on some areas of Guanajuato.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t want them to catch me again and force me to do things,\u201d said one of the men, who told Noticias Telemundo he wants to move to another neighborhood and have an honest job as a pizza maker, as he enjoys feeding people.",
      "\u201cMy life is already very ruined, I was very humiliated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to make a change.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 It was not her best goal or most important soccer match, but when the ball hit the back of the net in Natalie Washington's debut on a women's team in 2017, she felt a sense of belonging that had been missing.",
      "It was long in coming: Washington had struggled to fit in on a men's team and eventually stopped playing when she decided to transition to being a woman and go through gender-affirming surgery. When she joined a women's team, she quickly felt accepted.",
      "Now, after the United Kingdom's highest court in April said that for anti-discrimination purposes the terms \"woman\" and \"man\" refer to biological sex, Washington's opportunity to play the sport she loves in the league she wants is in doubt.",
      "The head of the U.K's Equality and Human Rights Commission followed the ruling a day later by saying the court had provided clarity and that transgender women would be excluded from women-only spaces such as toilets, single-sex hospital wards and sports teams.",
      "The Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in the U.K., followed up by banning transgender players from women's teams in England and Scotland, a ban that took effect at the start of June.",
      "\"It feels like things are being taken away from trans people on an almost daily basis,\" Washington said. \"It's another blow, another kick at a time when people are already hurting.\"",
      "Long a divisive issue",
      "Beyond Britain, inclusion of trans players in sports has long been a divisive issue, with arguments primarily focused on whether it's fair to have athletes born as boys compete against girls and women. In the U.S., it has been particularly politicized, with most Republican-controlled states banning transgender athletes in girls' sports and President Donald Trump signing an executive order to prohibit participation of transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports.",
      "The U.K. court said trans people were still protected from discrimination under British law, such as in employment, housing and education, but the ruling means access to certain single-sex facilities could be curtailed.",
      "Trans rights groups condemned the decision, which is likely to have a profound effect for thousands. Out of some 66 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count.",
      "The feminist groups who led the legal challenge cheered the ruling and others, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, welcomed the clarity it brought.",
      "\"Everyone knows what sex is and you can't change it,\" said Susan Smith, co-director of For Women Scotland, which brought the case.",
      "A difficult decision",
      "Washington, who leads the group Football v Transphobia, was one of 28 transgender women registered with the Football Association to play amateur soccer. In order to play the women's game, they had to have testosterone levels reduced to the range of biologically born females.",
      "After the ruling, the organization changed its rules, saying that although it had aimed to make soccer accessible to as many people as possible, it was always prepared to alter its policy if there were changes in the law or science.",
      "\"We understand that this will be difficult for people who simply want to play the game they love in the gender by which they identify,\" the FA said, adding that it would contact transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can remain involved.",
      "Some clubs have responded by finding ways around the ban. Goal Diggers FC, a women and nonbinary inclusive soccer club based in London, has withdrawn from all FA-affiliated leagues.",
      "On June 1, the day the ban took effect, Goal Diggers hosted an inclusive women's tournament in London, drawing more than 100 players in a show of solidarity.",
      "\"I'll always have a place here and I'll always be a trans woman,\" said Billie Sky, a 28-year-old trans player for Goal Diggers. \"No one can take that away from me.\"",
      "Other voices, other sports",
      "Groups that have campaigned to keep trans athletes from girls' and women's teams, citing a matter of safety and fairness, welcomed the move by the FA.",
      "\"The FA had ample evidence of the harms to women and girls caused by its nonsensical policy of letting men who identify as women play in women's teams,\" said Fiona McAnena of Sex Matters.",
      "Groups that oversee cricket and netball, an offshoot of basketball that is played mainly by women, also limited women's competition to those who were assigned at birth as females.",
      "The England and Wales Cricket Board said transgender women and girls could continue playing in open and mixed cricket. England Netball said it would allow anyone to play in a new mixed category beginning in September.",
      "How the ruling came about",
      "The legal case involved a 2018 Scottish law requiring at least half of the seats on public boards to be held by women. Trans women with certificates recognizing their gender were to be included in meeting the quota.",
      "The court said that using the certificates to identify someone's gender clashes with the definitions of man and woman. Under the ruling, a transgender person could not claim they had been discriminated against if barred from a single-sex space.",
      "Alexander Maine, a senior lecturer at The City Law School specializing in gender, sexuality and law, said the ruling clouds the value of a document sanctioned by the U.K. Gender Recognition Act that allows them to later update their birth certificate reflecting their acquired gender.",
      "\"There may be a challenge at the European Court of Human Rights brought by trans individuals who say that there is a problem where they may be two sexes at once,\" Maine said.",
      "Someone could hold \"a gender recognition certificate stating that they are their acquired gender, whereas under the U.K. Equality Act, they are still recognized in their birth gender,\" he said.",
      "Washington and many others say they worry the ruling may lead to more hatred aimed at trans people.",
      "\"For the first time in a long time, I felt scared about how people are going to react to me in public,\" Washington said. \"I don't feel anymore that I can guarantee I have support to turn to from authorities.\""

    "summary": "A Thai court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office Tuesday pending investigation over a leaked phone call with a senior Cambodian leader.",
    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 Thailand's Constitutional Court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday, pending an ethics investigation over accusations that she was too deferential to a senior Cambodian leader when the two discussed a recent border dispute in a phone call that was leaked.",
      "Paetongtarn has faced growing dissatisfaction over her handling of the dispute, which involved an armed confrontation on May 28, in which one Cambodian soldier was killed. In a call with Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, she attempted to defuse tensions \u2014 but instead set off a string of complaints and public protests by critics who accused her of being too fawning.",
      "Familiar pattern",
      "Paetongtarn's suspension raises the possibility of renewed instability in Thailand, a still fragile democracy that has suffered several similar bouts of uncertainty. At the root of much of that were concerns from the conservative establishment, including the military, that the political dynasty started by Paetongtarn's father, the popular but divisive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was growing too powerful.",
      "She is the third member of her family to hold the prime minister's office \u2014 and the third to face the possibility of removal before her term ended. Thaksin was removed from office in a 2006 coup and driven into exile, while his sister, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawtra, was removed by a court order in 2014, followed shortly after by a coup.",
      "This \"recurring cycle of political instability\" would likely keep repeating unless Thailand goes through a genuine democratic reform that includes limiting power of unelected institutions, said Purawich Watanasukh, a political science lecturer at Thammasat University in Bangkok.",
      "\"Without such foundational reforms, any government, regardless of who leads it, will remain vulnerable to the same forces that have repeatedly disrupted Thailand's democratic development,\" he said.",
      "Growing discontent",
      "The suspension also comes at a time when the country is facing an economic slowdown and growing discontent with Paetongtarn and her Pheu Thai party, in general, with critics saying her government's performance has been underwhelming.",
      "The judges voted unanimously Tuesday to review the petition accusing her of a breach of the ethics, and voted 7-2 to immediately suspend her from duty as a prime minister until a ruling is given. The court gave Paetongtarn 15 days to give evidence to support her case.",
      "After the court order, Paetongtarn said that she would accept the process and defended her actions.",
      "\"I only thought about what to do to avoid troubles, what to do to avoid armed confrontation, for the soldiers not to suffer any loss,\" she said.",
      "She also apologized to people upset over the leaked call and left the Government House shortly after.",
      "Suriya Jungrungruangkit, who is a deputy prime minister and a transport minister, will take charge as acting prime minister, said Chousak Sirinil, minister of the prime minister's office.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, before the court suspended Paetongtarn, King Maha Vajiralongkorn had endorsed a Cabinet reshuffle after a major party left the government coalition over the leaked call.",
      "In the reshuffle, Paetongtarn also received the position of culture minister, in addition to prime minister, though it's not clear if she can take the oath to take up that role.",
      "In the call about the border tensions, Paetongtarn could be heard urging Hun Sen \u2014 a longtime friend of her father \u2014 not to listen to a Thai regional army commander who had publicly criticized Cambodia about the border dispute, and called him \"an opponent.\"",
      "Thousands of conservative, nationalist-leaning protesters rallied in central Bangkok on Saturday to demand Paetongtarn's resignation.",
      "Paetongtarn also faces separate investigations by another agency over the leaked call \u2014 a case that could also lead to her removal.",
      "The Constitutional Court last year removed Paetongtarn's predecessor over a breach of ethics. Thailand's courts, especially the Constitutional Court, are viewed as a defender of the royalist establishment, which has used them and nominally independent agencies such as the Election Commission to cripple or sink political opponents.",
      "Fallout from leaked call",
      "Paetongtarn, 38, is the youngest daughter of Thaksin. Her father has remained beloved by many of the Thailand's poor and working classes who long saw him as their champion.",
      "But the family's political fortunes now may be on the wane.",
      "Thaksin alienated many of his supporters with what looked like a self-serving deal with his former conservative opponents. It allowed his return from exile in 2023 and the party he supported to form the new government, while sidelining the progressive Move Forward Party, which finished first in a national election, but was seen by the conservative establishment as a greater threat.",
      "Thaksin has faced several legal challenges since his return. On Tuesday, he attended a court hearing in a case alleging he defamed the monarchy in 2015.",
      "He also is under investigation over the handling of his return to face an eight-year prison term on charges related to corruption and abuse of power. At the time, he was transferred almost immediately to a hospital, and later granted clemency because of his age and health without spending a single night in jail.",
      "The complaints argue he avoided properly serving his sentence and raise the possibility that Thaksin could be forced to serve prison time."

      "As many of his fellow Britons cope with a cost-of-living crisis, the grant which is paid for by the public and used for royal spending and upkeep of royal assets, remained at around 86 million pounds ($110 million) for the 2024-2025 year, latest annual figures from the Crown Estate showed. The grant will rise to around $170 million next year and remain stable for 2026-2027.",
      "The increase of more than 53% came as the monarchy reported record offshore wind farm profits to the Crown Estate, which is a vast royal collection of land and property across the United Kingdom. This will be used primarily to fund the ongoing refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, according to a Sovereign Grant report released Tuesday.",
      "Funded by the taxpayer, the Sovereign Grant is used to support the official duties of the monarch and other costs such as official travel, thousands of engagements, staff for working royals and the maintenance of occupied palaces.",
      "It is based on a proportion of profits from the Crown Estate, an independently managed portfolio of assets, including luxury properties in central London, historical estates, rural land and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland worth around 15 billion pounds ($20.6 billion).",
      "The assets are hereditary possessions held \u201cin right of the Crown,\u201d the profits of which are added to Britain\u2019s Treasury. The grant is reviewed every five years, and is expected to next be reviewed through legislation in 2026-27 to keep funding for the royal family at an \u201cappropriate\u201d level.",
      "Control of the estate was surrendered in 1760 by King George III in exchange for a percentage of the profits.",
      "In addition, the king receives income via the Privy Purse from the Duchy of Lancaster, a landed estate, while William, the Prince of Wales, receives the net profits from the Duchy of Cornwall.",
      "Separately, the royal family also received additional income of 21.5 million pounds ($29 million) from a record year of visitors to Buckingham Palace.",
      "The monarchy\u2019s gross share has soared since the Crown Estate clocked in a net revenue profit of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) in 2024-25, which included \u201cexceptional short-term uplift from Offshore Wind Leasing,\u201d Dan Labbad, its chief executive, said in a separate report released Tuesday.",
      "Part of the Sovereign Grant is being used to fund Buckingham Palace\u2019s 10-year, 369 million pounds ($475 million) \u201creservicing,\u201d which includes modernizing building services, new lifts and mechanical pipework. The monarchy has already spent 266.5 million pounds ($367 million) of the agreed servicing amount, the grant said.",
      "The expenses also included more than 800 royal events with almost 100,000 guests, 539 full-time staff.",
      "In February, Charles took delivery of two new helicopters to replace the existing 15-year-old helicopters \u201cdue to their unique capability to access remote regions of the U.K. that are not otherwise readily served,\u201d the report said.",

      "The death toll from a massive explosion and fire at a pharmaceutical factory in India\u2019s southern state of Telangana has risen to at least 36 while about three dozen were left injured, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "The fire department recovered the charred bodies of 34 workers from the accident site in an industrial area about 31 miles from the state capital, Hyderabad, the state\u2019s fire services director G.V. Narayana Rao told The Associated Press.",
      "Two other workers succumbed to burns and were pronounced dead in hospital, Rao said, adding that debris of the gutted pharmaceutical unit of Sigachi Industries was still being removed to find out if any more workers were trapped.",
      "Nearly three dozen injured workers were admitted to hospitals after Monday's blast, he said.",
      "\u201cThe whole structure of the factory has collapsed. Fire has been doused, and we hope to finish removing the debris in the next few hours,\u201d Rao said.",
      "Sigachi Industries did not disclose what led to the explosion and fire, but said the plant\u2019s core manufacturing infrastructure was damaged and facility operations would be halted for 90 days. The plant produces microcrystalline cellulose, a chemical compound commonly used in making drugs, the company said.",

      "Industrial accidents, particularly involving chemical reactors, aren\u2019t uncommon in such factories, underlining the need for authorities to implement stringent safety protocols and regulatory oversight in a sector critical to public health.",
      "Sigachi Industries Limited is an Indian company dealing with active pharmaceutical ingredients, intermediates and vitamin-mineral blends, according to the company\u2019s website. It has five manufacturing facilities across India and subsidiaries in the U.S and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Shares of Sigachi Industries tumbled 8% in intra-day trading Tuesday, extending the previous session\u2019s plunge of nearly 10%.",
      "In a disclosure to the Bombay Stock Exchange on Monday, the company called the incident \u201cunfortunate\u201d and announced that a thorough site assessment was underway. The factory where the fire occurred contributes a little more than a fourth of the company\u2019s annual capacity."
