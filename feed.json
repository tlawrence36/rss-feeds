      "Vice President Kamala Harris won't say how she voted on a ballot measure in her home state of California that would reverse criminal justice reforms approved in recent years",
      "DETROIT -- DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday declined to say how she voted on a key ballot measure in her home state of California that would reverse criminal justice reforms approved in recent years.",
      "Harris punted on a question about the ballot initiative in comments to reporters while campaigning in the battleground state of Michigan. She also confirmed, two days before Election Day, that she had \u201cjust filled out\u201d her mail-in ballot and it was \u201con its way to California.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am not going to talk about the vote on that. Because honestly it\u2019s the Sunday before the election and I don\u2019t intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,\" said Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and U.S. senator before she was elected vice president in 2020.",
      "The decision by the Democratic nominee for president not to publicly stake out a position on the high-profile initiative could leave her open to criticism from Republican Donald Trump that she is being soft on crime and from some left-leaning voters who would like to see her speak out forcefully against what they perceive as draconian anticrime efforts.",
      "The initiative, if passed, would make the crime of shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders and increase penalties for some drug charges, including those involving the synthetic opioid fentanyl. It also would give judges the authority to order people with multiple drug charges to get treatment.",
      "Proponents said the initiative is necessary to close loopholes in existing laws that have made it challenging for law enforcement to punish shoplifters and drug dealers.",
      "Opponents, including Democratic state leaders and social justice groups, said the proposal would disproportionately imprison poor people and those with substance use issues rather than target ringleaders who hire large groups of people to steal goods for them to resell online.",
      "California\u2019s approach to crime is a central issue in this election cycle.",
      "Beyond the ballot measure, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, a Democrat, is in a difficult reelection fight against challengers who say she has allowed the city to spiral out of control.",
      "The moderate Democratic mayor faces four main challengers on the Nov. 5 ballot, all fellow Democrats, who say Breed has squandered her six years in office. They say she allowed San Francisco to descend into chaos and blamed others for her inability to rein in homelessness and erratic street behavior, all while burglarized businesses pleaded for help.",
      "Meanwhile, Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price faces a recall election, and Los Angeles District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n is running against a rival who has criticized the incumbent\u2019s progressive approach to crime and punishment.",
      "Crime data shows the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles saw a steady increase in shoplifting between 2021 and 2022, according to a study by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.",
      "Across the state, shoplifting rates rose during the same time period but were still lower than the pre-pandemic levels in 2019, while commercial burglaries and robberies have become more prevalent in urban counties, the study says.",
      "Harris, in the final days of the 2024 campaign, has urging Americans in battleground states to make a voting plan to get themselves, friends and loved ones to the polls.",
      "But the vice president, and her campaign team, until her comments Sunday, had avoided speaking in detail about when she would cast her ballot and had sidestepped questions about how she would vote on the California measure.",
      "Last month, she suggested to reporters that she would disclose her position on the ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve not voted yet and I\u2019ve actually not read it yet,\u201d Harris told reporters at the end of an Oct. 16 campaign stop in Detroit. \u201cBut I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d",

      "On the final Sunday of a rollercoaster presidential contest, Republican nominee Donald Trump is asking voters in Pennsylvania again to make him leader of a \u201cfailed nation\u201d while also unleashing a profane, conspiracy-laden rant asserting U.S. elections ...",
      "LITITZ, Pa. -- LITITZ, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump gave a profane and conspiracy-laden speech two days before the presidential election, talking about reporters being shot and suggesting he \u201cshouldn't have left\u201d the White House after his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "In remarks Sunday that bore no resemblance to his standard speech in the campaign's closing stretch, the former president repeatedly cast doubt on the integrity of the vote and resurrected old grievances about being prosecuted after trying to overturn his defeat four years ago. Trump intensified his verbal attacks against a \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d national leadership and the American media, steering his Pennsylvania rally at one point on to the topic of violence against members of the press.",
      "The GOP nominee for the White House noted the ballistic glass placed in front of him at events after a gunman's assassination attempt in July at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and Trump talked about places where he saw openings in that protection.",
      "\u201cI have this piece of glass here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don\u2019t mind that so much.\u201d",
      "It was the second time in recent days that Trump has talked about guns being pointed at people he considers enemies after he suggested former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic, wouldn't be willing to support foreign wars if she had \u201cnine barrels shooting at her.\u201d",
      "His remarks also reflect that with less than 48 hours before Election Day, Trump continues to promote falsehoods about elections and argue that he can only lose to Democrat Kamala Harris if he is cheated, even though polls suggest a tight race.",
      "Some of his allies, notably former chief strategist Steve Bannon, have encouraged him to prematurely declare victory on Tuesday even if the race is too early to call. That's what Trump did four years ago, kicking off a process of fighting the election results that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "His campaign later sought to clarify his meaning in talking about the media.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the Media constantly talks and jokes about,\u201d campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. \u201cThe President\u2019s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else.\u201d",
      "Harris, meanwhile, told a Michigan church congregation on Sunday that God offers America a \u201cdivine plan strong enough to heal division,\u201d",
      "The two major candidates offered starkly different tones with the campaign almost at an end, as Harris said voters can reject \u201cchaos, fear and hate.\"",
      "She was concentrating on Michigan, beginning the day with a few hundred parishioners at Detroit\u2019s Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ. It marked the fourth consecutive Sunday that Harris, who is Baptist, has spoken to a Black congregation, a reflection of how critical Black voters are across multiple battleground states.",
      "\u201cI see faith in action in remarkable ways,\u201d she said in remarks that quoted the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah. \u201cI see a nation determined to turn the page on hate and division and chart a new way forward. As I travel, I see Americans from so-called red states and so-called blue states who are ready to bend the arc of history toward justice.\u201d",
      "She never mentioned Trump, though she\u2019s certain to return to her more conventional partisan speech in stops later Sunday. But Harris did tell her friendly audience that \u201cthere are those who seek to deepen division, sow hate, spread fear and cause chaos.\u201d The election and \u201cthis moment in our nation,\u201d she continued, \u201chas to be about so much more than partisan politics. It must be about the good work we can do together.\u201d",
      "Harris finished her remarks in about 11 minutes \u2014 starting and ending during Trump's roughly 90-minute speech at a chilly outdoor rally in Pennsylvania.",
      "Trump usually veers from subject to subject, a discursive style he has labeled \u201cthe weave.\u201d But outside the Lancaster airport, he went on long tangents and hardly mentioned his usual points on the economy, immigration and rote criticisms of Harris.",
      "Trump also referred to John Bolton, his former national security adviser and now a strident critic, as a \u201cdumb son of a b\u2014.\u201d And he repeated familiar and debunked theories about voter fraud, alleging that Democrats could only win by cheating. Public polls indicate a tight and competitive race across the battleground states that will determine the Electoral College outcome.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a crooked country,\" Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to make it straight. We\u2019re going to make it straight.\u201d",
      "Harris pushed back at Trump's characterizations of U.S. elections, telling reporters after the church service that Trump's comments are \u201cmeant to distract from the fact that we have and support free and fair elections in our country.\u201d Those \u201cgood systems\u201d were in place in 2020, Harris said, and \u201che lost.\u201d",
      "The vice president said she trusts the upcoming vote tally and urged voters, \u201cin particular people who have not yet voted to not fall for this tactic, which I think includes, suggesting to people that if they vote, their vote won't matter.\u201d",
      "Separately, the vice president tacitly acknowledged the significant population of Arab Americans in Michigan, and that community's voters who are angry at the Biden administration for its continuation of the U.S. alliance with Israel amid the Netanyahu government's war against Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\u201cI have been very clear that the level of death of innocent Palestinians is unconscionable,\u201d Harris told reporters Sunday after the church service. \u201cWe need to end the war, and we need to get the hostages out. And as president of the United States, I will do everything in my power to achieve that end.\u201d",
      "Trump, for his part, acknowledged that he was sidestepping his usual approach with his conspiratorial speech. He repeatedly mentioned how he disregarded the advice of his aides, telling their side of the story in a mocking voice and insisting that he had to talk about election fraud.",
      "Co-campaign manager Susie Wiles, long credited with bringing order to Trump's often-chaotic political operation, watched the former president silently from off stage.",
      "Trump at one point suggested that he wouldn\u2019t deliver this version of his speech again: \u201cI hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m only doing this one time.\u201d",

      "BOSTON -- Firefighters in Massachusetts are continuing to battle stubborn brush fires across the state with officials urging residents to take precautions to help avoid sparking new blazes.",
      "Hundreds of acres (hectares) in the greater Boston area have already burned in the past week with new fires cropping up in the western and central parts of the state.",
      "In Massachusetts, an average of 15 wildland fires are reported each October. This year, the month\u2019s total capped at about 200 \u2014 an increase of about 1,200% over the average, rivalling the monthly numbers usually seen in the traditional early spring brush fire season.",
      "About 100 fire were reported over the last seven days of the month and preliminary information indicates that all of them started with human activity, according to fire officials. The fires prompted some communities last week to cancel school classes and Halloween activities.",
      "On Friday, the National Weather Service declared a \u201cred flag\u201d warning for much of eastern Massachusetts. The warning means that the region, which has been experiencing dry and warm weather, is at high risk of fire.",
      "Fire officials have reminded residents that open burning is prohibited statewide through January and in many communities year-round.",
      "They also urged residents to avoid outdoor cooking and heating and to use caution when using power equipment like lawnmowers and leaf blowers. The engines can become hot enough to ignite dry leaves and grass.",
      "Fire officials also cautioned against tossing cigarette butts, matches, or other smoking materials over the edge of a balcony, stub them out on stairs or railings, or toss them in dry vegetation or debris.",
      "On Saturday, a Boston man was arrested in connection to a brush fire in Milford, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. The man was charged with setting fire to another\u2019s land and burning land, trees, lumber and produce.",
      "More than a quarter of this year's brush and wildland fires took place in October, according to Chief Fire Warden David Celino of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. The October fires have also accounted for more than half of the 1,158 acres (469 hectares) burned so far this year.",
      "\u201cThe weather conditions and dry surface fuels that have contributed to these fast-moving fires are expected to continue in the days ahead,\" Celino said in a press release. \"Any outdoor fire will grow quickly, become difficult to control, and require numerous firefighting resources.\u201d",
      "State Fire Marshal Jon Davine said about 45% of Massachusetts homes are in or near wooded areas at risk for brush and wildland fires. Many of those fires have started with activity around the house, like outdoor cooking and using lawn tractors and other power equipment, he added.",

      "North Carolina elections officials say that more than 4.2 million voters cast ballots at early in-person voting sites, with turnout in western counties hit by Hurricane Helene outpacing the rest of the state",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina had already surpassed its early-voting record set in 2020, but the State Board of Elections announced Sunday that more than 4.2 million voters cast ballots at early in-person voting sites, with turnout in western counties hit by Hurricane Helene outpacing the rest of the state.",
      "Early in-person voting, which ended Saturday, has become increasingly popular in the presidential battleground state over several election cycles. People can simultaneously register to vote and cast ballots at early voting sites.",
      "Four years ago, a record 3.63 million people voted at hundreds of sites in all 100 counties during the early-voting period. This year, the state exceeded that total by Thursday, days before the period ended, the board said.",
      "Including absentee voting, 4,465,548 voters \u2014 or 57% of the state\u2019s 7.8 million registered voters \u2014 cast ballots in the general election as of Sunday morning, officials said, noting that turnout may be slightly higher because of a lag between when ballots are cast and when data is uploaded.",
      "Turnout in the 25 western counties affected by Hurricane Helene was stronger than the rest of the state at 58.9% \u2014 about 2% higher than statewide turnout, officials said.",
      "\u201cI am proud of all of our 100 county boards of elections and the thousands of election workers who are making this happen in their communities,\u201d state board Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell said in a statement. \u201cAnd I am especially proud of the workers and voters of Western North Carolina. You are an inspiration to us all.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s strong early turnout has come partly in response to a push by state and national Republicans to get people to vote early. Their message marks a sharp contrast to the 2020 election, when former President Donald Trump \u2014 without any evidence to back the claim \u2014 said mail-in voting was rife with fraud.",
      "In addition to president, North Carolina residents are choosing a new governor, attorney general and several other statewide positions, along with members of the U.S. House and state General Assembly."

      "U.N. experts say Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militants and others",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militants and others, U.N. experts said in a new report.",
      "The Iranian-backed Houthis have exploited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and worked to enhance their status in Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d to gain popularity in the region and beyond, the experts monitoring sanctions against the Houthis said in the 537-page report to the U.N. Security Council.",
      "To support Iranian-backed Hamas militants, whose surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparked the war in Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, disrupting global shipping in a key geopolitical area.",
      "Despite Houthi claims that they would target ships linked to Israel, the panel said its investigations revealed the rebels have been targeting vessels indiscriminately.",
      "Its analysis of data from the International Maritime Organization, the U.S. and the United Kingdom revealed that at least 134 attacks were carried out from Houthi-controlled areas against merchant and commercial vessels and U.S. and U.K. warships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden between Nov. 15, 2023, and July 31, 2024.",
      "\u201cThe group\u2019s shift to actions at sea increased their influence in the region,\u201d the U.N. experts said. \u201cSuch a scale of attacks, using weapon systems on civilian vessels, had never occurred since the Second World War.\u201d",
      "In their attacks, the experts said, the Houthis used a new and previously undisclosed ballistic missile, the Hatem-2.",
      "The five-member U.N. panel includes experts on arms, finance, regional affairs, international humanitarian law and armed groups. The experts hail from India, Egypt, Switzerland, Belgium and Cabo Verde. Confidential sources told the panel that the Houthis are coordinating operations with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and strengthening ties to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group in Somalia.",
      "The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of the capital Sanaa and most of the north. Hopes for peace talks to end the war vanished after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks.",
      "The U.N. experts said the Yemen conflict, which started as an internal fight and expanded into a regional confrontation, \u201chas now escalated into a major international crisis.\u201d",
      "According to the experts, the number of Houthi fighters is estimated at 350,000 now, compared with 220,000 in 2022 and 30,000 in 2015.",
      "\u201cThe panel observes the transformation of the Houthis from a localized armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization, extending their operational capabilities well beyond the territories under their control,\u201d the report said.",
      "The experts said the transformation has been possible due to the transfer of military materiel and training provided by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard\u2019s elite Quds Force, Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists and technicians.",
      "Military experts, Yemeni officials and even officials close to the Houthis indicated that the rebel group couldn\u2019t produce complex weapons systems such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surveillance and attack drones, portable air defense systems, and thermal sights, which they have used without foreign support, the U.N. experts said.",
      "\u201cThe scale, nature and extent of transfers of diverse military materiel and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,\u201d the experts said.",
      "The panel said it observed similarities between multiple military items used by the Houthis and those produced and operated by Iran or its allies in the Axis of Resistance, which includes Hezbollah and Hamas and armed groups in Iraq and Syria.",
      "It said joint operations centers have been set up in Iraq and Lebanon with Houthi representatives \u201caimed at coordinating joint military actions of the Axis of Resistance.\u201d",
      "Inside Yemen, the panel said the Houthis have been intensifying military operations against the government. \u201cThe internal military situation is fragile, and any internal or external trigger could lead to the resumption of military confrontations,\u201d it said.",
      "The Houthis also have been recruiting large numbers of Yemeni youths and children as well as exploiting Ethiopian migrants, forcing them to join the fight against the government and engage in trafficking narcotics, it said.",
      "\u201cExploiting high illiteracy rates, particularly in tribal areas, they have reportedly mobilized boys as young as 10 or 11, often despite parental opposition,\u201d they said. \u201cRecruitment sermons and weekly classes on jihad are reportedly delivered in schools.\u201d",
      "Child recruitment reportedly increased after the war in Gaza started and the U.S. and U.K. airstrikes in Yemen, the experts said. Yemen\u2019s government said it received 3,298 reports of child recruitment in the first half of 2024, with youngsters reportedly used as human shields, spies and in combat \u2014 and for planting landmines and explosives, reconnaissance and as cooks."

      "WEBBERVILLE, Mich. -- A section of Interstate 96 in southeast Michigan remained closed Sunday after a semitruck crashed into more than a dozen vehicles overnight, killing 4 people and injuring 17 others, according to state police.",
      "Traffic on I-96 near Webberville had been temporarily stopped late Saturday as utility crews were completing work on power lines in the area. A semitruck with a trailer was heading westbound around 11:45 p.m. and crashed into the stalled vehicles.",
      "\u201cIt appears the driver of the semi-truck did not see the backup and could not stop his vehicle in time,\u201d Michigan State Police said in a statement on the social media platform X.",
      "The impact caused the semitruck and several vehicles to catch fire. Police said more than a dozen vehicles were involved in the crash.",
      "Police confirmed four deaths and said 17 people, including the driver of the truck, were injured and transported to nearby hospitals.",
      "Michigan State Police said Sunday that the victims were a 29-year-old man from Carson City who was driving a Ford pickup and three relatives from Lansing who were in a Chevy Trax. They were identified as a 20-year-old female, a 43-year-old female and a 47-year-old male. Police did not say how they were related.",
      "Authorities continued cleanup efforts Sunday and said I-96 near the site of the accident would \u201cbe closed for an indefinite period.\u201d"

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The president of Cyprus said Sunday his administration is committed to expanding defense and security cooperation with the U.S., as his meeting with American President Joe Biden last week charted a course for the \u201cnext ambitious steps\u201d in bilateral relations that are currently at a \u201chistoric high.\u201d",
      "President Nikos Christodoulides says his government's \u201cclear foreign policy orientation\u201d has resulted in deepening the Cyprus-U.S. strategic partnership over the first 18 months of his five-year term in fields including law enforcement cooperation on countering money laundering and sanctions evasion, as well as energy.",
      "A centerpiece of that security cooperation is the U.S.-funded center for port and maritime security known by its acronym CYCLOPS where officials from neighboring countries including Libya, Yemen and Lebanon, receive key training ranging from cybersecurity to ship inspections.",
      "Christodoulides said his Oct. 30 visit to the White House \u201cis proof and recognition of the geostrategic role of Cyprus and the country\u2019s potential and capabilities.\u201d",
      "\u201cCyprus can be a reliable \u2018port of stability\u2019 and at the same time a country that has a vision to transform its immediate region, alongside its partners, into a region of promise, stability, cooperation and prosperity,\" Christodoulides said in an email response to an Associated Press questionnaire.",
      "The Cypriot president said his administration is \u201ccertainly considering\u201d procuring U.S.-made weapons following the 2020 lifting of a decades-long arms embargo. But what must precede such purchases is for the U.S. Congress to lift its embargo for an extended period. Currently, that is renewed annually.",
      "Christodoulides said Cyprus\u2019 geostrategic role is highlighted by the fact that since Sept. 27, some 3,635 third-country nationals from 29 countries have been repatriated through the island nation following their evacuation from Lebanon. He said several countries consider Cyprus an \u201cassisted departure hub and a Temporary Safe Location (TSL)\u201d where the island\u2019s ports, airports and designated temporary accommodations are used for civilian or military-led departures. He did not specify those countries.",
      "He said Cyprus is ready to respond if and when a mass evacuation from Lebanon is set in motion.",
      "Another key initiative for which Cyprus has gained international plaudits and was singled out by Biden is the so-called Amalthea plan that saw the establishment of the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor through which some 20,000 metric tons of aid flowed into the Palestinian territory earlier this year.",
      "Most of that aid reached Gaza through a U.S.-built, $230 million temporary pier project that lasted about four months after being beset by turbulent weather, security threats and sweeping personnel restrictions.",
      "Christodoulides said work is underway in cooperation with the U.S. the U.K. the United Arab Emirates and the European Union, to re-activate the maritime route to Gaza through the Israeli port of Ashdod. Collected aid will be security-screened in Cyprus and shipped to Ashdod \u201cfor swift onward delivery to Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe maintain excellent, longstanding relations with our neighboring countries, underpinned by trust, and we have consistently acted as the region\u2019s voice in the European Union, and as a reliable interlocutor and partner with all the states of the region,\u201d Christodoulides said.",
      "On his decision to invite FBI and U.S. Department of Justice officials to help Cypriot law enforcement to halt Russian sanctions evasion through Cypriot lawyers and accountants, Christodoulides said, \u201cwe are strongly determined to clear our country\u2019s name internationally and prove that Cyprus is a state fully aligned with the principles and values of the West.\u201d",
      "He said \u201cseveral cases\u201d of possible sanctions evasion are under investigation\u201c and the aim is to bring them to justice as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Regarding energy cooperation, Christodoulides said the fact that both U.S. energy giants ExxonMobil and Chevron are active in the search for hydrocarbons in Cyprus\u2019 offshore economic zone is \u201ca vote of confidence\u201d in the island nation.",
      "He said next year will be a \u201cmilestone\u201d for both energy companies. ExxonMobil and partner QatarEnergy, which discovered a sizeable natural gas deposit in one of two areas, or blocks, they hold exploration licenses for, are scheduled to drill two additional wells in January of next year.",
      "Chevron is expected to complete fine-tuning a revised development plan for its Aphrodite gas field, estimated to hold around 4.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.",
      "\u201cAs the first gas from the Aphrodite is directed to the market, this automatically makes Cyprus a gas seller, which is extremely important not only in monetary terms but also for geopolitical reasons,\u201d said Christodoulides."

    "story": [
      "Senate Republicans vying to replace longtime leader Mitch McConnell have been crossing the country to campaign and fundraise for colleagues, making their final arguments before an important upcoming Senate vote",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans vying to replace longtime leader Mitch McConnell have been crossing the country to campaign and fundraise for colleagues, making their final arguments before a consequential ballot the week after the presidential election. But their pitches are mostly behind closed doors, and most GOP senators won\u2019t yet say which lawmaker they are backing.",
      "South Dakota's John Thune, McConnell\u2019s current No. 2, and John Cornyn of Texas, who held that job before Thune, are the front-runners in the Nov. 13 secret ballot to replace McConnell. The Kentucky senator is stepping aside from the post in January after almost two decades as leader. The winner could steer the direction of the party for years to come and possibly become the next Senate majority leader if Republicans win enough seats in Tuesday's election.",
      "The outcome is, for now, uncertain.",
      "Only a few Republican senators have publicly endorsed a candidate. Many say they are still undecided. The third senator in the race \u2014 Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who is dealing with his own reelection bid \u2014 could act as a spoiler. Another candidate could still jump in.",
      "In many ways, \u201cthe two Johns\u201d are remarkably similar, making the choice difficult for their colleagues. Both are well-liked and, in the mold of McConnell, lean toward the more traditional wing of the Republican Party. But both have also suggested they will try to move on from the McConnell era with a more open approach.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying to find differentiation because they\u2019re both great guys,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who has worked closely with both of them.",
      "The two men are also trying to distinguish themselves from McConnell by making clear that they support Donald Trump in this year\u2019s presidential election. Like McConnell, they have both sparred with Trump in the past, especially after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. But both Thune and Cornyn have talked to Trump frequently in recent months, attended campaign events and visited his Florida home.",
      "Whether Trump wins, and if he endorses one of the contenders, could become a determining factor.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do,\u201d Cornyn said of Trump in September. \u201cBut this is obviously an election between senators, and I think that\u2019s where the voters are.\u201d",
      "Some of the former president\u2019s strongest allies in the Senate are urging him to stay above the fray. Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who is supporting Thune, says he\u2019s been trying to talk Trump out of an endorsement. Trump understands \u201cthe need to work with whoever the next leader is,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "Tillis suggested that a Trump endorsement could backfire.",
      "\u201cYou have to be careful with the psychology of the Senate,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cWe know each other very well, and we spend hours and hours together. It\u2019s a fairly small club.\u201d",
      "Still, both Cornyn and Thune are keeping close to Trump. Cornyn met Trump on a trip to Texas in October and appeared at a rally in Nevada. Thune was at an event in August with Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance.",
      "Thune, who said after the Jan. 6 attack that Trump's efforts to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power were \u201cinexcusable,\" told The Associated Press over the summer that he views their potential relationship as a professional one. If they both win their elections, Thune said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d",
      "Scott, meanwhile, is a longtime friend of Trump\u2019s and has positioned himself as a strong ally. Scott traveled to New York to support Trump during Trump\u2019s hush money trial. Trump could endorse Scott in the contest, potentially winning more votes for the Florida senator or giving him leverage to influence the race.",
      "In addition to private meetings, both Thune and Cornyn have flown around the country to fundraise and campaign for their fellow senators.",
      "Thune has made more than two dozen campaign stops for GOP senate candidates, and aides say he has raised more than $31 million for Senate races this campaign cycle, including a $4 million transfer to the Senate Republican campaign operation.",
      "Cornyn has similarly gone around for candidates and poured money into Texas races. His aides emphasize his long history of fundraising for Republicans \u2014 more than $400 million during his 22 years in the Senate, his office says.",
      "On policy, the two men are similar, voting generally in step with the conference but working with Democrats at times. Cornyn is a longtime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who took a leading role on bipartisan gun legislation two years ago. Thune worked across the aisle as a former chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.",
      "It's unclear whether either could win support from the growing minority of Republican senators who battled McConnell in recent years as he championed Ukraine aid and criticized Trump. Many in that group voted for Scott when he challenged McConnell after the 2022 elections.",
      "In a potential overture to that group, Cornyn has called for a conference vote on instituting term limits for the Republican leader. \u201cI believe the Senate needs more engagement from my colleagues, and that includes the opportunity for any member to serve in leadership,\u201d Cornyn posted on X in March.",
      "Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a member of the more conservative faction, said he has not made a commitment in the race but wants to know how they would move legislation and work with Trump if he is president. \u201cI think some of this will come into focus after the election when we know what we\u2019re dealing with, we know what our caucus is going to be,\u201d Hawley said.",
      "Many in that group, including Scott and Utah Sen. Mike Lee, have pushed to take power away from leadership and empower individual senators. Lee has issued a series of candidate demands, but neither Cornyn nor Thune has so far shown interest in negotiating.",
      "But both of them have signaled that they hear the complaints.",
      "Thune indicated in the AP interview that he's open to making changes to the leader\u2019s role, but cautioned that he would not leave the position at the mercy of rank-and-file senators. He said he wanted to \u201cempower our individual members or committees to do things through regular order\u201d and open up the amendment process, but \u201cI\u2019m not going to make wholesale changes that weaken the leader position to where it\u2019s just a free-for-all.\"",
      "Tillis suggested in September that it would be a deal breaker for him if any of the candidates engaged in deal-making.",
      "\u201cIf you would be willing to weaken your position to satisfy a few votes, then you\u2019re unfit to be leader, in my opinion,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cAnd I think most people think that way.\u201d",

Among numerous injuries, 11 people required hospitalization, authorities said.",
      "Much of the damage occurred in and around the state capital, Oklahoma City, near the state's center, although there were reports of damage at various points around the state and early morning storms set off tornado warnings that extended south to the Arkansas state line. Heavy rains caused flash flooding in some areas and one lightning-sparked house fire was reported.",

Lyle and Erik Menendez were sentenced to life in prison and lost all subsequent appeals. But today, more than three decades later, they unexpectedly have a chance of getting out.",
      "Not because of the workings of the legal system. Because of entertainment.",
      "After two recent documentaries and a scripted drama on the pair brought new attention to the 35-year-old case, the Los Angeles district attorney has recommended they be resentenced.",
      "The popularity and proliferation of true crime entertainment like Netflix\u2019s docudrama \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story\u201d is effecting real life changes for their subjects and in society more broadly.

The fascination with the genre may be considered morbid by some, but it can be partially explained by the human desire to make sense of the world through stories.",
      "In the case of the Menendez brothers, Lyle, who was then 21, and Erik, then 18, have said they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent the disclosure of the father\u2019s long-term sexual molestation of Erik. But at their trial, many of the sex abuse allegations were not allowed to be presented to the jury, and prosecutors contended they committed murder simply to get at their parents\u2019 money.",

      "Much true crime of the past takes particularly shocking crimes and explores them in depth, generally with the assumption that those convicted of the crime were actually guilty and deserved to be punished.",
      "The success of the podcast \u201c Serial,\u201d which cast doubt on the murder conviction of Adnan Syed, has given birth to a newer genre that often assumes (and intends to prove) the opposite. The protagonists are innocent, or \u2014 as in the case of the Menendez brothers \u2014 guilty but sympathetic, and thus not deserving of their harsh sentences.",
      "\u201cThere is an old tradition of journalists picking apart criminal cases and showing that people are potentially innocent,\u201d says Maurice Chammah, a staff writer at The Marshall Project and author of \u201cLet the Lord Sort Them: The Rise and Fall of the Death Penalty.\"",
      "\u201cBut I think that the curve kind of goes up exponentially in the wake of \u2018Serial,\u2019 which was 2014 and obviously changed the entire landscape economically and culturally of podcasts,\" Chammah says. \"And then you have \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 come along a few years later and become a kind of behemoth example of that in docuseries.\u201d",
      "Roughly during the same time period, the innocence movement gained traction along with the Black Lives Matter movement and greater attention on police custody deaths. And in popular culture, both fiction and nonfiction, the trend is to mine a villainous character's backstory.",
      "\u201cAll these superheroes, supervillains, the movie \u2018Joker' \u2014 you\u2019re just inundated with this idea that people\u2019s bad behavior is shaped by trauma when they were younger,\u201d Chammah said.",
      "Banner often represents some of the least sympathetic defendants imaginable, including those accused of child sexual abuse. He says the effects of these cultural trends are real. Juries today are more likely to give his clients the benefit of the doubt and are more skeptical of police and prosecutors. But he also worries about the intense focus in current true crime on cases where things went wrong, which he says are the outliers.",
      "While the puzzle aspect of \u201cDid they get it right?\u201d might feed our curiosity, he says, we run the risk of sowing distrust in the entire criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to take away the positive ramifications that putting that spotlight on a case can bring. But you also don\u2019t want to give off the impression that this is how our justice system works. That if we can get enough cameras and microphones on a case, then that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to save somebody off of death row or that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to get a life sentence overturned.\u201d",
      "Adds Chammah: \"If you open up sentencing decisions and second looks and criminal justice policy to pop culture \u2014 in the sense of who gets a podcast made about them, who gets Kim Kardashian talking about them \u2014 the risk of extreme arbitrariness is really great. ... It feels like it\u2019s only a matter of time before the wealthy family of some defendant basically funds a podcast that tries to make a viral case for their innocence.\u201d",
      "Whitney Phillips, who teaches a class on true crime and media ethics at the University of Oregon, says the popularity of the genre on social media adds another layer of complications, often encouraging active participation of viewer and listeners.",
      "\u201cBecause these are not trained detectives or people who have any actual subject area expertise in forensics or even criminal law, then there\u2019s this really common outcome of the wrong people being implicated or floated as suspects,\" she says. \"Also, the victims' families now are part of the discourse. They might be accused of this, that, or the other, or at the very least, you have your loved one's murder, violent death, being entertainment for millions of strangers.\u201d",
      "This sensibility has been both chronicled and lampooned in the streaming comedy-drama series \u201cOnly Murders in the Building,\u201d which follows three unlikely collaborators who live in a New York apartment building where a murder has taken place. The trio decide to make a true crime podcast while simultaneously trying to solve the case.",
      "Nothing about true crime is fundamentally unethical, Phillips says. \u201cIt\u2019s that the social media system \u2014 the attention economy \u2014 is not calibrated for ethics. It\u2019s calibrated for views, it\u2019s calibrated for engagement and it\u2019s calibrated for sensationalism.\"",
      "Many influencers are now vying for the \u201cmurder audience,\u201d Phillips says, with social media and more traditional media feeding off each other. True crime is now creeping into lifestyle content and even makeup tutorials.",
      "\u201cIt was sort of inevitable that you would see the collision of these two things and having these influencers literally just put on a face of makeup and then tell a very kind of \u2014 it\u2019s very informal, it\u2019s very dishy, it\u2019s often not particularly well researched,\" she says. \u201cThis is not investigative journalism.\u201d"

      "Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d"

      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- The winner of Arkansas' race for state Supreme Court chief justice won't change its conservative majority and it hasn't drawn the heavy spending of Republican groups that have targeted past campaigns. But the outcome still will make history.",
      "Justices Karen Baker and Rhonda Wood are running to replace outgoing Chief Justice Dan Kemp in this year's nonpartisan runoff. Baker and Wood were the top two finishers in a four-person race for the court in March, but neither garnered the majority necessary to win the race outright.",
      "Arkansas' court is technically nonpartisan, but Republican-backed justices hold a 4-3 majority on the court. That majority is set to expand to 5-2, no matter who wins the race, with GOP Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders slated to fill two vacancies on the court next year.",
      "Baker or Wood will become the first woman elected chief justice in the state. Betty Dickey was appointed to serve as the court's chief justice in 2003.",
      "Wood, who was first elected to the court in 2014 and then reelected in 2022, has the backing of Republicans including Sanders and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton. The Republican Party of Arkansas' state committee also has endorsed her candidacy.",
      "Wood, however, said she believes her experience on the court shows she is an independent voice and not ruling in line with either party.",
      "\u201cI think I have made decisions consistently with the law, but not necessarily maybe one party or another would agree with,\" Wood told The Associated Press.",
      "Baker, who has served on the court since 2011, did not respond to multiple messages from the AP requesting an interview. Baker won reelection in 2022, defeating a former Republican lawmaker who touted himself as a constitutional conservative.",
      "In interviews, Baker has said she has proven herself to be nonpartisan.",
      "\u201cI think my opponent has demonstrated she is not,\u201d she told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, when asked about Sanders' political action committee supporting Wood's campaign.",
      "Arkansas' court races have been targeted in past years by conservative groups that have spent heavily on efforts to push the court further to the right. Those groups, however, haven't identified Arkansas as a target this year but are instead focusing on higher profile races in battleground states like Ohio and Michigan.",
      "The two candidates split most recently on a lawsuit over an abortion rights measure that would have scaled back a state ban that took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned.",
      "Wood wrote the court\u2019s 4-3 majority opinion that upheld the state\u2019s decision to reject petitions submitted in favor of the proposal. The court ruled sponsors of the measure did not comply with paperwork requirements for paid signature gatherers.",
      "In a blistering dissent, Baker asked, \u201cWhy are the respondent and the majority determined to keep this particular vote from the people?\u201d",
      "When asked what the opinions clarified about the difference between the justices, Wood said, \u201cI think it's clear which comes across as more judicially restrained versus an opinion that's sort of trying to sway public emotion.\"",
      "Baker has touted her experience on the bench and previously cited improving attorney licensure as an area she would like to focus on if elected.",
      "Wood has said she would like to push for changes to the court system to make it more accessible, including text notifications of hearings and alternative options for court attendance including nights courts and virtual courts.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot of finite kind of pinpoint things I want to do specifically but the theme is making it way more transparent and citizen-friendly,\u201d Wood said.",
      "Whoever loses the race will still remain on the court, but the election will give Sanders a second appointment to make next year. Justice Courtney Hudson was elected in March to a position on her court that is different from her own, creating a vacancy. Hudson will replace Cody Hiland, who Sanders appointed to the court last year."

They knew his mental health was fragile after more than one suicide attempt. But the best officers could do in a state with some of the most expansive gun rights is suggest Harris keep the weapon in a storage unit.",
      "Nine days later, Harris entered his former St. Louis high school and declared, \u201cAll of you are going to die.\u201d",
      "A new 456-page police report details the efforts Harris' family took to try to take his gun away in the days before he walked into Central Visual Arts and Performing Arts High School on Oct. 24, 2022, when he killed a student and a teacher and wounded seven others before he was fatally shot by police.",
      "Missouri is not among the 21 states with a red-flag law. Also known as extreme risk protection orders, red-flag laws are intended to restrict the purchase of guns or temporarily remove them from people who may hurt themselves or someone else.",
      "The case highlights how hard it is for law enforcement to restrict gun access, even when there are clues something is deeply amiss.",
      "After an Army reservist killed 18 people in October 2023 in Lewiston, Maine, an investigation found missed opportunities to intervene in the shooter\u2019s psychiatric crisis. And before a 14-year-old was charged in a deadly shooting this fall at his Georgia high school, a deputy talked to him about an online threat and family warned of an \u201cextreme emergency.\u201d",
      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college. Pandemic disruptions, the arrest of a friend in a homicide and a car wreck all may have contributed to his depression, his family and former boss told investigators.",
      "The police report makes no mention of him attending college. Instead, he worked in the cafeteria at a senior facility, where he sometimes discussed guns with coworkers.",
      "The following August he met with a Washington University psychiatry resident, telling her he thought about shooting people at his old school. He said those thoughts lasted for just one evening and went away, and that there was no planning and he didn\u2019t want to do it.",
      "But soon after, Harris began a countdown to the shooting. His plans included detailed maps of the school and a plan to target teachers, students and the LGBTQ community. He also had plans to burn down his family's home with them inside.",
      "The psychiatrist prescribed medications, but Harris didn\u2019t fill the prescriptions. The report says they developed an emergency plan.",
      "Washington University did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Harris then stopped showing up for appointments.",
      "On Oct. 8, he tried to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer in St. Charles, Missouri, but the transaction was blocked by an FBI background check. The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school.

      "The trial of a man accused of killing two teenage girls in a small Indiana community has passed its midway point following more than two weeks of testimony about the 2017 killings",
      "DELPHI, Ind. -- The trial of a man accused of killing two teenage girls in a small Indiana community has passed its midway point following more than two weeks of testimony about the 2017 killings.",
      "Prosecutors rested their case Thursday against Richard Allen after jurors heard recorded phone calls in which he told his wife that he killed Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14.",
      "Allen's trial began Oct. 18 at the Carroll County Courthouse in Delphi, the girls\u2019 hometown. Jurors have been sequestered since the begining of the trial, which is scheduled to run through Nov. 15.",
      "The defense began calling its first witnesses Thursday. A psychologist for the Indiana Department of Correction told jurors Friday that Allen was seriously mentally ill when he began confessing to the killings while housed at the Westville Correctional Facility.",
      "Allen, 52, faces up to 130 years in prison if he is convicted on two counts of murder and two additional counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping.",
      "Here are some key moments in the trial so far:",
      "Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland opened the trial by telling jurors they would see and hear evidence, including incriminating statements Allen has made, that will convince them he forced the girls off a hiking trail into a secluded area while armed with a gun and cut their throats.",
      "Allen was the person seen on cellphone video German recorded on the day the girls disappeared and an unspent bullet found between their bodies came from Allen's gun, McLeland said.",
      "Defense attorney Andrew Baldwin told jurors Allen is innocent. Baldwin said the jury would hear witness statements and forensic evidence that would raise \u201creasonable doubt\u201d that Allen is not the killer and said the state's timeline does not match the evidence in the case.",
      "Someone else may have kidnapped the teens and returned them early the next day to the scene where they were found dead, Baldwin said.",
      "In the first full week of the trial, jurors were shown photographs of the area where the teens' bodies were found in a wooded area off the hiking trail. The girls, known as Abby and Libby, had crossed an abandoned railroad trestle called the Monon High Bridge during their hike.",
      "Some jurors and others in the courtroom gasped or turned away when gruesome images of their bloody bodies were shown, and the girls' mothers wept.",
      "Jurors also viewed cellphone video that German recorded just before the youths vanished showing a man wearing a blue jacket and jeans following Williams as she crosses the Monon High Bridge.",
      "In an enhanced version of the video shown to jurors, one of the girls says, \u201cThere\u2019s no path so we have to go down here.\u201d Just before the video ends, prosecutors said, the man seen in the video tells the teens, \u201c Down the hill.\u201d",
      "Investigators said in an affidavit released about a month after Allen's October 2022 arrest that he became a suspect after they went back and reviewed \u201cprior tips\u201d and found that he had been interviewed by an officer in 2017.",
      "Trial testimony has revealed more details about how they zeroed in on the former pharmacy worker.",
      "A retired state government worker who volunteered in March 2017 to help police with the investigation told jurors that in September 2022 she found paperwork that caught her eye.",
      "Kathy Shank testified she found a \u201clead sheet\u201d saying that two days after German and Williams\u2019 bodies were found, a man contacted authorities and said he had been on the trail the afternoon the girls went missing. His name was listed incorrectly as Richard Allen Whiteman and marked \u201ccleared,\u201d Shank said.",
      "She determined the man\u2019s name was actually Richard Allen and recalled that a young girl had been on the trail at the same location and time and had seen a man.",
      "\u201cI thought there could be a correlation,\u201d Shank testified, adding that she notified officers of her find.",
      "The girls' bodies were found Feb. 14, 2017, the day after they went missing.",
      "Two days later, Allen contacted authorities and told them he was on the hiking trail the afternoon of Feb. 13, during the time period when the girls disappeared, according to testimony.",
      "Dan Dulin, an Indiana Department of Natural Resources captain, told the court he spoke to Allen, who said he was on the hiking trail between 1 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. and remembered seeing three girls.",
      "After Shank brought Allen to investigators\u2019 attention, they interviewed him in October 2022. Allen told investigators he arrived at the trail around noon and left no later than 2 p.m., not 3:30 p.m. as he told Dulin in 2017.",
      "Steve Mullin, who was Delphi's police chief when the girls were killed and later became an investigator at the county prosecutor\u2019s office, said Allen told him and another officer that he was wearing a blue or black Carhartt jacket, jeans and a beanie on the day the teens vanished.",
      "Mullin said he asked Allen if he was the similarly dressed person seen in German\u2019s cellphone video.",
      "\u201cHis response was if the picture was taken with the girls\u2019 camera, there was no way it was him,\u201d Mullin testified.",
      "Prosecutors also showed jurors police interviews with Allen videotaped before his arrest in which he repeatedly professed his innocence.",

    "summary": "No one knows how Tuesday&rsquo;s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
    "story": [
      "No one knows how Tuesday\u2019s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve\u2019s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- No one knows how Tuesday's presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve's move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year.",
      "The presidential contest might still be unresolved when the Fed ends its two-day meeting Thursday afternoon, yet that uncertainty would have no effect on its decision to further reduce its benchmark rate. The Fed's future actions, though, will become more unsettled once a new president and Congress take office in January, particularly if Donald Trump were to win the White House again.",
      "Trump's proposals to impose high tariffs on all imports and launch mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants and his threat to intrude on the Fed's normally independent rate decisions could send inflation surging, economists have said. Higher inflation would, in turn, compel the Fed to slow or stop its rate cuts.",
      "On Thursday, the Fed's policymakers, led by Chair Jerome Powell, are on track to cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to about 4.6%, after having implemented a half-point reduction in September. Economists expect another quarter-point rate cut in December and possibly additional such moves next year. Over time, rate cuts tend to lower the costs of borrowing for consumers and businesses.",
      "The Fed is reducing its rate for a different reason than it usually does: It often cuts rates to boost a sluggish economy and a weak job market by encouraging more borrowing and spending. But the economy is growing briskly, and the unemployment rate is a low 4.1%, the government reported Friday, even with hurricanes and a strike at Boeing having sharply depressed net job growth last month.",
      "Instead, the central bank is lowering rates as part of what Powell has called \u201ca recalibration\u201d to a lower-inflation environment. When inflation spiked to a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed proceeded to raise rates 11 times \u2014 ultimately sending its key rate to about 5.3%, also the highest in four decades.",
      "But in September, year-over-year inflation dropped to 2.4%, barely above the Fed's 2% target and equal to its level in 2018. With inflation having fallen so far, Powell and other Fed officials have said they think high borrowing rates are no longer necessary. High borrowing rates typically restrict growth, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing and auto sales.",
      "\u201cThe restriction was in place because inflation was elevated,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. \u201cInflation is no longer elevated. The reason for the restriction is gone.\u201d",
      "Fed officials have suggested that their rate cuts would be gradual. But nearly all of them have expressed support for some further reductions.",
      "\u201cFor me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the (Fed's key) rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level,\u201d Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Directors, said in a speech last month.",
      "Jonathan Pingle, an economist at Swiss bank UBS, said that Waller's phrasing reflected \u201cunusual confidence and conviction that rates were headed lower.\"",
      "Next year, the Fed will likely start to wrestle with the question of just how low their benchmark rate should go. Eventually, they may want to set it at a level that neither restricts nor stimulates growth \u2014 \u201cneutral\u201d in Fed parlance.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials acknowledge that they don't know exactly where the neutral rate is. In September, the Fed's rate-setting committee estimated that it was 2.9%. Most economists think it's closer to 3% to 3.5%.",
      "The Fed chair said the officials have to assess where neutral is by how the economy responds to rate cuts. For now, most officials are confident that at 4.9%, the Fed's current rate is far above neutral.",
      "Some economists argue, though, that with the economy looking healthy even with high borrowing rates, the Fed doesn't need to ease credit much, if at all. The idea is that they may already be close to the level of interest rates that neither slows nor stimulates the economy.",
      "\u201cIf the unemployment rate stays in the low 4's and the economy is still going to grow at 3%, does it matter that the (Fed's) rate is 4.75% to 5%?\u201d said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, asked. \u201cWhy are they cutting now?\u201d",
      "With the Fed's latest meeting coming right after Election Day, Powell will likely field questions at his news conference Thursday about the outcome of the presidential race and how it might affect the economy and inflation. He can be expected to reiterate that the Fed's decisions aren't affected by politics at all.",
      "During Trump's presidency, he imposed tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, steel and a range of goods from China, which President Joe Biden maintained. Though studies show that washing machine prices rose as a result, overall inflation did not rise much.",
      "But Trump is now proposing significantly broader tariffs \u2014 essentially, import taxes \u2014 that would raise the prices of about 10 times as many goods from overseas.",
      "Many mainstream economists are alarmed by Trump\u2019s latest proposed tariffs, which they say would almost certainly reignite inflation. A report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that Trump\u2019s main tariff proposals would make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been.",
      "The Fed could be more likely to raise rates in response to tariffs this time, according to economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"given that Trump is threatening much bigger increases in tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cAccordingly,\" they wrote, \u201cwe will scale back the reduction in the funds rate in our 2025 forecasts if Trump wins.\u201d",

      "Commentators and politicians had warned that a Stoianoglu victory could radically change the political landscape in the Danube and Black Sea region, not because he was some kind of \"Trojan horse\", but rather because Russia has thrown its weight behind him.",
      "There were queues at polling stations in Moscow, Italy and among voters from a mainly Russian-speaking breakaway region of Transnistria, who had to cross the River Dniester into Moldovan-controlled territory to vote. Transnistria is home to a Russian military base and a huge arms depot.",

      "Although Sandu had easily won the first round of the vote, several candidates swung behind Stoianoglo, although the third-placed candidate refused to back either of the two.",
      "The first round coincided with a nail-biting referendum on backing a change to the constitution embracing the commitment to join the EU.",
      "In the end the vote passed by a tiny margin in favour, and Maia Sandu said there had been clear evidence of attempts to buy 300,000 votes."

      "The second phase of the vaccine rollout began on Saturday after being postponed in October due to intense Israeli bombardments, mass displacement and lack of access in the region.",

      "The WHO had aimed to give 119,000 children in the area a second dose of the oral polio vaccine.",
      "The agency added that achieving this target \"is now unlikely due to access constraints\".",

      "However, the area agreed in the latest humanitarian pause \"has been substantially reduced\" compared to the first round of vaccinations and is now limited to just Gaza City, according to the WHO.",
      "From the start of the polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, medical experts stressed that delays in administering the second dose could jeopardise overall efforts to halt transmission of the contagious, potentially deadly disease.",

      "As for Berhane, a humanitarian organisation has been able to provide him with a prosthetic leg and crutch, which has helped him walk again.",
      "He was not able to move back to Seyabo, as life there often involves taking strenuous hikes through the mountains.",
      "A usual 20-minute journey by foot to the village school would now take around an hour - so he has moved to Adwa, where he has rented a house with his sister.",
      "They are unclear how they will cover all their costs as his sister is still dependent on aid, but Berhane says this is the best way for him to continue at school.",

      "That might be overly optimistic. Like the sliver of sandwiched Chinese territory she has travelled to see, Beijing too is caught between its sanctioned neighbours.",
      "Fears over the budding alliance between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un have peaked in recent weeks, with reports of North Korea deploying thousands of troops to support Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "And that was before Pyongyang fired a banned intercontinental missile on Thursday, on the longest flight recorded yet \u2013 after turning up the rhetoric against Seoul for weeks.",
      "\u201cChina seeks a relationship with a reasonable, high level of control over North Korea,\u201d says Christopher Green, an analyst from the International Crisis Group. \u201cAnd North Korea\u2019s relationship with Russia threatens to undermine that.\u201d",
      "If Chinese leader Xi Jinping is unable shape the Putin-Kim alliance to suit his interests, China may well remain stuck in the middle as western anger and anxiety grows.",
      "Moscow and Pyongyang deny that North Korean soldiers are headed for Ukraine, widely seen as a significant escalation. But the United States says it has seen evidence of this, following allegations by South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence.",
      "The first reports emerged just before Xi met his Russian counterpart at the Brics summit earlier in October, overshadowing a gathering that was meant to send the West a defiant message.",
      "It increasingly appears as though China\u2019s allies are spiralling out of its control. Beijing, the senior partner in the triad, seeks to be the stable leader of a new world order, one that is not led by the US. But that\u2019s difficult to do when one ally has started a war in Europe, and another is accused of aiding the invasion.",
      "\u201cChina is unhappy with the way things are going,\u201d Mr Green says, \u201cbut they are trying to keep their discontent relatively quiet.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s certainly a sensitive topic for Beijing, judging by the response to our presence in the border town, where it seems tourists are welcome - but journalists are not.",
      "We were in public areas at all times, and yet the team was stopped, repeatedly questioned, followed and our footage deleted.",
      "The hotel demanded to keep my passport for \u201cmy safety and the safety of others\u201d. Police visited our hotel rooms, and they also blocked the road to the port at Hunchun, which would have given us a closer view of the current trade between Russia and China.",
      "'Lips and teeth'",
      "On the viewing platform in Fangchuan, it\u2019s clear that most tourists have come to see North Korea.",
      "\u201cI saw a person cycling,\u201d says one girl peering through a telescope. Her friend  rushes over to see: \u201cOoooh! It\u2019s such a mysterious country.\u201d",
      "Close by is the Tumen river that gently cuts through all three countries. It is China\u2019s gateway into the Sea of Japan, where it has territorial disputes with Tokyo.",
      "The 1,400km-long (870 mile) Chinese border has some of the only platforms with a clear view into North Korea. South Korea\u2019s frontier with the North is an almost impenetrable barrier, the heavily mined and fortified Demilitarized Zone.",
      "Someone offers me a pair of binoculars. Some people are cycling through the village on ageing bicycles, but there are few other signs of life. One of the largest buildings is a school with a sign calling for children to \u201clearn well for Chosun\u201d, another name for North Korea.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea has always been our neighbour. It\u2019s no stranger to us,\u201d says a middle-aged man. \u201cTo be able to see how they live makes me realise China is prosperous and strong.\u201d",
      "Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime would certainly struggle to survive without its biggest benefactor, China, which accounts for more than 90% of foreign trade, including food and fuel.",
      "That was not always the case. In the early 1960s it was the Chinese who fled famine across the Tumen river. Some even went to school in North Korea because they believed its education system at the time was better.",
      "The North Korean economy crashed after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 \u2013 which had been its main source of aid and cheap oil - sparking severe food shortages and, eventually, famine.",
      "Soon, North Korean refugees began wading through an often freezing river at the risk of being shot dead to escape hunger, poverty and repression. There are now more than 30,000 of them in South Korea and an unknown number still live in China.",
      "\u201cSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea hasn\u2019t really had any choice but to maintain good relations with China, which has been its sole benefactor,\u201d Mr Green says.",
      "But now, he adds, Russia \u201cis offering an alternative and the North Koreans are seeking to exploit that\u201d.",
      "Mao Zedong, the first leader of the People\u2019s Republic of China, had likened the relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang to the closeness between \u201clips and teeth\u201d: \u201cIf the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold.\u201d",

      "Now, Beijing finds itself smarting from a lack of gratitude as Kim\u2019s lips are \u201ckissing elsewhere\u201d, according to sociologist Aidan Foster-Carter, who has studied North Korea for several decades.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea has consistently been the comrade from hell to both Russia and China. They take as much money as they can and [then] do what they like.\u201d",
      "Analysts have noted that Kim has consistently flattered Putin over Xi in the last year. While Kim hasn\u2019t met Xi since 2019, he has met Putin twice in the past year or so. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has drawn the two sanctioned leaders closer than ever. Putin seeks more support for his war and Kim wants to bolster his regime with alliances and attention.",
      "From the Chinese border, it\u2019s easy to see the burgeoning relationship between the two sides.",
      "The whistle of a train interrupts the tourist chatter, and a steam engine pulling a long line of freight carriages slowly chugs across the railway bridge from Russia to North Korea. It stops in front of a Korean sign facing China which reads: \u201cTowards a new victory!\u201d",
      "The US estimates that Kim has sold more than a million artillery shells and Grad rockets to Moscow for use in Ukraine, which North Korea denies.",
      "But there is no doubt that the pair have stepped up cooperation after signing a security pact in June to help each other in the event of \"aggression\" against either country.",
      "\u201cYou have very stiff and formal language to Xi Jinping on the occasion of what is actually an historically important event \u2013 the 75th anniversary of relations of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d Mr Foster-Carter says.",
      "\u201cAnd yet on Putin\u2019s birthday, Kim calls him \u2018my closest comrade\u2019. If you are Xi Jinping, what are you thinking?\u201d",
      "'Through gritted teeth'",
      "It\u2019s hard to know, because China has shown no signs of interfering with the Russia-North Korea alliance.",
      "The US has noticed Beijing\u2019s disquiet and for once the two rivals may have similar goals.",
      "In the last week, State Department officials have raised the issue of North Korean troops in Russia with Chinese diplomats.",
      "Beijing does have options - in the past, they have cut supplies of oil and coal to North Korea, and complied with US-led sanctions to curb Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme.",
      "Already, China is battling US accusations that it is selling components to Russia that aid its invasion of Ukraine. Beijing\u2019s trade with Moscow is also flourishing, even as it tries to cope with Western tariffs.",
      "Xi has kept Russia close because he needs Putin\u2019s help to challenge the US-led world order. But he has not stopped trying to repair ties with Europe, the UK and even the US. China has also been holding talks with Japan and South Korea to ease historic tensions.",
      "But Kim\u2019s increasingly aggressive rhetoric against Seoul has the South once again debating whether it should have its own nuclear arsenal. North Korean troops on a Ukrainian battlefield would only further unravel Beijing\u2019s plans.",
      "The possibility has already seen South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol discuss \"concrete counter-measures\" and talk of strengthening security cooperation with Ukraine and Nato.",
      "A nuclear-armed South Korea or an \u201cEast Asian Nato\u201d are not ideal in a region where China wants greater sway. An emboldened Kim could also draw a stronger show of support from the US \u2013 in the form of warships or even weapons - towards its allies, Seoul and Tokyo.",
      "\u201cFor a very long time, China has had a policy of three nos in Northeast Asia \u2013 one of those nos was a no nuclear North Korea. Obviously that has been a failure,\u201d Mr Green says.",
      "Now Beijing fears that the alliance with Russia could destabilise North Korea, he adds: \u201cThat could even benefit Vladimir Putin in a way it really would not benefit Xi Jinping.\u201d",
      "Experts say Beijing is just as worried as the West about what military technology Putin might sell to Kim in exchange for troops.",
      "\u201cSatellites, for sure,\u201d Mr Foster-Carter says. \u201cBut Putin is bad \u2013 not mad. Russia knows just as China knows that North Korea is a loose cannon. Giving [Kim] more technology for nukes is not a good thing for anybody.\u201d",
      "Experts believe Xi is unlikely to do anything drastic because China needs a stable North Korea \u2013 if he cuts off aid, he would likely have a refugee crisis at the border.",
      "But Kim too might have a decision to make.",
      "Although Russia is paying for shells and troops, Mr Foster-Carter says, it is China that \"has actually kept North Korea going all this time, often through gritted teeth. I just wonder at what point Beijing will turn on Pyongyang?\u201d.",
      "Kim's deadly gamble could also have a profound impact closer to home - the 25 million North Koreans who are cut off from the outside world and completely dependent on the regime for their survival.",
      "Across the Tumen river in Fangchuan, a North Korean soldier watches us, while we watch him.",
      "Steam rises from snack stands selling noodles and sizzled octopus on sticks on the Chinese side. And he can probably hear the giggling tourists taking pictures with the latest cameras and phones, which he is forbidden from owning.",
      "The shallow river is a gulf neither the tourists nor the soldier can cross.",
      "Are North Korean troops joining Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine?",

      "A day before, President Joe Biden had dropped out of the election race and endorsed her to succeed him as Democratic candidate. With only a short period of campaigning ahead of her, Harris had no time to waste.",
      "There is a saying in politics: define yourself or be defined by your opponent. And in that moment, when Harris made her first pitch to the American people, she defined herself not just in terms of her record in the White House or as a US senator, but the years she spent as a California prosecutor.",
      "\u201cI took on perpetrators of all kinds - predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type,\u201d she said of her Republican challenger.",
      "The line has been repeated often at her campaign rallies and stump speeches, as the 60-year-old has sought to frame this election as a contest between a hard-bitten prosecutor and a convicted felon, constantly reminding voters of Trump\u2019s legal troubles.",
      "How Donald Trump came back from the political abyss",
      "How Donald Trump came back from the political abyss",
      "But a look back at Harris\u2019s time in and out of California's courtrooms reveals her enduring struggle to define herself, what her opponents say is a history of pivoting on issues depending on the political weather, as well as her uncanny ability to seize the moment when others have counted her out.",
      "Street murders and rough San Francisco politics",
      "Harris\u2019s time in law enforcement began just out of law school in Alameda County, California - which includes the cities of Berkeley and her hometown of Oakland.",
      "During the 1990s, in the midst of the government's \"war on drugs\", Oakland struggled with violent crime.",
      "For a junior prosecutor, the job was daunting. But the severity of the cases you had to deal with meant it was considered a top job for a young and ambitious attorney, said Teresa Drenick, who worked with Harris at the time.",
      "\u201cIt was like a potboiler of an atmosphere. The amount of grief and agony you ingested every day was hard to process. For us, it was intense. The stakes being high, the crimes being so serious,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "\"It was near the height of the crack-cocaine epidemic. There were gang murders, street corner murders taking place. There was a lot going on in Oakland that enabled you as a prosecutor to handle some of the most serious cases that a prosecutor is ever going to handle.\"",
      "Ms Drenick and Harris were on the same trial team together. She admired Harris\u2019s confidence in front of a jury, and her respect for her colleague only grew when Harris was transferred to a different team in the same courthouse focused on child sexual assault.",
      "\"She was very, very caring of victims of child abuse. She was able to speak to them in a way that allowed them to open up to her,\u201d she said.",
      "It was at this time that Harris dated Willie Brown, a local political kingmaker and speaker of the California State Assembly who helped launch the careers of some of the state\u2019s other most prominent political leaders, including Gavin Newsom, the current governor, and San Francisco Mayor London Breed.",
      "Brown appointed her to two state boards and introduced her to some of San Francisco\u2019s highest-profile Democratic donors. The short-lived romance ended by the time Brown was elected as the city\u2019s mayor in 1995. Three years later, Harris took a job at the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "During her relationship with Brown, who was 30 years her senior, Harris had begun mingling with some of the city\u2019s political heavyweights.",
      "San Francisco's political machine, which Harris has described as \u201ca bare-knuckled sport\u201d, has launched the careers of some of the nation\u2019s biggest political stalwarts including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the late Senator Dianne Feinstein.",
      "Harris forged relationships with both of them, rising alongside contemporaries like Newsom, as she found her feet in the political world.",
      "Her swift rise through San Francisco\u2019s rough-and-tumble politics were defined by days in courtrooms representing victims and nights at glitzy political galas.",
      "This was also around the time that Harris met one of her closest friends \u2013 and most significant donors - Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.",
      "Jobs donated $500 to Harris\u2019s 2003 campaign for San Francisco district attorney, which she won, toppling the man who had hired her. Twenty years later, the billionaire philanthropist donated nearly $1m to the Biden-Harris re-election campaign, according to Fortune Magazine. It\u2019s not known how much she has directly contributed to Harris\u2019s bid for the presidency, but the amount is considered substantial.",
      "\u2018No exception to principle\u2019",
      "On the day before Easter in 2004, just four months into Kamala Harris\u2019s tenure as the district attorney of San Francisco, a gang member brandishing an AK-47 rifle fatally shot a 29-year old police officer named Isaac Espinoza.",
      "The slaying stunned the city, with many politicians and prominent members of the police calling for the death penalty.",
      "But Harris, who had made opposition to capital punishment a key part of her political campaign to become the city\u2019s top prosecutor, instead decided to pursue a life sentence without parole. She made her decision public just 48 hours after the murder, without informing the widow first.",
      "\u201cShe did not call me,\u201d Espinoza told CNN in 2019. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why she went on camera to say that without talking to the family. It\u2019s like, you can\u2019t even wait till he\u2019s buried?\u201d",
      "The backlash was swift. Speaking at the officer\u2019s funeral, Senator Feinstein demanded his killer \u201cpay the ultimate price\u201d. While walking out of the church service, she told reporters that had she known Harris was against the death penalty, she probably wouldn't have endorsed her.",
      "\u201c[T]here can be no exception to principle,\u201d Harris later wrote in an opinion piece in the San Francisco Chronicle, defending her decision.",
      "Long-time civil rights attorney John Burris, who supported Harris\u2019s decision at the time, said he thought it was \u201cpolitically was not wise for her, but it was a philosophical position she took\u201d.",
      "\"She was pretty bold in her position and she did take a lot of heat for it,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThat was a pretty progressive stand.\u201d",
      "The incident could have been the end of her political ambitions, but Harris, who had grown up with a single mother in the working-class city of Oakland, carried on.",
      "\u201cIs she a political animal? Absolutely not. Is she naturally skilled? Yes,\u201d said Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris\u2019s two successful campaigns for California attorney general in 2010 and 2014. \u201cFor her, politics is the means to the end. She is focused on the end result and the impact she can have on people\u2019s lives less than the process.\u201d",
      "Harris seemed to absorb some lessons from her first major decision as San Francisco district attorney. Four years later, she again declined to pursue the death penalty after a dramatic killing, but this time, she better understood how her decision would reverberate.",
      "Tony Bologna had been driving in San Francisco with his three sons when their vehicle was barraged by gunfire. Bologna and two of his sons were killed; his third son was critically injured.",
      "Shortly after the killing, police arrested Edwin Ramon Uma\u00f1a, an undocumented member of the MS-13 gang who had evidently mistaken the 49-year old Bologna for a sworn enemy.",
      "This time, Harris opted to deliver the difficult news about her prosecutorial decision to Bologna\u2019s widow Danielle herself, recalls Matt Davis, who was representing Danielle Bologna in a civil suit against the city at the time.",
      "\u201cIt was no surprise that Danielle had a very strong, negative reaction to the news,\u201d Mr Davis told the BBC in a recent interview. \u201cShe made it clear that she was upset, and Kamala listened to her and expressed her sympathies but stayed pretty firm.\u201d",
      "The meeting left an indelible impression on Davis. He had befriended Harris in law school in San Francisco, and when she had first revealed her plans to run for D.A., he remembers thinking she didn\u2019t have a chance.",
      "But he says that painful conversation made him realise he had underestimated her.",
      "\u201cThat was not an easy thing to do,\u201d Mr Davis said.",
      "Progressive prosecutor?",
      "Over the span of her law enforcement career, Harris\u2019s allies sought to paint her as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d committed to criminal justice reform but also tough on crime.",
      "It was a fine line to walk in a liberal city in the country\u2019s largest left-leaning state, and one that critics on both sides of the political aisle say she did not stick to.",
      "As district attorney, she adopted a so-called \u201csmart-on-crime\u201d philosophy, which included initiatives to keep non-violent offenders out of prison by steering them into job training programs and ensuring young offenders remained in school.",
      "Niki Solis, an attorney in the San Francisco public defender\u2019s office who worked opposite Harris in the early 2000s, said she had been receptive to her concerns about how young victims of sex trafficking were being charged with prostitution, as opposed to being treated as victims.",
      "\u201cI realised that she understood issues that a lot of her predecessors and a lot of [district attorneys] up and down the state failed to understand or even acknowledge,\u201d said Ms Solis.",
      "Trump and his allies on the right have sought to play up this time in her career, depicting her as part of a \u201cSan Francisco liberal elite\u201d. But on the left of politics, she has been accused of not being reform-minded enough, with some on social media nicknaming her \u201cKamala the cop\u201d.",
      "But by the time Harris was elected as California\u2019s attorney general, in 2010, her progressive tendencies appeared to have given way to political pragmatism.",
      "\"She was seeking more of a national profile. She wanted to make a mark. There was definitely an expectation of an interesting future to come,\u201d said Gil Duran, who worked for Harris in the attorney general\u2019s office for a few months.",
      "\"The attorney general - usually a sleepy backwater of an office - was now home to a rising star.\"",
      "On the national stage, Harris began to make her mark. In 2012, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Harris threatened to walk away from negotiations on a financial settlement between state attorneys general and five US banks. California was set to receive around $4 billion in the initial deal, and Harris eventually secured $18 billion for the state.",
      "The Harris campaign has highlighted this case on the campaign trail as more proof she\u2019s willing to stand up to powerful interests.",
      "But more recent reporting shows that only $4.5 billion of the settlement ended up going towards California homeowners who had been ripped off by lenders.",
      "In moves that angered some liberals, she implemented a school truancy program state-wide, which some county prosecutors used to arrest parents. And she defied a Supreme Court order to reduce overcrowding in the state\u2019s prisons.",
      "She also reversed her previous position on the death penalty in 2014 when, as attorney general, she appealed a lower court\u2019s ruling that found it was unconstitutional. Now, the prosecutor who once refused to sentence violent murderers to death on the basis that \"there is no exception to principle\" was defending the state\u2019s right to do just that.",
      "Hadar Aviram, a criminal justice and civil rights professor who petitioned Harris to leave the decision in place, was one of many critics of her stance.",
      "\u201cYou are not under any obligation to defend things that are morally unjust,\u201d she told CNN in 2019 of the episode. \u201cIf you truly believe that they\u2019re morally unjust and you have an opportunity to take a stand, I think it\u2019s an imperative to do so.\u201d",
      "Former San Francisco city attorney Louise Renne, who worked with Harris when she first left Oakland, said the torrent of criticism she faced over her support for the death penalty was unfair.",
      "\u201cThe thing is when you\u2019re state attorney general, you have to defend the law. That\u2019s your obligation,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201c I don\u2019t regard that as a weakness or a valid criticism at all.\u201d",
      "But Harris was selective about which laws she enforced. In 2004, when Gavin Newsom, then San Francisco's mayor, decided to allow same-sex weddings, in violation of state law, Harris helped officiate a few of the ceremonies, calling it \u201cone of the most joyful\u201d moments of her career.",
      "Her long record as a prosecutor would prove tricky when, after being elected to the US Senate in 2016, Harris decided to run for the Democratic presidential nomination.",
      "She chose to kick off her 2020 presidential run just blocks away from the Alameda County Courthouse, the same place where she first uttered the words, \u201cfor the people\u201d \u2013 which would become part of her campaign slogan.",
      "But in the midst of her campaign, George Floyd, an unarmed black man, was murdered by a police officer during an arrest, igniting a nationwide racial reckoning and demand for criminal justice reform. Her past defence of the death penalty, and resistance to prison reform, earned her criticism from her party\u2019s left-flank.",
      "She dropped out of the presidential race before the primary contests to choose a Democratic contender had even begun.",
      "Reinvented again",
      "Now, as Harris campaigns for president against Donald Trump, she is again calling attention to her prosecutorial bona-fides, but reframed in a new political atmosphere.",
      "While many cities, including San Francisco, experimented with progressive police reform after Floyd\u2019s murder, a spike in crime and homelessness during the pandemic has triggered a public backlash against so-called \u201csoft on crime\u201d policies. Republicans have also heavily focused on political messaging around crime and public safety in recent years.",
      "Harris\u2019s past as a prosecutor is no longer such a liability, and in a race against the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes, the narrative aligns with the political moment.",
      "Notably, at the Democratic National Convention this summer, abolishing the death penalty was dropped from the party platform.",
      "And while in 2020, Harris was trying to win over left-leaning Democrats, she is now explicitly making a pitch for moderate Republicans who may be fed up with Trump. To do that, she has shifted a number of her positions - from border security to single-payer health care - to the centre.",
      "This has led to accusations from her opponents that she is a flip-flopper.",
      "She\u2019s \u201ca chameleon\u201d, Trump\u2019s running mate and Ohio Senator JD Vance told CNN in August. \u201cShe pretends to be one thing in front of one audience and she pretends to be something different in front of another audience.\u201d",
      "But Mr Duran, Harris's former colleague in the attorney general\u2019s office, sees it less as a matter of political scrupulousness and more simply a sign of her political pragmatism.",
      "\"I think she does have conviction but it\u2019s really hard to run a campaign on your convictions alone, for the most part,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Kamala Harris we\u2019re seeing now is very much poll and focus-group driven.\u201d",
      "What Harris really stands for has been a question that has dogged her throughout her career - and continues to follow her on her bid for the Oval Office. But to Mr Brokaw, her former campaign manager, she has always operated on her own terms.",
      "\u201cShe has carved her own path and left a whole bunch of people behind who counted her out and underestimated her,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Two UK-based Africans tell the BBC how they are digging deep into their culture to change home decor.",
    "story": [
      "After more than a decade as a lawyer at high-powered banking firms like Goldman Sachs and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Nigerian-British Kelechi Ejikeme left the corporate world to follow her passion for interior design.",
      "Her rug collection is inspired by Nigeria's diverse terrain - rolling hills, winding rivers, sprawling savannahs and dense forests, and reminds me of the view from planes.",
      "\"So, when you interpret that into a rug or a carpet, it\u2019s symbolic,\" she said when I met her at her stall at the Decorex interior design show held in London last month.",
      "\"It\u2019s like, every minute, this is what we're actually every day stepping on.\"",
      "Made from jute, a durable and eco-friendly material, each rug integrates these natural elements.",
      "Jute is typically cultivated locally for its edible leaves, not for fibre. It comes from the same plant used for ewedu soup, a staple in south-western Nigeria.",
      "To bring her vision to life, Ejikeme has her rugs produced in India and Nepal, where jute is more widely developed into a thriving industry.",
      "Also at the event was Amechi Mandi, a Cameroonian-Nigerian interior designer who won House & Garden magazine\u2019s Rising Star award in 2022.",
      "He was not showcasing any of his work but had just spoken in a side session about his transition from fashion to interior design.",
      "Mandi holds a degree in furniture and product design, but after working in the fashion industry and later at a design firm, he became increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of genuine African-inspired interior textiles.",
      "Too often, he found, they relied on \"clich\u00e9d\", post-colonial motifs.",
      "This led him to explore his Cameroonian and Nigerian heritage, with a focus on pre-colonial traditions.",
      "Recognising the untapped potential of indigenous textiles fading from memory -especially with the rise of \"ankara\" wax prints, a European import that has come to symbolise African design - Mandi set out to revive these cultural elements.",
      "He began integrating traditional techniques and patterns into his designs, and his work now includes a popular collection of cushions and throws, as well as a successful wallpaper collaboration.",
      "\"People have told me, 'Oh, your work is not African,' because they want to see ankara prints. It's been so impressed in the minds,\" Mandi told me.",
      "\"I get inspiration from indigenous traditions and cultures, and then, I give it a more contemporary spin,\" he added.",
      "Listening to Mandi made me realise how much I, too, had come to associate modern African design with ankara fabrics.",
      "This textile has dominated African fashion and design, making its mark on global stages in recent decades.",
      "And so, as I wandered through the exhibition, it was easy to assume that African designs were absent from this notable gathering.",
      "When she first started, Ejikeme juggled both law and interior design, working in one during the week and the other on weekends. It did not take long for her to realise where her true passion lay.",
      "\"In one world, you\u2019re trying to contain your energy or yourself or your expression just so that you don\u2019t ruffle feathers, while in another world your energy, you can\u2019t even extinguish it,\" she said.",
      "Since making the leap to full-time design six years ago, she has tackled a variety of projects, from homes and workplaces to movie sets.",
      "Last year, she launched her own rug collection, adding a new dimension to her work from her Swallow and Tea studio.",
      "\"It\u2019s a really new thing and I\u2019ve only had two shows but so far I\u2019ve had mostly residential and retail buyers mainly from Europe probably because my first show was in Belgium. Decorex was my first UK show,\" Ejikeme said.",
      "Most of Mandi\u2019s customers are Europeans, a trend he attributes to a prevailing preference among many Africans for foreign products.",
      "\"Most Africans still prefer to buy a Gucci,\" he said.",
      "\"I do have a few Africans buying but they are not like everyday Africans. They were all people who were born and bred abroad and are deep into African heritage and culture.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi concur that interior design in Africa is still in its developmental stages.",
      "In contrast to fashion, which has long been a significant focus for Africans and has recently experienced remarkable growth, the field of African interior design is just starting to establish itself.",
      "Ejikeme reflected on her first independent project in 2013, which coincided with a new wave of Africans in London entering high-paying fields like investment banking.",
      "She aimed to create spaces that not only exuded luxury and comfort but also captured a sense of home for her African clients, reflecting their heritage in a meaningful way.",
      "\"I was stumped because I'm somebody who loves antiques. I love old design. When I was in design school in London, my favourite thing was history of design, like learning about all the different periods - Victorian, Edwardian, etc - and what distinguished one from the other.",
      "\"But there was no such thing in Africa. There's nothing like the history of African design because we haven't really kept that track,\" she said.",
      "This realisation motivated her to begin categorising African design periods to better understand and preserve the continent's design evolution, an ongoing project she began during her past 10 years living in Nigeria before returning to London last year.",
      "Ejikeme visited places like the Bogobiri art gallery in Lagos, which displayed a mixture of old sculpture and modern art.",
      "She also visited sellers in quiet corners of Nigerian markets, where she came across staffs of office used by Igbo elders in precolonial times. She began categorising these objects she came across according to their period in history, whether late 1990s or pre-colonial.",
      "She has not yet finished and wants to devote more time to it to use them in her interior design projects.",
      "Mandi believes that following trends in how we design our homes and other spaces was historically never an African thing, especially with the centuries of the transatlantic slave trade.",
      "\"Traditionally, interiors have never been a priority. We have always been into functionality. We were more into decorating our exteriors, like painting the walls, painting the outside,\" he said.",
      "\"Each civilization has evolved, but we didn\u2019t have the chance to evolve because of the 400 years we were arrested with the transatlantic slave trade.\"",
      "He added that Africans were in \"constant flight\" during the slave trade, so \"how can you think, 'I have this house, I have to make the inside fine, let me put that bench, let me weave this cloth'? Our society didn't have the chance to evolve like that.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi noted that many wealthy and prominent Africans, from celebrities to entrepreneurs, often have interiors that lack a distinctly African identity.",
      "However, Ejikeme believes this is changing as more Africans gain disposable income, they are increasingly investing in decorating their homes in a way that tells their personal story and captures their experiences.",
      "\"If you have a product that can be made beautiful, and exquisite, and sort of memorable, that tells some kind of story or has some kind of meaning, it will appeal to Africans and other people that are not African,\" she says.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:51:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Why are still no closer to unmasking the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto?",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry, is now traded by the world's biggest investment houses and is even an official currency in one country.",
      "But despite its meteoric rise, a deep mystery remains at its heart: what is the true identity of its founder, the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto?",
      "Many have tried to answer that question, but so far all have failed. In October, a high-profile HBO documentary suggested that a Canadian bitcoin expert called Peter Todd was he. The only problem: he said he was not, and the crypto world largely shrugged it off.",
      "So, inevitably, ears pricked up across our newsroom - and the crypto world at large - when on Thursday a call went out that the mysterious creator of Bitcoin was to, finally, unmask himself at a press conference.",
      "There is deep interest in who Satoshi Nakamoto is in part because they are considered a revolutionary programmer who helped spawn the crypto industry.",
      "Their voice, opinions and world view would be extremely influential on an industry with such a devoted and zealous fanbase.",
      "But the fascination also stems from the fact that, as the holder of more than one million bitcoins, Satoshi would be a multi-billionaire, not least because the price of the coins is currently close to an all-time high.",
      "Given that vast wealth, it was somewhat unusual to be asked by the organiser of Thursday\u2019s press conference to pay for my seat at his grand unveiling.",
      "A front row seat would be \u00a3100. It was another \u00a350 if I wanted unlimited questions. Organiser Charles Anderson even encouraged me to spend \u00a3500 in exchange for the privilege of interviewing \"Satoshi\" on stage.",
      "I declined.",
      "Mr Anderson said I could come along any way but cautioned there might not be a seat for me, such was the level of anticipation.",
      "As it happened, seating wasn\u2019t a problem.",
      "Only around a dozen reporters turned up to the prestigious Frontline Club - which interrupted proceedings at one point to stress it only provided a room, and not any official endorsement.",
      "Very soon it became clear that all attendees were extremely sceptical.",
      "After some digging it emerged both the organiser and the purported Satoshi were currently embroiled in a complex legal fight over fraud allegations - linked to claims to be Satoshi.",
      "It was an unpromising start, and things only got worse from there.",
      "Mr Anderson invited \"Satoshi\" to come on stage.",
      "A man called Stephen Mollah, who had been sat silently on the side the whole time walked up and resolutely declared: \u201cI am here to make a statement that yes: I am Satoshi Nakamoto and I created the Bitcoin on Blockchain technology.\u201d",
      "Over the following hour, reporters went from amused to irritated as he failed to provide any of the promised evidence for his claims.",
      "Mr Mollah promised that he would make the Hail-Mary move of unlocking and interacting with the first-ever Bitcoins to be created - something that only Satoshi could do.",
      "But he didn't.",
      "I departed, along with other bemused reporters, taking with us any lingering doubts that this would prove to be yet another dead-end in the quest to unmask Satoshi.",
      "What is Bitcoin? Key crypto terms and what they mean",
      "Not another one",
      "The list of those identified - unsuccessfully - as Satoshi Nakamoto is long.",
      "In 2014, a high-profile article in Newsweek said it was Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese-American man living in California.",
      "But he denied it and the claim has largely been debunked.",
      "A year later, Australian computer scientist Craig Wright was outed as Satoshi by reporters.",
      "He denied it, before saying it was true - but then failed over many years to produce any evidence.",
      "In the spring the High Court in London ruled that Mr Wright was not the inventor.",
      "Tech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrency after a former employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it.",
      "Which brings us to the question: does it really matter?",
      "The crypto market's current valuation means it is worth more than Google. And it seems inconceivable that the tech giant would play such a big role in our lives without people knowing who founded it, and owned a sizeable chunk of the firm.",
      "Perhaps there\u2019s good reason for the real Satoshi to keep schtum though. That bitcoin stash would make them worth an estimated $69bn and their life and character would no doubt be heavily scrutinised if they were found.",
      "Peter Todd, who was named by the HBO documentary as being Satoshi, said the unwelcome attention he's received has made him fearful for his safety.",
      "Many in the crypto world enjoy the fact that the mystery remains unsolved.",
      "\"No-one knows who Satoshi is and that's a good thing,\" Adam Back, one of its core developers (and another potential Satoshi candidate) posted on X recently.",
      "Natalie Brunell, a Bitcoin podcaster, thinks Satoshi's anonymity is not only deliberate but essential.",
      "\"By concealing his true identity, Satoshi ensured that Bitcoin wouldn\u2019t have a leader or central figure, whose personal agenda could influence the protocol,\" she told me.",
      "\"This allows people to trust Bitcoin as a system, rather than placing their trust in an individual or company.\"",
      "Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University - who lectures on the history of Bitcoin - is less sure.",

      "And of course this is a company that holds the most sensitive data imaginable about its customers, raising troubling questions about what might happen to its huge \u2013 and extremely valuable \u2013 database of individual human DNA.",
      "When contacted by the BBC, 23andMe was bullish about its prospects - and insistent it remained \"committed to protecting customer data and consistently focused on maintaining the privacy of our customers.\"",
      "But how did what was once one of the most talked-about tech firms get to the position where it has to answer questions about its very survival?",

      "Fast forward three years and that price has slumped to just under $5 - and the company is worth 2% of what it once was.",
      "What went wrong?",
      "According to Professor Dimitris Andriosopoulos, founder of the Responsible Business Unit at Strathclyde University, the problem for 23andMe was twofold.",
      "Firstly, it didn\u2019t really have a continuing business model \u2013 once you\u2019d paid for your DNA report, there was very little for you to return for.",

      "\"It's worrying because of the sensitivity of the data,\" says Carissa Veliz, author of Privacy is Power.",
      "And that is not just for the individuals who have used the firm.",
      "\"If you gave your data to 23andMe, you also gave the genetic data of your parents, your siblings, your children, and even distant kin who did not consent to that,\" she told the BBC.",

      "Democrats in general have had an especially tough time with white, non-college educated voters, male and female.

      "MSNBC was running images of Nazi rallies from Germany side by side with images from Madison Square Garden a week ago. So, there \u2013 you asked me, why are they so confident?",
      "If you're so confident about victory, the way that the Harris people say they are, then why would you be out there attacking not Donald Trump, attacking anyone who is thinking about voting for him by labeling them as, if you vote for Donald Trump, you're this evil, horrible human being?",
      "That doesn't seem to be like the actions of a confident campaign. It seems to me like the actions of a scared one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I was speaking specifically about that \u2013 that outreach that you've been doing to Hispanic voters. It sounds like you think this is negligible.",
      "But let me ask you about women voters, because we're seeing in our data that the Trump campaign may have an issue there.",
      "Here's what former Trump administration U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said this past week about that Madison Square Garden rally.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "FORMER GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY (R-South Carolina): This bromance and this masculinity stuff, I mean, it borders on edgy, to the point that it's going to make women uncomfortable. You have got affiliated PACs that are doing commercials about calling Kamala the C-word. Or you had speakers at Madison Square Garden referring to her and her pimps.",
      "That is not the way to win women.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you share the former governor's concerns that this is a vulnerability?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I want to point out, and no one talks about this, Kamala Harris has a bigger problem among men than Donald Trump does among women.",
      "Are there women that are going to vote for Kamala Harris? Of course. Are there women that don't like Donald Trump? Of course. Are there women that are going to support Donald Trump? Yes, there are, a lot of them.",
      "And I think you'll see that bear out on Election Day. Ultimately, the bottom line is that what this election is going to be about, when people go vote, they're not \u2013 they're going to be voting on three things that are critical to them. How much does it cost to live in this country, and can you afford the things that people work hard to be able to afford? Because over the last four years, they have not.",
      "Do you feel safe and secure? And the answer is, no, people do not face \u2013 feel safe and secure, when you have dangerous criminal elements entering this country across the open border that Kamala Harris allowed. And number three is, how close is this country to being dragged into some sort of global conflict?",
      "We now have troops from North Korea side by side with Russians on the ground in Ukraine. We're edging closer every single month to some broader global conflict that could involve the United States. And guess who's going to have to go fight in those wars? The sons and the daughters and the children of the people who are going to decide this election, and that includes over half the country, which is women voters.",
      "That's what's going to be on people's mind, and that's what should be on their mind, because that's what's at stake in this election.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of safety and security, that sound bite a moment ago from Donald Trump talking about training guns on the face of Liz Cheney, the Trump campaign\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: That's not what he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 says that was about foreign policy.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: It was\u2026;",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we just played it for our viewers and listeners who heard it.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't it possible to make the case without using rhetoric like that?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: But Donald Trump doesn't talk like someone who's been in Washington for 30 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Training guns on her face?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: He doesn't say it the way I would have said it. No, but that's not what he said, Margaret. You guys know that. Come on.",
      "I mean, everybody knows exactly what he was saying. What he was saying is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We played the sound bite.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 you're so much in favor of war.",
      "Yes, you \u2013 no, you played a piece of the sound bite, because, in another piece of it, he said he would give her a gun to go stand in conflict as well. You don't normally give a gun to someone that is going to be facing a firing squad, which is what much of the media made it sound like.",
      "The point he was making is not a new point. It is a point that has been made by people in both parties for decades. And that is, you're all for war, and it's easy to be for war when you're in some fancy building and you're safe and sound in Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Let's see how much you are for war when you yourself get deployed into combat. That's the point that he was making.",
      "That he uses language that maybe is not what we typically hear from someone that works at a think tank\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 well, fine.",
      "But I think it's truly, not just unfair, it's egregious to see that reported the way that it was, along with other things that are out there. I have never seen such a concerted effort.",
      "And, look, I have always believed there's bias, because no one's unbiased, but I have never seen such a concerted effort like what I have seen, especially in the last two weeks, among multiple media outlets in this country to, in some cases, breathlessly distort and lie about what's being said and to create and manufacture these gotcha moments against Donald Trump.",
      "I have never seen it before.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: It's over the top.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, you are the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee. You also know that former commander in chief is not just some guy off the street, and words matter.",
      "U.S. intelligence has specifically warned\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: They do matter. They do matter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 specifically warned about the risk of political violence in this country, some of it stoked by foreign adversaries, Iran trying to do that, Russia trying to do that, in the days after the election.",
      "Are you confident in the security and the integrity of the election?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm confident in the security and integrity of the elections, and especially because we have strong systems across this country.",
      "It's spread across 50 states. That doesn't mean there aren't going to be problems. We saw problems earlier in the week in Pennsylvania, and they were resolved by a court, where people were not allowed \u2013 being allowed in one county from accessing their on-demand mail ballot at the spot. There are going to be issues like that.",
      "They're being confronted at the front end, and those things are being looked at. Look, in the state of Michigan, we know now \u2013 and this is not me making it up. I can't believe it hasn't received more coverage. A Chinese national registered to vote and voted. And now he's being charged for doing that. But guess what? His ballot is going to count.",
      "We know at least one noncitizen's ballot is going to count in Michigan because they don't know which ballot it is and they can't retrieve it. These are facts. Now, whether that's widespread or not, I hope not, but these are things that are happening, and they need to be watched at.",
      "As far as foreign adversaries, sure. I mean, Iran wants to kill Donald Trump. Iran \u2013 this has been fully documented. They are trying to kill Donald Trump. You talk about violent rhetoric. He's the only candidate in this race, and not because I wish this on anybody else, who's had not one, but two assassination attempts against his life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. So\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: So, of course we're all concerned about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "In terms of the case you talked about in Michigan, we have tracked that. The secretary of state of that state has actually brought charges, has made that public. That individual may actually be deported\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Yes. But that vote's still going to count.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 may actually be deported because there are laws in this country that punish people\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: They are. But the vote still counts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 when they are illegal, and they try to vote in federal elections. That 19-year-old is going to face some consequences.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Correct. But the vote still counts.",
      "He is. And he's going to \u2013 but his vote still counts. His vote will still be counted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. I'm just trying to make clear that there are systems\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: But that's a big deal. I think that's a big deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 as you pointed to, as the courts are also playing a role here.",
      "I need to ask you about China, though. This massive and pervasive hacking by China of U.S. telecom companies is significant. Your colleague Mark Warner said it's the most significant breach he has ever seen in his entire time on the committee.",
      "Do you know if China has been able to access the audio of Americans' phone calls?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm not going to comment on what they access, but I agree with Mark Warner's statement.",
      "It is an egregious, outrageous and dangerous breach of our telecommunications systems across multiple companies. I will leave it at that. I think, as time goes on, we're going to learn more about it. Some of it will be made public. I think there's more that's still being gathered.",
      "It's a very serious situation that we face and I think one that is quite threatening, maybe not directly to the election\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 per se, but certainly to the national security of our country moving forward. It's a vulnerability that no one imagined or anticipated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: But here it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Senator Rubio, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined by Nevada Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, who joins us from Las Vegas.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO (D-Nevada): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to be tracking your state very closely and all six of its electoral votes.",
      "In this early vote, we've seen half of Nevada's active registered voters have cast ballots, and there's some anxiety among Democrats because Republicans currently have a lead statewide. Are you confident the remaining ballots will close that gap and deliver the state to Harris?",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, Margaret, I can tell you a couple of things.",
      "One, I am optimistic that we are going to win, not only for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, but for Jacky Rosen, in this state. I am absolutely confident in our ground game, in our canvassing and knocking on doors and talking to our voters, because that's literally what matters here, is making sure that our voters, who are paying attention now in a swing state like Nevada, that somebody is talking to them, because there's so much information out there.",
      "And now is the time for us to connect with our voters and talk to them about the issues that they care about. So, yes, I am very, very confident.",
      "And the only other thing, let me say this, Margaret, is, you know, I was reelected just recently, and there was a Republican advantage in my race, in my midterm, and I won. Not only did I win. Our congressional delegation won. And so we also won our \u2013 our state seats in our state House.",
      "So what we know in Nevada, it is really about that organization. It's knocking on those doors. It's phone-banking. It's talking to our voters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: We also have a large population of our voters who are nonpartisan. Over a third are nonpartisan. And those are the independents in other states, and they lean Democratic. They leaned my way.",
      "And so I am very, very confident that, as we are working our ground game, we're going to organize our way to victory here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 you mentioned your victory in 2022. That was just by 8,000 votes. So this \u2013 this could be a tight one as well this time around.",
      "The Trump campaign talks about making inroads with the working-class population, in particular, on the issue of the economy. Your state has the second highest unemployment rate in the country. The majority of voters do not have a college degree.",
      "Why shouldn't the Trump campaign be confident that they are making inroads with this key demographic?",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, a couple of things, Margaret. You talked about my \u2013 my tight race. They're always tight in Nevada. It's a swing state. They're always close. It's always within the margin.",
      "And that's why it is important you get out and talk to voters and you don't take anyone for granted. And you're right. A large part of our population, our service industry, those are high school-educated individuals. That's my family. They worked in this industry.",
      "And these are the individuals we want to talk to. But we also have been engaging them on the issues that matter to them. And if you look at our strong organized labor, which is the culinary, which is made up most of the service industry, along with our building trades, they're knocking on those doors in favor of the Democrats, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.",
      "So there is this outright concerted effort by everyone to make sure our voters understand who is \u2013 what's at stake here. And there's a stark difference. I mean, you know, let me just say\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: \u2026 because this is important for voters to know this, that Kamala Harris has already talked about, she wants to represent everyone. She wants to lift everybody up.",
      "No matter who voted for her, she's going to represent them. She's going to start day one with a to-do list to how she works on the issues that she knows that many voters are challenged with. Donald Trump is going to walk in the Oval Office with an enemies list. There's a difference between the two.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: And when you talk to voters about it who are expecting that in Nevada, in a swing state, that makes the difference in whether or not we are going to win. And we are going to win.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does your party \u2013 we played what the current president, Joe Biden, said about Trump supporters, and some have compared that, Republicans have compared that to what Hillary Clinton said about a basket of deplorables.",
      "Does your party have a disdain problem in talking down to working class voters in particular?",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, I can tell you here in Nevada in general \u2013 first of all, let's just say, but \u2013 we know this, that President Biden clarified his statement, and Kamala Harris has made it very clear she wants to represent everyone, no matter\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he quibbled about an apostrophe in the transcript.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: But \u2013 but Kamala Harris made it very clear moving forward that she wants to represent everyone, right, no matter whether you voted for her or not.",
      "And whoever you vote for, you shouldn't be criticized for that. And she's made that very clear.",
      "What \u2013 what I hear from voters in Nevada \u2013 and this is where the \u2013 where it's relevant, not the spin rooms, not the polls, not what you're hearing on the national news, but what are voters saying, and what do they care about? And they're listening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: And I can tell you, my voters in Nevada that I talk to, which is really a large population of not only our blue- collar, but minority Latinos, a \u2013 excuse me, Asian American Pacific Islanders, a vibrant Black community, Native Americans \u2013 they are listening to, what are the issues?",
      "Who's bringing the solutions, right? Who has the solutions to address the affordable housing issue? That's Kamala Harris.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Who has the issues to address how we lower health care costs and keep them low for all Americans? Kamala Harris. Who has the idea about how we protect the Affordable Care Act and not repeal it? That's Kamala Harris.",
      "So those conversations matter to my voters in Nevada, and that's what's relevant at the end of the day and how we're going to make this happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And your state also will be key to watch. You do have abortion on the ballot.",
      "Even though it's already legal in your state, there is talk about enshrining it in the Constitution, based on what happens Tuesday. We'll be following that and what happens with your party.",
      "Senator, we have to leave it there for time. Thank you.",
      "We'll be back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Be sure to tune into CBS News on Tuesday night, when we will be live from our election headquarters in New York City. I will be there, along with Norah O'Donnell, John Dickerson, Gayle King, and the rest of our political team for what is likely to be a very long night.",
      "Our coverage starts at 4:00 p.m. Eastern on CBS News 24/7 Streaming, 7:00 p.m. Eastern on the CBS television network.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION, and our panel of election law and security experts.",
      "David Becker is the executive director of the Center for Election, Innovation and Research. Chris Krebs is the former head of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under the Trump administration. And Samantha Vinograd was most recently a counterterrorism official at the Department of Homeland Security under the Biden administration.",
      "Good morning to you all.",
      "Setting the table for a consequential week.",
      "Chris, I want to start with you.",
      "We're in that 48-hour window that Microsoft warned was going to be rife with attempts to hack people's minds. We've seen at least four fake videos the FBI and U.S. intelligence have warned are meant to manipulate. Yesterday, the FBI said there were two out there that are fake. Before that we had disclosed that Russia was behind a Bucks County, Pennsylvania, fake video and one targeting voters in Georgia, falsely claiming that Haitian migrants were - were voting.",
      "How do these tactics that Russia is using now compare to what you saw in 2020 and back in 2016?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, they've evolved their techniques from generating and launching content from, for instance, St. Petersburg. That's what we saw in 2016. You had the internet research agency operating out of an office building, almost like, you know, a normal business.",
      "Over time, though, given the improvements in the intelligence community, cyber command, and our own awareness of the activities and what they're doing, they've started to push the boundaries out. And so they're actually generating content and then they're laundering it effectively through other platforms, like Telegram and even now what we're seeing is a significant amount of laundering through X.",
      "And then U.S. citizens pick up this information and pick up these videos, and then they promote it on their own accounts and on their own social media platforms, like Facebook. So, they are moving it out. They're avoiding the techniques that U.S. law enforcement intelligence has deployed and developed. And so they're not as good though. So, a lot of these videos that we're seeing, they're actually quite amateurish. That's not to say they can't have better content coming forward, but really they're just kind of flooding the zone and trying to distract.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And confuse and sow - and sow distrust of our institutions.",
      "Sam, U.S. intelligence has been briefing and disclosing. That's part of what they're doing to try to counteract this.",
      "We also saw early on warnings about Iran and what they are doing. The assessment Iran favors Harris, Russia favors Trump.",
      "What form of influence are we seeing?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, Iran has two main goals in this election cycle. First, to denigrate President Trump. They have expressed present - excuse me, a preference for Vice president Harris based upon Trump's record in office and their perception of what Mr. Trump would do if elected. That's objective one.",
      "Objective two is to sow discord. And they view undermining perception about thein integrity of our election as an effective tool. So, they are using influence operations to denigrate Mr. Trump and to sow discord using AI- generated content really focused in particular on, for example, allegations of voter fraud. We should expect Iran to continue increasingly sophisticated influence operations related to perceptions of a lack of election integrity. That will last well after polls close, Margaret. This is the most attenuated election security related threat environment we have likely seen in history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not about just changing votes. It's about not trusting our democracy.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: David, 76 million Americans already voted. So, can we say those numbers show the adversaries are failing, or are the election workers you're speaking with really concerned about what's to come?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Well, it's - it has increased our ability to be resilient against the disinformation. The more people who vote early, they're effectively inoculated themselves against disinformation that might be inclined to be intended to help them self-suppress their vote or confuse them about how to vote. So, the fact that we've had over 76 million vote already, and that's going to increase by several million more once all the mail ballots are in, once there's even early voting going on today, still in about 27 states and D.C. So, that's very good. That means the number of people that still need to vote on Election Day, when disinformation might be very focused on them, trying to get them confused with very little time for them to be resilient against that disinformation, that's going to affect fewer voters. That's a very good thing. And I think we're seeing, especially in states like Georgia and North Carolina, well over 4 million votes in each of those states has been cast. Millions of votes in many other - of the swing states. And so far, very few problems despite efforts to create problems perhaps from our adversaries overseas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would point people to the secretaries of state themselves, their websites, for reliable information?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Yes. Whenever you need information, go to your state election website. That's usually the secretary of state's website. Sometimes, in North Carolina, Wisconsin, there's an election commission or an election board. Go to your local election website if you know your country or locality where elections are taking place. And if you need help, go to vote.gov. That will navigate you there eventually. Go - just rely upon those sources solely for information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris, when you were in government, we did see, back in 2018, disclosure by the general at the head of then Cyber Command and the National Security Agency say that - that the government at that time set up a small group to basically knock Russia offline, to physically stop them from some of these influence operations.",
      "Can the U.S. undertake offensive operations like that now?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Absolutely. I do think though that the infrastructure that the adversaries or the Russians and the Iran have put into place may not be where it once was. It has moved. Keep in mind that earlier this year the Department of Justice took offline a disinformation group that we track as Doppelganger, they took their various websites offline. And they did it in a way that was timed so that they could not rebuild those websites and reestablish the engagement with those websites in time for the election. So, there have been steps taken to ensure that the bad guys can't execute their strategies.",
      "And in the meantime, you have organizations, like SISA, that are doing more with more jurisdictions on election security than at any other point previously. So, they have a lot of confidence around the resilience of the system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what you said about using Americans to spread disinformation.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: People are becoming unwitting agents of a foreign adversary essentially by re-tweeting or reposting some of these fake videos.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: We have seen that, right? So, there was another Department of Justice announcement that a media outlet, based out of Tennessee, was receiving funding from the Russians, from RT, a cutout (ph) -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tenet Group.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Tenet Group.",
      "Now, to David's earlier point, that is why it is so critically important that American voters, when they're looking for information about the election, they go to their relevant local or state official. They know what's going on. Go - if you're in Georgia, Brad Raffensperger and Gabe Sterling are probably running the tightest ship when it comes to elections in the country right now. They're incredibly effective. They're out there. They're putting information in the hands of the American people so they understand what's happening.",
      "And so when Russian operations like the Haitian voters pops up, they were on it immediately and they knocked it down. That is hugely effective in maintaining trust of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sam, we have seen concerns about physical security, though, as well at voting locations. The Democratic governor of Washington state has activated the National Guard, put them on stand-by, citing general and specific information and concerns about violence and unrest. You did have that drop box in Vancouver that damaged hundreds of ballots. There was an incendiary device there. Are there specific plots the federal government knows of at this time?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, it is a generally heightened threat environment, both in terms of complexity and the length of time that terrorism related threats, criminal threats and influence operations by nation states will last related to the election. It is just prudent planning, Margaret, in this threat environment for officials at all levels of government, federal, state and local, to engage in detailed operational planning. State and local officials are in the lead for the security in their jurisdictions.",
      "Now, in my experience, particularly post January 6th, those operational plans must include a full sense of all available law enforcement resources. National Guard is the last resort. You have local resources, state resources and then, as necessary, National Guard, as well as a clear sense of who to call when so that there aren't communication failures.",
      "Federal officials have invested a lot of money and time in doing exercises, hundreds them with state and local officials, sharing intelligence and information, and trying to share best practices. But at the end of the day, the state and local officials are in the lead and should have clear operational plans for a range of scenarios that may arise, in particular large scale security incidents that may arise with little or no warning. We learned lessons from January 6th. And from my conversations with former colleagues, that operational planning has been underway for years, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: David, I want to quickly get you to respond to what Senator Rubio was raising during our interview. He was talking about the charges brought by the secretary - or I mentioned the charged brought by the secretary of state against the individual he highlighted had cast a vote despite not being a citizen.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How is it that someone who's not a citizen could register and cast a ballot? How did that even happen?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Well, we have several protections in place to make sure it's very, very unlikely this is going to happen. We've seen places like Ohio, which has documented only six cases of non-citizen voting over a decade, dating back to 2014. We have places like Georgia, that has documented nine cases of non-citizen voting since 2008. So, it does happen, but it's extremely rare. And I'm sure Michigan is going to go through the process of evaluating exactly what went wrong in this one particular instance.",
      "But it's also important to note, this is one case. It was very swiftly dealt with. This individual is going to lose his administration at the University of Michigan. He's going to be prosecuted. He might go to jail. And he's almost certainly to be deported.",
      "This is a cautionary tale. It's one of the reasons we know that non-citizen voting is extremely rare. It's not zero, but it's very close to zero because the potential benefit to the person who perpetrates that crime, one vote in an election with 160 million ballots is far outweighed by the potential risk that they're facing of deportation and other jail time, et cetera.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for that.",

      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How the systems are set up to deal with these things is important.",
      "One of the things disclosed in the U.S. intelligence report put out by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was that Russia's amplifying these claims of non-citizen voting.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's what happens.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right. That's what happens. And there are plenty of protections in place to make sure that this is extremely rare. As close to zero as it can be.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To dissect some of the new economic indicators we've been seeing, we're joined by Mohamed El-Erian. He is the chief economic adviser at Allianz.",
      "Welcome back to the program.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: (Chief Economic Advisor, Allianz): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, we saw on Friday this jobs report that indicated job creation stalled a bit in October. There were some complicating factors, like hurricanes and a strike at Boeing. But what's your perspective on what this indicates for the next president of the United States?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, most of the report, as you pointed out, was distorted in a really important manner by the strikes by the hurricanes. The bottom line, Margaret, is we have an economy that has been growing robustly. Inflation is coming down. And the main challenge for the next administration is not just to maintain what is called economic exceptionalism, because we're outperforming all other advanced economies, but also to continue to reposition it for the engines of tomorrow's prosperity. And that's absolutely critical.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know the Federal Reserve is meeting later this week, may move on interest rates again since inflation is around or getting close to that 2 percent target. But for average people, they see housing prices are high, they see grocery prices are still high. Where's the scenario where those prices actually come down?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and that's what everybody's expecting, but it's not going to happen.",
      "Look, the good news is interest rates will continue to come down. The good news is inflation, which is the rate of increase of the cost of living will come down. But it's very hard to bring down prices. And that's one political problem is, when you tell people inflation is coming down, in their head they think prices are coming down, not the rate of increase of prices. So, it's a misunderstanding, unfortunately. But you've to be careful what you wish for, because if prices come down significantly, we are then in something much worse economically.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that misunderstanding being used quite a lot on the campaign trail, Mohamed, as you know.",
      "I know the stock market is not an indicator of what's happening with the economy, but it is forward-looking. This week what should we be expecting as a reaction to the outcome of this election?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, believe it or not, a lot of investors are just on the sideline. They see so many possibilities, be it for the presidential race, be it for Congress, or even the extent to which what is promised by presidential candidates will become policy. There stands to be a big gap between the two. So, quite a few investors have said, you know what, there's way too much uncertainty. I'm just standing on the sideline and waiting to see what emerges.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A gap between what's promised and what's delivered is a very diplomatic way of putting campaigning there, Mohamed. But neither candidate is even making a gesture towards reducing the debt burden in this country. And in terms of what's being promised, the plans that the vice president has put forward is estimated by this Committee for a Responsible Budget to increase the federal debt by nearly $4 trillion through 2035. Donald Trump's plans would increase it by nearly $8 trillion.",
      "Congress, as you suggested there, they can put the brakes on anything here. But does this continued promise of spending and no promise of reducing it concern you?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: It does. It does in a big way.",
      "Look, it was unthinkable that we would have almost 30 months of unemployment at 4 percent or below and we'd run fiscal deficit of six to eight percent. Remember, John Kennedy said, when the sun is shining you fix the roof. Instead, the sun has been shining on our economy and we've created more roofs. Our debt to GDP is 120 percent of - our debt is 120 percent of GDP.",
      "Look, both candidates, whether they like it or not, are going to have to find a way to moderate deficits and debt and critically, Margaret, to create operational flexibility in the budget. The budget is becoming more and more rigid, which means that it's harder to respond to unanticipated shocks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unanticipated shocks.",
      "In terms of one of the things that we have heard from the Trump campaign quite a lot is this pledge to use tariffs to create income for the government somehow. That's how Donald Trump suggests using them.",
      "Do you view tariffs as a regressive tax that will hurt poor people by raising prices for them, or do you view them as somehow, you know, a rising tide that floats all boats?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, tariffs are a dangerous tool. They have limited use, but if they are overused, they become counterproductive. It is - it is not a good idea to promise the use of tariffs to deliver all sorts of things. Be it a lower deficit, be it protecting domestic producers, be it putting pressure, leveraging influence on other countries. Tariffs have a role to play, but not to the extent - and similar for the other side. Industrial policy and regulation, they both have a role to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: But be careful of overreach.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Fair point.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now for a preview of what we'll all be looking for on Tuesday is our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, this is neck-and-neck. You've been telling us that for weeks now. What is it that the campaigns are focusing on and what we should be looking for?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Hey there, Margaret. So, start with this. Here is the map. The states in white are all those razor-tight battleground states. But let's get beyond the margin of error for a second and look at some of the political possibilities. And we can show you that in our polling models.",
      "Start with this, what I think is one of the key dynamics in this race. There are voters who say they did not vote in 2020 and many of them, in fact about four in ten, say that they definitely will this time. Among them, especially the men among them, are for Donald Trump. And the Trump campaign is trying to turn them out.",
      "So, we wondered, what happens if he does? And I'll show you. On this map we're going to run that scenario through our CBS models. And if he does turn out a lot of those non-voters, those men, they boost him, he would do well across the sun belt, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and flip Pennsylvania, and that would be enough to put him over the top and give him the win. That's a hypothetical, but it shows you how one of those campaign dynamics could play out.",
      "Now, on the other side, there's another important dynamic, and that is the gender gap. We've talked about it a lot. And I'll show you a slide from one of our recent polls that illustrate that. So many more women voting for Kamala Harris.",
      "Well, you've seen the Harris campaign out there trying not only to get women turnout, but also some crossover from Republicans, and in particular Republican women. So, we said, what happens if she can get those Republican numbers to match closer to what Joe Biden got in 2020, driven in large part by women and Republican women. If I put that scenario into the map here, our models show that she would hold the blue wall states across the upper Midwest, keep Georgia in her column, even flip North Carolina, and that would give her an Electoral College victory.",
      "All of this, again, hypothetical. But it puts it in political terms, some of the dynamics that could play out, and we'll be watching, on election night, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'll be watching in real time as the data comes in to the desk.",
      "What is it that we should be tracking throughout the night?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, we're going to show you everything as it comes in. And the first thing I'm going to show you is where the votes are, because sometimes, and I'll pull up the 2020 map here in Georgia just as an example, you're going to see red areas, Republican, you're going to see blue areas, Democratic. But I'm always going to show, there are more people in some of these place than others. If I take this map and I rotate it, you'll - what you'll see in the example of Georgia is, the higher bars reflect more votes, and there's more voters in Atlanta and metro Atlanta. And Democrats need to do well in places like that. Really get a lot of turnout there. Whereas across rural areas, you see it's more flat on the map here. Not as many votes but Republicans very consistently kind of add to their margins there. That's one way we're going to show you the state in full.",
      "The other thing I'm going to watch is patterns, shifts from the last election to this one. Again, as an example, if I were to show you the shift that happened from 2016 to 2020, in Georgia, Democrats, Joe Biden at the time, got a lot of those counties around metro Atlanta shifting blue, those rural areas shifted red, Republicans. We'll see if something like that happens again. So it's where the votes come from, how they shift and the last thing, very quickly, Margaret, I'll remind everybody is, patience. If I were to take that same Georgia timeline and show you what it looked like at say 9:00 p.m., just after poll closed, a couple hours, you see so much uncounted votes still in Georgia, Metro Atlanta hadn't counted yet, et cetera. If this pattern comes out again on election night, we'll want to say, hold on, let's wait for all the votes to get counted before we know the winner.",
      "Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Patience is a virtue.",
      "Anthony, thank you.",

    "story": [
      "Two days before Election Day, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, said she's \"very confident\" Democrats will win in her battleground state.",
      "\"I am optimistic that we are going to win, not only for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, but for Jacky Rosen in this state,\" she said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Around half of Nevada's active registered voters have cast ballots, with Republicans leading statewide, spurring anxiety among Democrats heading into Election Day. Nevada is also the only state where Republicans flipped the governor's mansion in 2022, although Cortez Masto hung onto her seat by less than 8,000 votes in that same election. But Cortez Masto said she's \"optimistic\" about Harris' chances in the Silver State, citing what she has seen as an impressive ground game and canvassing efforts from Democrats.",
      "\"That's literally what matters here, is making sure that our voters, who are paying attention now in a swing state like Nevada, that somebody is talking to them,\" Cortez Masto said. \"Now is the time for us to connect with our voters and talk to them about the issues that they care about.\"",
      "With an economy based largely around tourism and hospitality in Las Vegas, Nevada is home to a significant working class population. The Trump campaign has worked to make inroads among the voting bloc with economic policies that may be especially salient in Nevada, where the economy was among the most impacted by pandemic closures in 2020, spurring frustration with Democrat-led policies.",
      "Cortez Masto said Democrats are engaging with the working-class communities \"on the issues that matter to them,\" while touting support from organized labor. And she argued that Harris is the candidate with solutions for affordable housing and lowering health care costs, among other issues.",
      "\"That's what's relevant at the end of the day, and how we're going to make this happen,\" she said.",
      "Still, the Nevada Democrat urged that elections are \"always close\" in Nevada. And she noted that she won reelection in 2022 facing a Republican advantage \u2014 in what was the closest Senate race in the country in the midterms.",
      "Cortez Masto pointed to the state's large population of nonpartisan voters who she argued lean Democrat, saying \"they leaned my way, and so I am very, very confident that, as we are working our ground game, we're going to organize our way to victory here.\"",
      "A Republican presidential candidate hasn't won Nevada since 2004, but Democrats' margin of victory has decreased in recent years.",
      "Cortez Masto also defended President Biden after he appeared to call supporters of former President Donald Trump \"garbage,\" saying that he had clarified the remarks as being about a comedian's rhetoric at a Trump rally. And she argued that Harris, whom she worked with when they were both state attorneys general, has \"made it very clear, moving forward, that she wants to represent everyone.\"",
      "\"No matter whether you voted for her or not, and whoever you vote for, you shouldn't be criticized for that,\" Cortez Masto added.",
      "Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, downplayed Trump's connection to the comedian's remarks, while arguing that \"what's more relevant\" is Mr. Biden's comment, which he argued is in line with \"what most people in the Democratic Party and hierarchy believe.\"",
      "\"If you're so confident about victory, the way the Harris people say they are, then why would you be out there attacking not Donald Trump \u2014 attacking anyone who is thinking about voting for him,\" Rubio said. \"That doesn't seem to be like the actions of a confident campaign. It seems to me like the actions of a scared one.\"",

      "If the latest ballot measures are successful in expanding abortion access, they would override stringent bans on the procedure in five states. Roughly two dozen states have enacted abortion restrictions after Roe was reversed, and 14 of those states have near-total bans with limited exceptions.",
      "Here's where abortion is on the ballot in 2024:",

      "A ballot measure, known as Proposition 139, would create a \"fundamental right\" to abortion in Arizona. Under the proposed change to the state's constitution, the state would not be able to \"interfere with this fundamental right before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible.\" Fetal viability is generally understood to be between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy, and is defined in the ballot measure as the point when \"the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus,\" as determined by a healthcare professional.",

      "The crown jewels of Williamsburg, Virginia, are the interpreters, interacting with audiences of our day, but in the context of the world as they would have known it in their time.",
      "By way of example, Thomas Jefferson welcomes visitors: \"Good day, friends. How are you faring? You have no complaints? You must not be Virginians! If not from Virginia, where from? Pennsylvania, land of religious anarchy? Welcome! The Ohio Territories? From terra incognito. Welcome to civilization! Upper Canada? Bonjour! Are you immigrating here? Oh, you should. We are trying to encourage immigrants to immigrate here.\"",
      "Indeed, immigration was highly controversial in Jefferson's time, but from a radically different perspective than ours. I raised the issue with Kurt Smith (who personifies Thomas Jefferson), and Katherine Pittman (a very feisty Martha Washington).",
      "\"It was there in 1776,\" said Smith, \"in the Declaration of Independence. You know that middle bit that everyone skips? In the 27 long train of abuses, Jefferson says, 'He [the king] has prevented immigration.' It is one of the reasons we declare independence.\"",
      "Pittman asked, \"And how can we improve if we never welcome anything new?\"",
      "\"We're not talking about 'never' welcoming anything new,\" Koppel said. \"We need to know who's coming. We need to know whether they are people of good character. Isn't that what the argument is about?\"",
      "\"It's the argument in your time,\" Pittman said. \"We can just speak to our time.\"",
      "\"Oh, cut it out!\"",
      "\"You started it!\" Pittman laughed.",
      "\"I'm in a pissing match with Mrs. Washington, for God's sake!\" said Koppel.",
      "\"I think I'm gonna win!\" she laughed.",
      "The interpreters are well advised to merely hint at the issues of our day. Jefferson (Smith) opined, \"How do you get a body of men to vote for something because it's the right thing to do? I don't know. Maybe your politicians do it all the time!\" The audience was amused.",
      "Visitors to Williamsburg are left to grapple with the actual political problems of 2024. One woman remarked, \"There are certain people that want all the power, like the king. They wanted the power over everybody, and I think that's what's happening now.\"",
      "One young woman said, \"This country is steeped in conflict and a fight for liberty. But I truly hope I get to live in a world where I have rights to my body.\"",
      "\"Abortion,\" asked Koppel. \"You feel strongly about that?\"",
      "\"I do,\" she replied.",
      "It's a subject on which Martha Washington also has her own views on, c. 1800. In that era, she said, the issue was dealt with from within the home: \"Birth and a woman's health is a woman's sphere,\" she said. \"One does not need to ascertain the services of a midwife if that is the course that you are wishing. These remedies are known amongst female kind. It is known in the indigenous communities. It is known in the African culture. It is known in our European cultures as well, be it different herbs, be it different techniques, in order to rid one's self of an unwanted child. But generally, they are held within the female sex. But I know that my husband, General Washington, would be in full support of whatever I wanted to do with my own person.\"",
      "An even more contentious issue, then and now, was race. In Jefferson's day, that meant slavery. Despite owning more than 600 enslaved men, women and children, Jefferson put forward legislation in 1779 to end the practice. \"But here's the problem,\" Jefferson said. \"Bill 51, making the slave trade illegal, has to be presented to a body of men, all of whom own \u2026 what?\"",
      "Williamsburg chooses to depict slavery in a particularly dramatic, and unrepresentative, fashion, in the person of James Lafayette, an enslaved man who was directed to meet with the Marquis de Lafayette, the French nobleman who served the American cause (and whose name James would ultimately adopt).",
      "Lafayette asked James to sneak across the British lines as a fake runaway slave, to ingratiate himself with the officers of the British army, and then report back what he heard. James succeeded so brilliantly that he eventually worked directly under General Lord Cornwallis. \"I could take that British intelligence and information and share it with the American side over and over again, which I did,\" James said.",
      "He faithfully served the American cause, but he said, \"I was not to be given my freedom for what I had done for American independence. I was sent back to slavery. I was sent back to Master William for six more years.\"",
      "Only after the Marquis de Lafayette petitioned the Virginia legislature for his freedom would it eventually be granted.",
      "Given that extraordinary backstory, I wondered how Stephen Seals (who interprets James) deals with taking on that role. \"You understand that so many of the issues that we deal with today are connected to many of the decisions that were made in the colonial area,\" Seals said. \"You can see the line from one to the other. And when you come to terms and you see that, I got very depressed, and I almost left. I almost quit.\"",
      "Then, a colleague reminded him he was giving a voice to ancestors denied one during their own lifetimes. \"And the moment she said that to me, I had few issues with the fact that I had to play an enslaved person every single day, because I now understood why I was doing it,\" he said. \"So, I love what I do, it's an honor doing what I do, but I live out in the middle of nowhere for a reason, because when I'm done here, I want to go and be away from it all. It's how I cope.\"",
      "Finally, there's the father of our nation, George Washington. \"When we began, I mentioned that we should avoid seeing factions arise,\" he said. \"I specifically mentioned by regional distinction, but it is just as important that we endeavor to avoid seeing factions arise by the spirit and fury of party politics.\"",
      "Asked by a visitor whom he would support in the 2024 presidential race, Washington replied, \"I'm not sure what you mean by presidential race, sir. Do you mean the election? Race? Can you imagine how lacking of any sort of virtue or dignity a race would have? We stand for elections, sir; we certainly don't run for it!\"",
      "Ron Carnegie gives a striking portrayal of the man who could have been president for life, but chose a different path. \"Very often when I'm talking to people at the end, somebody in that group will say, 'I wish President Washington was running today,'\" Carnegie said. \"There's no way a man like President Washington could be president today.\"",
      "Because? \"He is aloof, he's not friendly, he's not outgoing, he doesn't like to talk in public. And he doesn't want the job. And how are you gonna become President today if you don't want the job?\"",
      "That wasn't a problem in 1800. John Adams very much wanted to keep the job; Thomas Jefferson wanted to take it.",
      "Smith noted, \"Things are just as nasty in the 18th century as they are in the 21st. There are newspapers that called John Adams pretty awful things. And there were terrible things thrown in Jefferson's corner. There were New Englanders and New England newspapers that were certain that if Jefferson was elected president, he would personally go into their homes and steal their Bibles.\"",
      "John Adams lost that election, and conceded. \"Jefferson calls that election of 1800 the Second American Revolution,\" said Smith. \"And it was precisely because, for the first time in this country, there was a change in political party at the very top of government, and it was peaceful. It was a peaceful transfer of power. That's powerful.\"",
      "That had never happened before, but it set a precedent that lasted \u2013 until our time.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 07:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Run for Recovery, a new program, offers a boot camp for people in recovery from substance use who dream of holding political office.",
    "story": [
      "Thomas Higdon was a politics fanatic his entire life: He kept up on the news cycle, he door-knocked for candidates, and he volunteered for a number of campaigns.",
      "He long dreamed of working in government, but he and everyone around him felt it wouldn't be possible because of his substance use. His use of alcohol and other drugs began causing problems when he was in law school in the mid-1990s, and in 2014, the consequences of his substance use left him living under an overpass. He is now abstinent from the drugs, but even years later, he felt he had ruined his chances of running for office.",
      "\"I allowed this internalized stigma, over decades, to blind me to what I could really do,\" Higdon, now 52, told CBS News.",
      "That thought stayed with him for years. He moved into grassroots organizing and advocacy spaces, but in 2023, he learned about the Recovery Advocacy Project's upcoming \"Run for Recovery\" program \u2014 and realized that working in public office might still be possible.",
      "Building a political bootcamp for people in recovery",
      "Courtney Gary-Allen, who began using drugs at a young age and overdosed multiple times before getting sober in 2015, has successfully run for office twice. In 2020, she was elected to the position of at-large City Councilor in Augusta, Maine. She was reelected to the same role in 2023. Both times, she won in a landslide, but the experience made her realize the need for a campaign bootcamp centered around people in recovery. Similar bootcamps are conducted by major political parties, but she wanted to create a bipartisan space tailored to the recovery community's specific experiences and needs.",
      "\"For the last decade or so, the recovery movement in America has been very focused on telling our stories and advocating and pushing for better policy around substance use disorder and recovery efforts, and I think this is a new chapter in the story of the recovery advocacy movement,\" said Gary-Allen, who is also the organizing director at the Maine Advocacy Recovery Project. \"We're no longer just advocating to policymakers. We are running for office to become the policymakers that are making decisions around these issues and many more.\"",
      "From that idea, Run for Recovery was born. The program graduated its inaugural class, made up of five Democrats, five Republicans, and five Independents, in August 2024. The 15 participants were selected from across the country. Once a month for a year, they met online to talk the ins and outs of mounting a campaign. Lessons ranged from learning about finance laws to drafting position statements to preparing to talk openly about their substance abuse.",
      "Higdon was one of the selected participants. Even though he had \"been around campaigns all (his) life,\" he said the Run for Recovery class educated him about the technicalities of running for office. But it wasn't just the classroom learning that inspired him. When he started the class, \"there was still that sort of nagging voice in the back of your head of 'You can't run,'\" Higdon said. The time with his classmates helped change his perspective.",
      "\"I just can't express how good it felt to be around people who also wanted to do this thing,\" Higdon said. \"There are a number of reasons why I ultimately may not run, but fear of what people will say and that stigma won't be one of them.\"",
      "Mobilize Recovery founder Ryan Hampton, who completed the Run for Recovery program and is campaigning for a seat in Nevada's state assembly, said that stigma has affected his campaign. He said his campaign has been subject to attack ads bringing up his history of substance use and calling his policy positions to a \"dangerous drug agenda.\"",
      "It's a stressful time, Hampton said, but lessons he's learned throughout his recovery journey and from the Run for Recovery program have helped him continue his campaign.",
      "\"I am certainly the underdog in this race, but I'm used to it,\" Hampton said. \"Am I afraid of losing an election? No, I have lost a lot more in my life than an election. I am not afraid of losing. I'm running to win, but I'm also running because I believe our community is yearning for something different.\"",
      "Growing a movement",
      "There's no compiled list of every single person in recovery running for office. Gary-Allen said she was aware of several people in recovery running for office in Maine. Higdon is weighing a run for a seat in Maryland's state legislature. Racquel Garcia, a Run for Recovery graduate who holds an appointed position in Colorado, is considering a campaign for a state position in 2026.",
      "Gary-Allen said she hopes to see more of the Run for Recovery program graduates start their own campaigns \u2014 and see others in recovery, even people who didn't go through the program, make the jump into politics.",
      "\"I think we're on this cusp of a revelation. Not only are people in recovery voting and showing up and advocating, we're running for office, and we're going to serve in these seats,\" Gary-Allen said. \"We're going to help create solutions to substance use across the country. I'm excited for the next couple of election seasons.\"",

      "Howard Bolton: Leslie never brought, uh, a Springfield \u2026 \u00a0let alone a Hellcat \u2014 to class.",
      "So then how did Reeves' DNA get on the guide rod of the murder weapon? Howard believes that Reeves' DNA could only be on that guide rod if the gun was fired at her at close range.",

      "Crime scene investigator Josh Easton told the jury what he'd observed inside the kitchen.",
      "Josh Easton: The refrigerator was pulled away from the wall from where it appeared it normally was.",
      "Prosecutors believe Reeves was trying to use the refrigerator to block the door. And based on where Smith was shot in his head, they think he was crouching down to help Reeves.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: I think that \u2026 while Chris was crouched down trying to hold the door shut, uh, Bobby shot through the door and struck Chris.",
      "With Smith incapacitated, Affrunti says Reeves hid in the living room. Tarr tracked her down, shot and killed her.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: I strongly believe that \u2026 he walked in and executed her.",
      "Defense attorney Dan Fultz disputes all of that.",
      "Dan Fultz: There is simply no evidence \u2026 that that's what happened. There's no evidence that Leslie pushed the refrigerator. There's no fingerprints and blood \u2026 on the refrigerator of Leslie's.",
      "Fultz says evidence of a fight in the kitchen tells a different story.",
      "Dan Fultz: The amount of blood in that kitchen was astonishing.",
      "Erin Moriarty: From looking at that crime scene, do you believe that Christopher Smith had to fight his -- his assailant \u2026 in the kitchen?",
      "Dan Fultz: It would appear to me that there was \u2026 some significant struggle in that kitchen between him and someone else.",
      "And he says the assailant could not have been Tarr because he would have been covered in blood.",
      "Dan Fultz: They did not identify a single piece of DNA in his car, they didn't identify a bloody fingerprint, they did not identify anything tying him to that crime scene.",
      "But prosecutors argued the house wasn't bloody when Tarr left. They said Chris bled heavily in the 12 hours it took for help to arrive. And while the prosecution did not have a lot of forensic evidence linking Tarr to the crime scene, Affrunti says his phone activity, his lies to investigators, and the evidence found on the Hellcat all prove his guilt.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: When you put all of that together, that's when you get the clear picture of what happened.",
      "When it was the defense's turn, Tarr says he wanted to tell his story to the jury. But he chose not to testify.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Why didn't you just decide you were gonna talk to the jury and tell this story, if in fact you have a story to tell?",
      "Bobby Tarr: I should have, I very well should have.",
      "Dan Fultz: We made a strategic decision \u2026 because it may have opened the door for a whole lot of other more damaging evidence to be used, to cross examine him.",
      "The defense didn't put on any witnesses and counted on the jury to find reasonable doubt in the lack of physical evidence. After three hours, the jury found Bobby Tarr guilty of first-degree murder and attempted murder.",
      "Two months later, Tarr was back in court for sentencing, and this time, so was Smith -- to tell the judge how the shooting impacted him and his family. Cameras were not allowed in the courtroom.",
      "Chris Smith (after sentencing) Lost my house, lost my truck \u2026 I mean, I've literally lost my life without being killed.",
      "While Smith was in a coma, he says looters descended on his house and stole his guitar and amps, even his above ground pool. Later, his house was sold at auction and then razed. All that's left is an empty lot.",
      "Tarr also spoke at his sentencing and denied shooting Reeves and Smith. The judge sentenced him to 85 years.",
      "Leslie Reeves' friends are focused on keeping her memory alive.",
      "Amy Steinhauer: I hope the rest of his time on this earth is hell.",
      "Howard Bolton: She was a light of a lot of people's lives. \u2026 She was always smiling. She was a very good mother, lived for her kids \u2026 And was an advocate and champion of women -- women's rights and especially women that were abused.",
      "Nanette Stuiber: If it can happen to her, it could happen to anyone. So we all need to be careful.",
      "Smith says he never expected he'd be a victim of domestic violence and cautions other men to take a hard look at their behavior.",
      "Chris Smith: If guys you feel like that, if you wanna hurt a woman, get help.",
      "While Smith mourns his old life, he is writing a book about his experiences, and says he's working to make what he calls poor man's margaritas out of the lemons and limes he's been handed.",
      "Chris Smith: I've got a do-over. Good Lord gimme a do-over. Not many people get a second chance in life.",
      "Smith has found love with Michelle Albrecht.",
      "Chris Smith: She's an angel. \u2026 Loving me and accepting me the way that I am.",
      "He proposed to her on stage.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What's the most important lesson out of all of this?",
      "Chris Smith: Don't ever give up on anything ever, ever\u2026 No matter how bad things are. Don't ever give up.",
      "Leslie Reeves' two children are being raised by their father.",
      "Bobby Tarr is still awaiting trial on solicitation of murder charges.",
