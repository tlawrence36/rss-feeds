      "NEW YORK -- After more than 11 months and hundreds of singalongs, \u201cMy Girl\u201d finally has some company atop the charts at Citi Field.",
      "New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor, whose pivot to The Temptations\u2019 \u201cMy Girl\u201d as his walk-up song last May coincided with a turnaround in fortunes for Lindor and his teammates, added \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough\u201d \u2014 the 1967 duet by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell \u2014 to his rotation prior to his second at-bat in Friday's 7-2 win over the Chicago Cubs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the vibes \u2014 the vibes I\u2019m in right now,\u201d Lindor said with a grin Friday night. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fantastic song. Hopefully the fans can vibe to it, too.\u201d",
      "Lindor\u2019s success with \u201cMy Girl\u201d and the accompanying pop culture sensation made his pivot a surprise to the 41,243 fans in attendance Friday, if not his teammates.",
      "Lindor was batting .210 and the Mets were 22-30 when he debuted \u201cMy Girl\u201d last May 28, but Lindor hit .306 the rest of the way and finished second in NL MVP balloting as New York made it to the National League Championship Series. The Temptations performed the song, along with the national anthem, prior to Game 5 of the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Lindor hit a leadoff homer for the first-place Mets on Friday \u2014 his 34th round-tripper in 137 games since introducing \u201cMy Girl.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere were some fans that yelled at me,\u201d Lindor said. \u201cBut there were some other ones that were singing.\u201d",
      "Mets first baseman Pete Alonso, who is walking up to Eric Clapton\u2019s \u201cLayla\u201d this year after using Rush\u2019s \u201cWorking Man\u201d and Don McLean\u2019s \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d in previous seasons, said Lindor hinted at the change during the just-concluded road trip to St. Louis and Arizona.",
      "\u201cHe said he was going to do it and no one believed him,\u201d Alonso said Saturday. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good one \u2014 that\u2019s a great walk-up song.\u201d",
      "Lindor acknowledged some teammates wanted him to stick with \u201cMy Girl\u201d and said he\u2019d alternate the songs in hopes his new selection grows in popularity.",
      "\u201cMan, the movie \u2018Remember The Titans\u2019 \u2014 who doesn\u2019t know that?\u201d Lindor said, referring to the song\u2019s usage in the 2000 film. \u201cIt\u2019s a great song. So we\u2019ll see if it catches on. If it doesn\u2019t catch on \u2014 since I got pushback from some people \u2014 they\u2019re still going to get \u2018My Girl.\u2019\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's lawyers sought Friday to raise doubts about a former model's allegations that he repeatedly sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.",
      "As defense lawyer Mike Cibella began what's likely to be lengthy questioning of Kaja Sokola, he pointed to differences in some details of her testimony this week and what she told a grand jury last year.",
      "Cibella also noted that although documents have indicated that Weinstein and Sokola knew each other by 2006, no witnesses or documents corroborate her account of meeting the then-influential movie producer four years earlier at a Manhattan nightclub. She was 16 at the time and alleges he first sexually assaulted her days after they met.",
      "Sokola is the second of three accusers to testify at Weinstein's rape and sexual assault retrial, and she's the only one who wasn\u2019t part of the onetime Hollywood honcho\u2019s first trial in 2020.",
      "Weinstein is being retried because an appeals court overturned his landmark #MeToo 2020 conviction, saying the judge at the time allowed prejudicial testimony. After the reversal, prosecutors added Sokola\u2019s allegation to the case.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies ever sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "The Polish-born Sokola, 39, is a psychotherapist who had a jet-setting modeling career as a teen. She testified earlier this week that Weinstein exploited her youthful interest in an acting career to subject her to unwanted sexual advances, starting days after they met in 2002, while she was on a modeling trip to New York.",
      "Another alleged incident, in 2006, is the basis for a criminal sex act charge against Weinstein. Sokola, who was 19 at the time, says he lured her to a hotel room by saying he had a script for her to see, then pinned her down on a bed and performed oral sex on her as she implored him not to.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted, but Haley, Mann and Sokola have given their permission to be identified.",

      "NEW YORK -- Historian Ron Chernow's latest work may surprise readers who know him best for the book which inspired the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and for his biographies of George Washington and Ulysses Grant.",
      "The 1,200-page \u201cMark Twain\u201d will be published next week. It's Chernow's first release since his Grant biography came out in 2017, and the first time he has taken on a literary writer after a career defined by celebrated books about business leaders (John D. Rockefeller, the Morgan dynasty), presidents (Grant and Washington) and, most of all, Alexander Hamilton. His many honors include the Pulitzer Prize for \u201cWashington: A Life,\u201d the National Book Award for \u201cThe House of Morgan\u201d and the National Book Critics Circle prize for \u201cTitan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.\u201d",
      "But a book on Twain had been in his thoughts for decades, dating back to when he saw Hal Holbrook play him on stage in Philadelphia in the mid-1970s.",
      "\u201cAnd there he was, with the white suit and cigar and mustache and he was tossing out one hilarious line after another,\u201d the 76-year-old Chernow says, remembering such Twain quips as \u201cThere's no distinctly Native American criminal class, except Congress.\u201d Chernow became fascinated by Twain as a prototype of the modern celebrity and found himself drawn less to \u201cMark Twain the novelist than the pundit, the personality and the platform artist.\u201d",
      "Chernow admittedly is more comfortable with the researchable world of facts than with the more intangible qualities of the imagination. But he found much to identify with Twain, relating to him as a fellow widower (Twain outlived his wife, Olivia, by six years; Chernow's wife, Valerie Stearn, died in 2006), as a public speaker and as an author fortunate enough to write full time.",
      "Chernow also looks closely into subjects familiar to him \u2014 politics and finance, notably the various failed business ventures that left Twain short of money despite his author royalties and the inherited wealth of his wife. Toward the end of the book, the historian addresses the friendships an elderly Twain cultivated with teen and preteen girls, whom Twain called his \u201cangelfish.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the time Twain\u2019s behavior was regarded as the charming eccentricity of a beloved humorist with a soft spot for children. We look at that same behavior today and find it odd and disturbing. It's important to get both perspectives,\u201d Chernow says. \u201cTwain\u2019s behavior was chaste and none of the angelfish or their parents ever accused him of improper or predatory behavior. At the same time, there was such an obsessive quality about Twain\u2019s attention to these teenage girls \u2014 he devoted more time to them than to his own daughters.\u201d",
      "During a recent interview at his Upper West Side Manhattan apartment, where his glass of Diet Coke stood on a coaster illustrated with a sketch of Twain receiving an honorary college degree, Chernow also reflected on Twain's family, his politics and the sadness in his soul. Chernow's comments have been condensed for clarity and brevity.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know what he would say about Donald Trump. I could, yes, but I don\u2019t want to guess. But we do know what he said about political figures of his own day. And he hated Teddy Roosevelt. He saw that Teddy Roosevelt had a very large ego, very self-absorbed and a Mr. Bombastic personality. But he (Twain) has a wonderful quote where he says that Teddy Roosevelt is the Tom Sawyer of the political world of the early 20th century. He said that he was always hunting for attention. And then he has this great line. He said that in his (Roosevelt's) frenzied imagination, the great republic is one vast Barnum\u2019s circus, and he is the clown, and the whole world is his audience.\u201d",
      "To actually read about the children of famous personalities is almost invariably sad, as it often is with Mark Twain. The one who suffered from this most acutely, I think was the middle daughter, Clara, who was kind of insanely competitive with her father and felt overshadowed by him, wanted to kind of trade on his reputation, but then didn\u2019t want him to get the attention. She said that she would be in a room with her father, and she felt she was only Mark Twain\u2019s daughter, that she was reduced to the level of a footstool. And she also had a very interesting line, one that has a very contemporary ring: He would come into the room and he would flood the room with talk.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere's that time when he goes to the Sandwich Islands and he meets the American diplomat Anson Burlingame, who advises him to \u201ccultivate your betters,\u201d which Twain really takes to heart. I think that with Twain, if someone asks me, you know, did he marry Olivia for her money? I would say definitely not. It was a true love match. And as Twain said late in life, there was not a single day of his marriage that she didn\u2019t say, \u2018I worship you,\u2019 \u2018I idolize you.\u2019 This was just kind of pouring out of her and her letters. On the other hand, the more you know about Mark Twain, the more you know that he could never have married a poor woman.",
      "\u201cAnd the irony of Twain\u2019s life is that he spends his entire life attacking the plutocrats on the one hand, and on the other, he\u2019s doing everything in his power to become one. This man embodies in his person every tendency of the time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of self-loathing in him. I have a quote later in the book \u2014 he says that (poet Lord) Byron detested life because he detested himself. Twain said, \u2018I\u2019m the same way.\u2019 You know, that's a really harsh, harsh thing to say. But I think that he saw all these impulses within himself that he was really powerless to stop. And then he realized he hurt other people. I think that Mark Twain did fit the stereotype of the funny man who\u2019s sad and depressed under the surface and is kind of releasing that through the humor.\u201d",

      "In 1976, De Niro starred in two films \u2014 Martin Scorsese's \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and Bernardo Bertolucci's \u201c1900\" \u2014 that premiered in competition at Cannes. \u201cTaxi Driver\" was an immediate sensation, and went home with the festival's top prize, the Palme d'Or.",
      "Since then, De Niro has been a regular on the Croisette, returning with \u201cThe King of Comedy\u201d in 1983, Sergio Leone's \u201cOnce Upon a Time in America\u201d in 1984 and Roland Joff\u00e9's \u201cThe Mission\u201d in 1986. Joff\u00e9's film also won the Palme, making De Niro the rare actor to star in two Palme d'Or winners.",
      "Though De Niro helps run his own film festival back in New York, the Tribeca Festival, he has remained a mainstay in Cannes. He presided over the jury in 2011 that selected Terrence Malick's \u201cThe Tree of Life\u201d for the Palme. Most recently, he and Scorsese returned to premiere \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d in 2023.",
      "\u201cI have such close feelings for Festival de Cannes,\" De Niro said when his honorary Palme d'Or was announced last month. \u201cEspecially now when there\u2019s so much in the world pulling us apart, Cannes brings us together \u2014 storytellers, filmmakers, fans, and friends. It\u2019s like coming home.\u201d",

      "The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been postponed until early next week",
      "NEW YORK -- The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was postponed until early next week, right before opening arguments begin, a federal judge decided on Friday.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Combs, 55, used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024. He pleaded not guilty after his September arrest and has remained held without bail at a federal lockup in Brooklyn.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian granted the defense lawyers' request to delay the last step in jury selection until Monday, when both sides will narrow down the pool of 45 people to 12 jurors and six alternates. Generally, lawyers do not have to explain why they are ejecting individuals from the panel.",
      "The defense said striking prospective jurors could take as little as 10 to 15 minutes, so why not do it on Monday when they will be present. The jurors weren\u2019t required to be in the Manhattan courtroom on Friday, but Combs was there.",
      "Prosecutors objected, saying the whole process could get gummed up if several jurors panic after being chosen and decide they don\u2019t want to take part in a high-profile trial that's expected to last two months.",
      "Would-be jurors were asked questions earlier this week to help the judge and lawyers determine if they could be fair and impartial. And they were also questioned to ensure they could decide the case on the facts \u2014 even after seeing explicit videos of sexual activity that some might find disturbing.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors will be permitted to strike six prospective jurors from the jury while defense lawyers were allowed 10 strikes before the jury is finalized. The process is expected to take up to an hour.",
      "If Combs is convicted on all charges, which include racketeering, kidnapping, arson, bribery and sex trafficking, he would face a mandatory 15 years in prison and could remain behind bars for life.",
      "Prosecutors allege the Bad Boy Records founder used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024.",
      "An indictment includes descriptions of \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d drugged-up orgies in which women were forced to have sex with male sex workers while Combs filmed them.",
      "The charges against him also portray Combs as abusive to his victims, sometimes choking, hitting, kicking and dragging them, often by the hair. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "His lawyers say prosecutors are trying to criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults. They concede that Combs had abused various substances but say he has undergone treatment.",
      "A centerpiece of the evidence against him are recordings of Combs beating a longtime girlfriend in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016.",
      "After a video of the encounter aired on CNN last year, Combs apologized, saying, \u201cI take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u2019m disgusted now.\u201d",
      "Numerous prospective jurors told the judge they'd seen the video and some were deemed too affected by it to be impartial.",

      "A judge has ordered a man who authorities say crashed his car through the front gate of Jennifer Aniston\u2019s home to face a competency review",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge on Thursday ordered that a man who authorities say crashed his car through the front gate of Jennifer Aniston's home must go through mental-health court to determine whether he is competent to face felony stalking and vandalism charges.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, 48, appeared shirtless and wrapped in a blanket when he appeared behind glass in a custody area of a Los Angeles courtroom. Carwyle did not speak during the proceedings; his attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf.",
      "Prosecutors say the Mississippi man had been harassing Aniston with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving into her gate on Monday.",
      "Judge Keith L. Schwartz doubted whether Carwyle would understand him when a prosecutor requested that the defendant, who will remain in jail, be ordered not to get near Aniston.",
      "Carwyle's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Toral Malik, said \u201cI don\u2019t believe him staying away from Ms. Aniston will be an issue at this time.\"",
      "But at a prosecutors' insistence, Schwartz issued the order anyway.",
      "\u201cYou are not to have any contact with Jennifer Aniston under any conditions,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Authorities say Aniston was home when Carwyle crashed his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood, causing major damage, prosecutors said. A security guard stopped him in her driveway before police arrived and arrested him.",
      "There were no reports of anyone being injured.",
      "An Aniston attorney who attended Thursday's hearing declined comment, and other representatives of the \u201cFriends\u201d star have not responded to comment requests.",
      "Carwyle also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm. If convicted he could get up to three years in prison.",
      "Malik not speak to reporters outside court.",
      "Aniston bought the midcentury mansion on a 3.4-acre lot for about $21 million in 2012, according to reporting by Architectural Digest.",
      "She became one of the biggest stars in television in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends.\u201d Aniston won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

      "A former model has testified that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, calling it the most \u201chorrifying thing I ever experienced\u201d to that point",
      "NEW YORK -- A former model tearfully testified Thursday that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, calling it the most \u201chorrifying thing I ever experienced\u201d to that point.",
      "Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola, an aspiring actor at the time, told jurors at Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial that the onetime movie honcho put his hand inside her underwear and made her touch his genitals at a Manhattan apartment in 2002.",
      "Sokola said she saw Weinstein\u2019s eyes \u2014 \u201cblack and scary\u201d \u2014 staring at her in a bathroom mirror as it happened.",
      "Afterward, she said, he told her to keep quiet about what had happened, touting that he'd made the careers of A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and that he could help her Hollywood dreams come true.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never been in a situation like this,\u201d Sokola testified, as riveted jurors scribbled notes. \u201cI felt stupid and ashamed and like it\u2019s my fault for putting myself in this position.\u201d",
      "Weinstein is not charged with any crime in connection with the alleged assault, which Sokola first detailed in a lawsuit a few years ago. The timing put it outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges.",
      "Sokola is testifying because Weinstein is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel four years later, around the time of her 20th birthday. Prosecutors say it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries.\u201d",
      "Sokola reported the allegation to authorities a few days into Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020, but was not a part of that case. Prosecutors added her to the retrial, joining two women who testified in the first case, after his conviction was overturned last year.",
      "Weinstein, now 73, looked down and away from Sokola as she recounted the earlier allegation, pressing his left thumb and index finger against his face like a shield.",
      "Sokola testified that she first met the then-studio boss at a Manhattan restaurant in 2002, three or four days before the alleged assault. During the short chat, she said, Weinstein asked her if she wanted to be an actress.",
      "A few days later, she said, he invited her to lunch \u2014 ostensibly to talk about acting \u2014 but instead took her to an apartment, where led her into a bedroom and then a bathroom, instructed her to take her top off and assaulted her.",
      "\u201cHe told me to talk my clothes off and I didn\u2019t want to do that. I was panicking,\u201d Sokola testified. \u201cAnd then he said that if I want to be an actress, that\u2019s what actors do in films, so I should get used to it. If a director says you have you take your clothes off, you have to take your clothes off. I was scared. I was scared of him.\u201d",
      "Sokola avoided looking at Weinstein as she walked to the witness stand \u2014 testifying for a second day after detailing on Wednesday her upbringing in Poland, entr\u00e9e into modeling and her professional career as a psychotherapist and author who recently launched a film production company. She peered briefly at Weinstein when asked Thursday to point him out in court.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults. The women, meanwhile, say the then-producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "Sokola sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "Prosecutors have said they began investigating Sokola\u2019s claims in 2020 but set the inquiry aside after Weinstein was convicted. They revived the investigation after New York\u2019s highest court reversed his conviction.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola out of the retrial, accusing prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case\u201d to try to bolster other accusers\u2019 credibility.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

      "The band, which by the 1970s had become one of the world\u2019s biggest touring bands, easily filling the largest U.S. stadiums, will play their first gig in Florida on Aug. 16, with further dates in cities including New York, Toronto, Los Angeles and Vancouver, before a final date in Las Vegas on Sept. 28.",
      "\u201cEvery musician\u2019s dream in the early '60s was to make it big in the U.S. charts,\" Daltrey said. \u201cFor The Who, that dream came true in 1967 and our lives were changed forever.\u201d",
      "The band went from performing club shows to headlining the Woodstock festival in the U.S. and becoming one of the biggest box-office draw in the world. The band were inducted into the Rock n\u2019 Roll Hall Of Fame in 1990.",
      "Daltrey, 81, and Townshend, two years his junior, have been one of rock's most prolific double acts, surviving the deaths of drummer Keith Moon in 1978 and bass guitarist John Entwistle in 2002.",
      "\u201cToday, Roger and I still carry the banner for the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle, and, of course, all of our long-time Who fans,\" Townshend said. \u201cI must say that although the road has not always been enjoyable for me, it is usually easy: the best job I could ever have had. I keep coming back.\u201d",
      "Though Daltrey didn\u2019t write songs, he was able to channel Townsend\u2019s many and complicated moods \u2014 defiance and rage, vulnerability and desperation.",
      "Together, they forged some of rock\u2019s most defining sounds: the stuttering, sneering delivery of \u201cMy Generation,\u201d the anguished cry of \u201cThey\u2019re all wasted!\u201d from \u201cBaba O\u2019Reilly,\u201d and the all-time scream from \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again.\u201d",
      "Pre-sales will run from May 13 ahead of the general sale beginning May 16.",
      "\u201cWell, all good things must come to an end. It is a poignant time,\" Townshend said. \u201cFor me, playing to American audiences and those in Canada has always been incredible.\u201d",

      "Kali Uchis wrote the album that she knew her future self would need to listen to",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kali Uchis wrote the album she knew her future self would need to listen to. The Grammy-winning artist unknowingly was crafting her own audible remedy.",
      "\u201cI really did make the music that I needed for my grieving process, for just the place that I\u2019m at in my life right now,\u201d she says of the album out Friday.",
      "\u201cSincerely,\u201d (yes, the title includes the comma) began as a collection of letters to herself, friends and loved ones but took on a deeper meaning as the Colombian American songwriter gave birth to her first child and processed her mother's recent death. The first single, \u201cSunshine & Rain...,\u201d includes a clip of Uchis' mother saying, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to immortalize her in the project,\u201d said Uchis. \u201cI thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album.\u201d",
      "The 14-track album finds Uchis proudly wearing her heart on her sleeve with songs like \u201cDaggers!,\u201d where Uchis encourages a close friend to lean into self-love, or \u201cILYSMIH,\u201d which includes baby coos at the beginning and was written as she lay in her hospital bed with her newborn.",
      "Uchis hopes that after listening to her fifth full album, fans will feel more connected to themselves and more in touch with their emotions: \u201cI hope it will give them some type of solace.\"",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "UCHIS: I\u2019m a very deep feeler. I\u2019m very empathetic. I feel a lot. And I wanted to make a body of work that fully showed that vulnerability and that actually really dug deep into my heart in a way that none of my other albums ever had.",
      "I felt like I was ready to do that because I\u2019ve been making music long enough that I felt that it was that time for me, and then it just so happened that, shortly after working on the album, I became pregnant, which was such a big part of being able to feel even deeper than I ever have.",
      "UCHIS: It\u2019s crazy because a lot of times I feel, and especially with this album in particular, I felt that I really made music that my future self would need, that I didn\u2019t realize I was going to need at that time.",
      "The album is actually dedicated to my mom. My mom later ended up getting diagnosed, and she\u2019s no longer here. ... And so pretty much all of the songs ended up taking on a deeper meaning to me because of that and because of it being dedicated to her. ... At the time, I might not have even realized subconsciously that I was making all of this to heal myself.",
      "UCHIS: At one point, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make sure each of these songs is like, this is my letter to the world, this is my letter to this person, this my letter to that, this one to myself.\u201d I tried to really conceptualize in a different way that I never have when making any other album. And then ... when my mom passed, a lot of what I had left from her is letters that she wrote to me, and so it ended up, like I said, just more and more reasons for me to realize that it was the correct title for the project.",
      "UCHIS: I never stick to one process, but one particular process that stuck out to me on a lot of the songs was that most of them were written with no music, just songs that came to me.",
      "For instance, \u201cILYSMIH\u201d \u2014 that one literally I was just recovering from labor, my son was sleeping next to me; I was still in my hospital bed when I got this idea for this song and started it, started recording it on my phone, started writing some lyrics down. ... There\u2019s one called \u201cAll I Can Say.\u201d I wrote that whole song in the car on the way to the studio. ... I try to just make beauty out of all of my experiences.",
      "UCHIS: Thematically, nature is kind of a reoccurring theme in my music because I am so inspired by nature and I feel nature is where God exists and nature is where a lot of my creativity just thrives.",
      "I feel like it just happened. Afterwards, I even thought, \u201cIs this too similar to what I\u2019ve already done?\u201d But \u2026 I just love the things that I love, and I just returned back to those nostalgic elements. I may branch out and try what people think is different sounds. Like on \u201cOrqu\u00eddeas,\u201d I did a lot of different genre-bending on \u201cSin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)\" as well, but to me, that\u2019s still nostalgic because it\u2019s still music I grew up listening to.",
      "I return a lot to things that are core memories for me. It\u2019s soothing to my nervous system. I\u2019m the person who watches the same episodes of my favorite TV shows over and over again, ... I think that\u2019s what makes it beautiful too, is to see the evolution and know that it\u2019s still true to me. It's still true to my roots in music and where I started, but an evolved version.",
      "UCHIS: After she passed, one of the first things I did was go through all of the audio messages that she had ever sent me and I was just listening to all her messages over and over, wanting to hear her voice. When I heard that one I just thought of, \u201cOh how perfect is this that the song is called \u2018Sunshine &Rain...,\u2019 and she had said, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d It was for my son that she sent that message. I thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album, considering that it\u2019s dedicated to her.",
      "I struggled a lot with whether or not I wanted to share because I\u2019m a very, very private person. So I struggled a lot with if I even wanted to share that my mom was no longer here, but I felt I just had to not be afraid of that vulnerability and not pretend like it didn\u2019t affect me or didn\u2019t have some type of impact on me when it had such a big impact on me and still does. And I wanted to also honor her and honor her life in a way through art that I know that she would have loved and that she would have been proud of.",

      "A scrappy opera company that started 11 years ago in New York City is thriving by staying small",
      "NEW YORK -- Dan Schlosberg remembers the day 11 years ago when his upstart opera company put on its first performance \u2014 in a yoga studio before an audience of 30 people.",
      "\u201cWe did Kurt Weill\u2019s \u2018The Seven Deadly Sins\u2019 accompanied by an upright piano that we got for free on Craigslist and a violin,\u201d recalled Schlosberg, the company\u2019s music director and one of its founders.",
      "They named their company Heartbeat Opera, \u201cfrom the idea that singers would be feet away from you,\u201d Schlosberg said. \u201cAnd so you would be experiencing their voices at arm\u2019s length and that would make a resonance in your heart.\u201d",
      "Today, in an era when many opera companies are struggling financially, Heartbeat appears to be thriving, with an annual budget that just passed $1 million.",
      "But true to its initial vision, the company still performs in small venues, most with a seating capacity of about 200.",
      "\u201cVery few small companies take up the ambition to do the fullness of opera on a small scale,\u201d said Jacob Ashworth, another founding member and Heartbeat\u2019s artistic director. \u201cWe don\u2019t do small opera. We do big opera in a small space.\u201d",
      "And despite its success with critics and audiences \u2014 performances regularly sell out \u2014 the company has deliberately maintained a modest schedule.",
      "There\u2019s typically an opera-themed drag show around Halloween and then two operas staged in New York City performance spaces in the winter and spring. Each work is condensed to 90-100 intermission-less minutes with new orchestrations that require just a few musicians.",
      "Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, thinks Heartbeat is smart not to expand too quickly \u2014 a mistake that has caused some small companies to collapse.",
      "\u201cGrowth itself shouldn\u2019t be a goal. Excellence should be a goal,\u201d he said. \u201cI always prefer companies to plan their trajectory as slow as possible so they don\u2019t overstretch and overstep.\u201d",
      "Unlike some small companies, Heartbeat doesn\u2019t focus on new work or on bringing to light neglected old rarities. Instead, its website promises \u201cincisive adaptations and revelatory arrangements of classics, reimagining them for the here and now.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that reimagining that attracted Sara Holdren, a director, writer and teacher who first worked with the company on Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d in 2017.",
      "\u201cTheir approaches to the storytelling feel extremely of our world and about our world,\u201d she said, \u201cwithout falling across that line into a sort of trite topicality where you say, \u2018Oh yes, I understand a relevant-with-a-capital-R political point is being made here\u2019.\u201d",
      "For Beethoven\u2019s \u201cFidelio,\u201d Heartbeat went to prisons and recorded the voices of incarcerated people, who appeared on video singing the Prisoners Chorus. For Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cEugene Onegin,\u201d the two main male characters became lovers, reflecting the composer\u2019s own sexuality.",
      "And for Richard Strauss\u2019 \u201cSalome\u201d this season, the teenage title character was dressed in a frilly pink skirt and sneakers; John the Baptist was imprisoned on stage in a cage with transparent sides instead of in an underground cistern; and during the Dance of the Seven Veils, it was a lascivious Herod who stripped off his clothes, not Salome.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s casting for \u201cSalome\u201d reflected the premium it places on theatrical values in addition to vocal ability.",
      "Baritone Nathaniel Sullivan, who portrayed John the Baptist, recalled that \u201ca big part of the audition was just straight acting. And in the rehearsals, there was a real focus on the storytelling.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t experienced that in a lot of other opera companies to that extent,\u201d he said.",
      "Soprano Summer Hassan, who was cast as Salome, admits she was nervous at first \u201cbecause I had never done a role like this where I am the title character.",
      "\u201cI was really doubting myself, thinking how do I make this girl look so young?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they said, your physicality will do that on your own. Make her look confident and you will make her look like a confident child. They gave me the tools to figure out it was within me.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most striking aspect of this \u201cSalome\u201d was the re-orchestration by Schlosberg. Instead of more than 100 players as called for in the original, he took a cue from the opening notes on a clarinet and scored the piece for eight clarinetists (who also played other instruments) and two percussionists.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s final local offering of the season will be Gounod\u2019s \u201cFaust,\u201d to run at the Baruch Performing Arts Center from May 13-25.",
      "\u201cI had mentioned to Jacob that I really love devil stories,\u201d said Holdren, who is directing the production. \u201cAnd I was fascinated with the idea of taking something so big and so weighed down with history and assumptions and seeing how much we could crack it open and blow the dust off.\u201d",
      "She sees Mephistopheles less as a \u201dmustache-twirling villain\u201d and more as \u201ca figure of hunger and loneliness slipping into the vacuums that human beings create when they are so desperate or disgusted with life that there\u2019s an opening for him.\u201d",
      "Her production will be set in contemporary times, sung in French but with new English-language dialogue, and it will make heavy use of shadow puppetry. It\u2019s the first Heartbeat offering for which Schlosberg has not done the re-orchestration.",
      "That task fell to Francisco Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara, a Mexican violinist and composer who has scored the opera for seven musicians, most of whom play two instruments, including Ashworth, who will play violin and mandolin and also conduct.",
      "Schlosberg will be back doing the arranging for a rare Heartbeat foray outside the city this summer. The company has been invited to stage a revised version of Samuel Barber\u2019s \u201cVanessa\u201d at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really excited by what they\u2019ve been doing, particularly in reimagining the classics for contemporary times,\" said Raphael Picciarelli, co-managing director of the festival.",
      "For Heartbeat\u2019s debut in Williamstown, the festival is setting up a new performance space that should make the company feel right at home. It\u2019s in an abandoned grocery store, and there will be seats for just over 200 people.",

      "Smokey Robinson\u2019s lawyer says allegations of rape and sexual assault against him in a lawsuit from four former housekeepers are \u201cvile\u201d and \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Smokey Robinson's lawyer said allegations of rape and sexual assault against him in a lawsuit from four former housekeepers are \u201cvile\" and \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "Attorney Christopher Frost said in a statement Wednesday that the evidence \u201cwill show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.\u201d",
      "The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday against the Motown music luminary seeks at least $50 million in damages over the alleged assaults, which the women say took place between 2007 and 2024. Robinson's wife, Frances Robinson, is also named as a defendant for allegedly enabling his behavior and creating an abusive work environment.",
      "\u201cWe will be addressing the numerous aspects of the complaint that defy credulity as well as issues relating to purported timelines, inconsistencies, and relationships between the plaintiffs and others,\u201d Frost's statement said.",
      "The four women each allege that Smokey Robinson would wait until he was alone with them in his Los Angeles house and then sexually assault and rape them over their objections, in some cases for many years.",
      "\u201cWe believe that Mr. Robinson is a serial and sick rapist, and must be stopped,\u201d the women\u2019s attorney John Harris said at a news conference Tuesday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. The women, whose names are withheld in the lawsuit, appeared with their lawyers at the news conference. They didn't speak, and they covered their faces with masks.",
      "Frost called the news conference \u201cbizarre theatrics,\u201d and an attempt to \u201cenlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create. We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold.\u201d",
      "One woman said that she worked for Robinson from 2012 until 2024, and was assaulted at least 20 times in that span. Another said that she worked for him from 2014 until 2020, and was assaulted at least 23 times.",
      "All of the accusers said they eventually quit over the assaults, though in some cases it took several years. And all said they feared coming forward over fears of retaliation, public shame and possible effects on their immigration status. The same fears have kept the women from going to police to report Robinson, their lawyers said, though they also said they believe criminal investigation is warranted.",
      "The suit seeks damages based on sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence and other allegations.",
      "Frost said that Robinson would soon address the allegations himself, and that they would be asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Robinson, a member of both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was among the biggest hitmakers of the 1960s as a central part of the Motown Records machine \u2014 both with his group the Miracles and as a solo artist, with songs including \u201cTears of a Clown\" and \u201cThe Tracks of My Tears.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former model who alleges that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her almost 20 years ago has taken the stand at his retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- Days into Harvey Weinstein 's first sexual assault trial in 2020, prosecutors privately spoke for the first time with a former model who alleged that he had forced oral sex on her.",
      "But that jury was never told about Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola's claim. Prosecutors have said they still were investigating the allegation when Weinstein, a onetime movie tycoon-turned- #MeToo pariah, was convicted in February 2020 of charges based on other women's accusations.",
      "On Wednesday, Sokola began to tell a new jury her story.",
      "Sokola didn't look at Weinstein as she walked past him and onto the witness stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he's on trial again. An appeals court overturned his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction, sending those charges back for retrial, and prosecutors subsequently added another sexual assault charge based on Sokola's allegations.",
      "As she began testifying about her life before the alleged 2006 assault, Weinstein looked toward her, with his right hand across his mouth.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults.",
      "The women, meanwhile, say the Oscar-winning producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "The Polish-born Sokola, 39, sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and its calls for accountability for sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "She was introduced to Weinstein while on a modeling trip to New York in 2002, when she was 16, according to prosecutors.",
      "In her lawsuits, Sokola said that shortly after she met Weinstein, he invited her to lunch to discuss her career but then sexually assaulted her. The lawsuits alleged he sexually harassed and emotionally abused her for years afterward.",
      "The criminal charge stems from one instance when Sokola maintains that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in May 2006.",
      "Prosecutors have said it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries\u201d and met her visiting older sister, whom she was trying to impress.",
      "\u201cShe was proud of knowing him,\u201d her sister, cardiologist Dr. Ewa (pronounced EH\u2019-vah) Sokola, told jurors Wednesday.",
      "She said the three of them met in a hotel lobby, chatted for about an hour about Italian movies and the heavyset Weinstein's heart health, and then he and the model left the table together.",
      "Kaja Sokola was tense when she returned about a half-hour later \u2014 \u201clike somebody waiting for the result of an exam\u201d or the Oscars \u2014 but didn't say anything about the alleged sexual assault, Dr. Sokola told jurors.",
      "She said she was shocked to learn about the claim over a decade later, when she read about it in a magazine article.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers will get a chance to question Kaja Sokola in the coming days. In an opening statement last month, defense attorney Arthur Aidala questioned why she waited years to come forward. Prosecutors have argued that accusers were reluctant to speak up because of Weinstein's wealth and influence.",
      "Prosecutors have said Sokola's attorneys contacted them on the eve of Weinstein's first trial to say she was willing to be interviewed. Prosecutors have said they soon spoke with her and began investigating, but didn't initially pursue charges because Weinstein was convicted and the coronavirus pandemic loomed.",
      "They revived the Sokola investigation after New York's highest court reversed Weinstein's conviction.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola's allegation out of the retrial. They accused prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case for the improper purpose of bolstering the credibility\u201d of other accusers.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

      "Kelce \u2014 who retired following the 2023 season after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles, played his role as man of the people to perfection during a pro-am ahead of the Truist Championship. He took time to answer questions from 14-year-old Benji Panzer, a middle school student who had credentials as part of an area sports broadcasting camp.

      "Pitt, 44, whose lawyers denied the allegations, was arrested Friday on nine counts including first-degree sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, attempted assault and strangulation. The indictment cites four incidents between April 2020 and August 2021 at Pitt's home in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.",
      "Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez's office declined to comment Wednesday beyond the allegations listed in the indictment.",

      "Pitt pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday and posted $100,000 bail, Goldman said. He is due back in court in Brooklyn on June 17.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, which the woman in Pitt's case has not done.",
      "The indictment alleges Pitt forcibly touched his ex-girlfriend sexually in April 2020. In August 2020, the grand jury alleges Pitt forced oral sex on the woman and assaulted her with a 4-inch-by-4-inch (10-centimeter-by-10-centimeter) piece of lumber.",
      "The indictment also says Pitt attacked her with a cinder block twice in June 2021 and choked her in August 2021.",

      "The company's 2025 season has 25 staged performances of four works, including the world premiere on May 31 of Ricky Ian Gordon's \u201cThis House,\u201d with a libretto by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage and her daughter, Ruby Aiyo Gerber. The company projects its operating budget at $12.5 million to $13 million.",
      "Racette, who turns 60 next month, made her directing debut in St. Louis with Verdi's \u201cLa Traviata\u201d in 2018 and went on to direct in Poulenc's \u201cLa Voix Humaine\u201d in 2021 and Carlisle Floyd's \u201cSusannah\u201d in 2023.",
      "\u201cHaving lived my life on stage and now as a director, I\u2019ve been on both sides of the curtain,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that puts me in a unique position to understand what goes into putting on an opera.\u201d",
      "Racette is to sing in Polenc's \u201cDialogues des Carm\u00e9lites\u201d at The Dallas Opera in November and to direct her \u201cSusannah\u201d at Opera Omaha in January. She will work in St. Louis with an administration that includes principal conductor Daniela Candillari and already has been involved in future programming.",
      "\u201cAs she's added master teacher, as she's added mentor, as she has become a stage director, as she has taken a greater role in casting here,\u201d Jorgensen said, \u201cshe has proven just time and again that all of those skills that made her such a spectacular performer, she now understands how to how to bring all of that, harness it and leverage it for the broader benefit of the organization.\u201d",

      "Jury selection is set to start in Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs' sex trafficking trial in New York",
      "NEW YORK -- Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, the hip-hop entrepreneur whose wildly successful career has been dotted by allegations of violence, will be brought to a New York courthouse Monday to be tried on charges that he used the influence and resources of his business empire to sexually abuse women. Jury selection is scheduled to begin in the morning and potentially take several days. Opening statements by the lawyers and the start of testimony is expected next week.",
      "The 17-page indictment against Combs reads like a charging document filed against a Mafia leader or the head of a drug gang, accusing him of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "The indictment says that with the help of people in his entourage and employees from his network of businesses, Combs engaged in a two-decade pattern of abusive behavior against women and others.",
      "Women were manipulated into participating in drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers that Combs called \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d prosecutors say.",
      "To keep women in line, prosecutors say Combs used a mix of influence and violence: He offered to boost their entertainment careers if they did what he asked \u2014 or cut them off if they didn't.",
      "And when he wasn't getting what he wanted, the indictment says Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts including beatings, kidnapping and arson. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "Combs and his lawyers say he is innocent.",
      "Any group sex was consensual, they say. There was no effort to coerce people into things they didn't want to do, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket, they said.",
      "The trial is expected to take at least eight weeks.",
      "Combs, 55, has acknowledged one episode of violence that is likely to be featured in the trial. In 2016, a security camera recorded him beating up his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. Cassie filed a lawsuit in late 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, did.",
      "Combs\u2019 attorney, Marc Agnifilo has said Combs was \u201cnot a perfect person\u201d and that there had been drug use and toxic relationships, but said that all sexual activity between Combs, Cassie and other people was consensual.",
      "The trial is the latest and most serious in a long string of legal problems for Combs.",
      "In 1999 he was charged with bursting into the offices of an Interscope Records executive with his bodyguards and beating him with a champagne bottle and a chair. The executive, Steve Stoute, later asked prosecutors to go easy on Combs, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and took an anger management class.",
      "Later that same year, Combs was stopped by police after he and his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, fled a nightclub where three people were wounded by gunfire. Combs was acquitted of all charges related to the incident at a 2001 trial, but a rapper in his entourage, Jamal \u201cShyne\u201d Barrow, was convicted in the shooting and served nearly nine years in prison.",
      "Then in 2015, Combs was charged with assaulting someone with a weight-room kettlebell at the the University of California, Los Angeles, where one of his sons played football. Combs said he was defending himself and prosecutors dropped the case.",
      "Now, Combs faces his most serious case yet.",
      "If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.",

    "story": [
      "Vaccination teams are part of an effort by health authorities across Mexico to contain the country\u2019s biggest measles outbreak in decades",
      "CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico -- In a rickety white Nissan, nurse Sandra Aguirre and her vaccination team drive past apple orchards and cornfields stretching to the desert horizon. Aguirre goes door to door with a cooler of measles vaccines. In one of Latin America's biggest Mennonite communities, she knows many will decline to be vaccinated or even open their doors. But some will ask questions, and a handful might even agree to get shots on the spot.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out here every single day,\u201d said Aguirre, pausing to call out to an empty farm, checking for residents. \u201cTo gain trust of the Mennonites \u2013 because they\u2019re reserved and closed-off people \u2013 you have to meet them where they\u2019re at, show a friendly face.\u201d",
      "Aguirre's work is part of an effort by health authorities across the country to contain Mexico's biggest measles outbreak in decades, as cases climb not only here but in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community \u2014 long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities \u2014 in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Officials say results of their campaign alongside Mennonite leaders have been mixed \u2014 they cite tens of thousands of new vaccinations in Chihuahua, but infections have ballooned and spread past the community to Indigenous and other populations.",
      "Federal officials have documented 922 cases and one death in Chihuahua. Officials, health workers and local leaders say the numbers are likely underestimated, and misinformation about vaccines and endemic distrust of authorities are their biggest obstacles.",
      "Pressed against the fringes of the small northern city of Cuauhtemoc, the Mennonite settlement here spans about 40 kilometers (25 miles). With 23,000 residents, it's one of Cuauhtemoc's primary economic engines, but it's an isolated place where families keep to themselves. Some have turned to social media and anti-vaccine websites for research. Others use little technology but visit family in the United States, where they also hear misinformation \u2014 which then spreads through word of mouth.",
      "Chihuahua is a particularly worrisome place, officials say \u2014 as a border state, the risk that the preventable disease will continue spreading internationally and affect the most vulnerable is high.",
      "\u201cWe have a massive flow of people,\u201d said Alexis Hern\u00e1ndez, a Cuauhtemoc health official. \u201cThat makes things a lot more complicated.\u201d",
      "Mexico considered measles eliminated in 1998. But its vaccination rate against the virus was around 76% as of 2023, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 a dip from previous years and well below the 95% rate experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current outbreak began in March. Officials traced it to an 8-year-old unvaccinated Mennonite boy who visited relatives in Seminole, Texas \u2014 at the center of the U.S. outbreak.",
      "Cases rapidly spread through Chihuahua's 46,000-strong Mennonite community via schools and churches, according to religious and health leaders. From there, they said, it spread to workers in orchards and cheese plants.",
      "Gloria Elizabeth Vega, an Indigenous Raramuri woman and single mother, fell sick in March. Because she's vaccinated, measles didn't occur to her until she broke out in hives. Her supervisor at the cheese factory \u2014 who also caught measles \u2014 told her she had to take 10 days of leave and docked her pay 40% for the week, Vega said.",
      "It's rare for vaccinated people to get measles, but officials say that may account for up to 10% of cases here, though they're milder.",
      "Vega tucked herself away in the back of her two-room home, hoping her daughter and mother \u2014 also vaccinated \u2014 wouldn\u2019t get sick. She wishes people would think of others when considering vaccination.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I have enough to be fine,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t think about that other person next to them, or wonder if that person has enough to live off of.\u201d",
      "Vaccination isn't required in Mexico. Schools can request vaccination records, federal health department spokesman Carlos Mateos said, but they cannot deny anyone access to education.",
      "In Chihuahua, some schools started reaching out to parents for copies of vaccination cards and encouraging shots, said Rodolfo Cort\u00e9s, state health ministry spokesman.",
      "It's unknown how many in the Mennonite community have gotten the vaccine \u2014 which is safe, with risks lower than those of measles complications.",
      "Gabriella Villegas, head of vaccination at a clinic treating Mennonites with measles, estimated 70% of community members are not vaccinated. Other health authorities estimated the vaccination rate around 50%.",
      "Mennonites who spoke to The Associated Press \u2014 most on condition of anonymity, fearing backlash \u2014 repeatedly cited vaccine misinformation. One man said U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long record of promoting anti-vaccine views and has called vaccination a personal choice, is a hero.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t accept vaccines; it\u2019s that easy. Because that\u2019s where freedom of expression comes in,\u201d said the man, Jacob Goertzen. \"If we can\u2019t make out own decisions, we don\u2019t live in a democracy.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, Cuauhtemoc\u2019s health director, said outside influences affect community vaccine views.",
      "\u201cThe Mennonite population has a lot of access to social media and family members in the U.S. and Canada, where there are a lot of myths that have taken hold and many more \u2018anti-vaccine\u2019 groups than we have in Mexico,\u201d he said.",
      "During nurse Aguirre's vaccination drive, one man simply said people here \u201cprefer to cure themselves in their own way.\" A mother described getting sick with measles as a \"privilege\" and spoke of putting her unvaccinated 5- and 7-year-olds in a party so everyone could get sick and recover \u2014 a risky tactic doctors have long denounced.",
      "Mexico's lone death from measles was a 31-year-old Mennonite man in the settlement who had diabetes and high blood pressure, underlying conditions that often complicate sicknesses.",
      "Most people in Indigenous and other communities quickly agreed to vaccinate, officials told AP, but in Mennonite areas crews have to do more vigorous outreach \u2014 the door-to-door visits, follow-up calls and conversations, and involvement of local leaders.",
      "In Cuauhtemoc's settlement, that's leaders like Jacob Dyck Penner. As colony president, he and other leaders closed school for two weeks to slow infections, have made a push to show residents they\u2019re working with health authorities, and are encouraging vaccination.",
      "Leaders translate health information into Low German, the native language of most of the community. Penner and others are assisting vaccination teams, making sure families know how to access health services.",
      "\u201cWe had to find this way, together with doctors, to not pressure people or inspire distrust, so they can take their time and make their own decision to accept (being vaccinated),\u201d Penner said.",
      "Medics report more people visiting clinics, seeking vaccines for measles and other diseases. Still, Penner said, there a swath of people will always reject vaccinations.",
      "Health officials like Hern\u00e1ndez say they're concerned in particular for vulnerable populations including Indigenous groups, many of whom have fewer resources to cope.",
      "Vega, the single mother who got measles, said her job at the cheese factory was once a blessing, providing health insurance and steady pay.",
      "But the forced leave and docked pay left her reeling. She said she's living paycheck to paycheck and wonders how she'll pay the bills \u2014 her daughter's school supplies, lunches, tennis shoes.",
      "\u201cI have a daughter to keep afloat,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not like I have the option to wait and pay for things, for food.\u201d",

      "The U.S. had discovered in 2021 that medicines and supplies that were meant to be provided free to Zambians had been taken and were being sold by pharmacies across the country, U.S. Ambassador to Zambia Michael Gonzales said at a press briefing.",
      "He said that an investigation of around 2,000 pharmacies in Zambia between 2021 and 2023 found that nearly half of them were selling medicines and products paid for by U.S. aid funds.",
      "The Zambian government had failed to do enough to address the corruption after the U.S. informed it of the theft scandal in April 2024, Gonzales said.",
      "There was no immediate government comment Thursday.",
      "The $50 million is part of $128 million the U.S. gives to Zambia a year for medicines, medical supplies and other support for its health sector. Gonzales said the cuts would affect medications for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, three critical diseases affecting Zambians.",
      "\u201cThe United States is taking necessary steps to safeguard, and ensure the accountability of, American taxpayer funds,\u201d Gonzales said.",
      "The action was separate to President Donald Trump's decision to cut U.S. foreign aid across the world, Gonzales said.",
      "He said that the U.S. investigation into the theft also found that medications and supplies for Zambia paid for by the Global Fund and other international donors were also being sold in pharmacies.",
      "Gonzales said he had recommended to officials in Washington that the U.S. start cutting the aid from January next year to give Zambia time to plan new procurements of the life-saving drugs.",

      "A new government study provides the most complete picture yet of early-onset cancers, finding that the largest increases are in breast, colorectal, kidney and uterine cancers. Scientists from the National Cancer Institute looked at data that included more than 2 million cancers diagnosed in people 15 to 49 years old between 2010 and 2019.",
      "Of 33 cancer types, 14 cancers had increasing rates in at least one younger age group. About 63% of the early-onset cancers were among women.",
      "\u201cThese kinds of patterns generally reflect something profound going on,\u201d said Tim Rebbeck of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who studies cancer risk and was not involved in the research. \u201cWe need to fund research that will help us understand.\"",
      "The findings were published Thursday in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.",
      "The researchers compared cancer rates in 2019 to what would be expected based on 2010 rates.",
      "Breast cancer made up the largest share of the excess cancers, with about 4,800 additional cases. There were 2,000 more colorectal cancers compared with what would be expected based on the 2010 rates. There were 1,800 more kidney cancers and 1,200 additional uterine cancers.",
      "Reassuringly, death rates were not rising for most cancers in the young adult age groups, although increasing death rates were seen for colorectal, uterine and testicular cancers.",

      "Gates met President Prabowo Subianto at the colonial-style Merdeka palace in Jakarta to discuss global health, nutrition, financial inclusion and public digital infrastructure, Indonesia\u2019s presidential office said in a statement ahead of the meeting.",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and Gates Foundation praised Indonesia's adoption of vaccines like Rotavirus for diarrhea and Pneumococcus for pneumonia and the country's efforts in reducing child mortality.",
      "He said ten million children under the age of five worldwide died when his foundation launched in 2000, with 90% of the deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia or malaria. That number has now been cut in half to below five million, Gates said.",
      "\u201cIt's been an amazing time period. And there\u2019s many new tools coming,\u201d he told the meeting, which was also attended by prominent Indonesian businesspeople and philanthropists.",
      "Gates' foundation is currently developing a tuberculosis vaccine that's planned to be tested in Indonesia, Subianto said.",

      "Gates has granted more than $159 million to Indonesia since 2009. Much of it was allocated to the health sector, especially for vaccine procurement, Subianto said. Thanks to the funds, Subianto said Biofarma, a state-run pharmaceutical company, now can produce two billion doses of its polio vaccine every year, benefiting more than 900 million people in 42 countries.",
      "The Gates Foundation is also planning to roll out a micronutrient supplement for pregnant women in Indonesia in coming months.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration says that a prominent medical contrarian and critic of the drug industry will head its vaccine center",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Vinay Prasad, a prominent critic of the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration, has been named to oversee the health agency\u2019s program for vaccines and biotech drugs.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced the appointment Tuesday in a message to agency staff, praising Prasad's \u201clong and distinguished history in medicine.\u201d",
      "Prasad is the latest in a series of medical contrarians and critics of COVID-19 measures to join the federal government under President Donald Trump.",
      "Unlike political roles such as FDA commissioner, the job Prasad is stepping into has traditionally been held by an FDA career scientist. His appointment raises new questions about whether vaccines and other new therapies will face unnecessary scrutiny from regulators.",
      "Prasad replaces Dr. Peter Marks, FDA\u2019s longtime vaccine chief who resigned in March after clashing with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over concerns about the safety of vaccinations.",
      "In a social media post, Prasad likened Marks to \u201ca bobblehead doll that just stamps approval.\"",
      "Last year, he told former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy that Americans would probably be better off without the FDA in its current form.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about FDA 2024, I think they\u2019d probably be better off as a result of not having the FDA\u201d Prasad said during an appearance on Ramaswamy's podcast.",
      "A professor at the University of California San Francisco, Prasad's medical training is in cancer and blood disorders. He first came to prominence among academics for a series of papers scrutinizing the evidence behind new cancer therapies.",
      "Research by Prasad and his colleagues showed that many cancer drugs fast-tracked by the FDA have never been shown to improve or extend patient lives. Instead, the drugs are often approved based on alternate measures, such as the ability to shrink tumors, which are thought to predict their long-term benefits.",
      "The FDA has long defended this practice as a way of accelerating approval of medicines for desperately ill patients.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prasad reached a much broader audience as a critic of mask mandates, lockdowns and moves to speed the availability of vaccine boosters from Pfizer and Moderna. Many of his views mirror those of other Trump appointees, including Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "In 2022, Prasad and Makary were co-authors on a paper attacking the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. Those patients received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild.",
      "The paper concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions, prompting pushback from many health experts.",
      "In recent years, Prasad become a regular on podcasts associated with Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, which often portrays the FDA as beholden to the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Prasad's appointment is likely to alarm drug and vaccine makers, who depend on the predictability of FDA standards and procedures to guide drug development plans that can span years or even decades.",

      "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital have agreed to a $750 million settlement of hundreds of sexual abuse claims by patients of imprisoned former gynecologist Robert Hadden",
      "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital have agreed to a $750 million settlement of hundreds of sexual abuse claims by patients of disgraced and imprisoned former gynecologist Robert Hadden, bringing total legal payouts in civil cases involving the ex-doctor to over $1 billion, according to the plaintiffs' lawyer.",
      "Hadden, now 66, was accused of molesting patients during a decades-long career at prestigious New York City hospitals including Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian. He was convicted by a jury in 2023 of federal sex crime charges and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "The new settlements, approved by a Manhattan judge Monday, come in 576 legal cases against the Ivy League school, the hospital and others over the abuse by Hadden, plaintiffs' attorney Anthony T. DiPietro said.",
      "\u201cThis victory is not just for the victims and survivors of Columbia University and The New York-Presbyterian Hospital\u2019s cover-up who bravely came forward, but for all of us who entrust medical institutions with our health care,\u201d DiPietro said in statement.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, Columbia and New York-Presbyterian have prioritized protecting their reputations over protecting their patients,\" he said. \"This settlement sends a powerful message that we\u2019re here to ensure that institutions covering up exploitation and abuse will be held fully accountable for their crimes.\u201d",
      "DiPietro said the average payout to plaintiffs from the new settlement will be about $1.3 million. Columbia previously agreed to $277 million in settlements with more than 200 other plaintiffs over Hadden's sexual abuse, he said.",
      "Columbia confirmed the settlement but not the amount Tuesday. Lawyers for the school and New York-Presbyterian did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "\u201cAs previously announced, Columbia is implementing a multi-pronged plan, including an external investigation, a survivors\u2019 settlement fund, and a series of new and updated patient safety policies and programs to address the abuses of Robert Hadden,\" the university said in statement responding to an Associated Press message specifically asking about the $750 million deal.",
      "\u201cWe deeply regret the pain that his patients suffered, and this settlement is another step forward in our ongoing work and commitment to repair harm and support survivors,\u201d it said. \"We commend the survivors for their bravery in coming forward.\u201d",
      "New York-Presbyterian referred questions about the settlement to Columbia, saying the school employed Hadden.",
      "One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits, Laurie Maldonado, who sued Columbia, New York-Presbyterian, Hadden and others, said her case was not about money.",
      "\u201cIt's about accountability,\u201d she said in a statement provided by DiPietro. \"Columbia University enabled sadistic abuse, and now, they\u2019ve been forced to face the truth. We hope this sends a clear message to every institution: survivors will not be silenced, and those who protect abusers will be held responsible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, like Maldonado has.",
      "Hadden\u2019s accusers also included Evelyn Yang, the wife of former presidential candidate and New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, who said Hadden abused her when she was pregnant with her first child.",
      "During Hadden's criminal trial, nine victims testified about how Hadden molested them during gynecology treatments, starting in the late 1980s, at prominent hospitals.",
      "Allegations of misconduct during examinations first surfaced in 2012. Hadden was indicted on state charges in 2014 as women kept coming forward. But in 2016, the office of the Manhattan district attorney at the time, Cyrus Vance Jr., allowed Hadden to plead guilty to two low-level felonies and a misdemeanor in a deal that required him to give up his medical license but did not require jail time and kept him out of the state\u2019s sex offender registry.",
      "Some of the women who had gone to state prosecutors were outraged, but their stories did not start receiving public attention until the #MeToo movement began gaining steam in 2017.",
      "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan got a grand jury indictment against Hadden in 2020, charges based on the fact that some patients at his New York offices had come into the city from other states.",
      "In November 2023, Columbia and Columbia University Irving Medical Center announced they would be notifying 6,500 former patients of Hadden of his federal sex crime convictions and giving victims the opportunity to apply for compensation from a $100 million settlement fund. The deadline to apply has been extended to May 15.",

    "story": [
      "Utah dentists say they\u2019re bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state\u2019s most vulnerable people",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- With Utah's first-in-the-nation ban on fluoride in public drinking water set to take effect Wednesday, dentists who treat children and low-income patients say they're bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state's most vulnerable people.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed the law against the recommendation of many dentists and national health experts who warn removing fluoride will harm tooth development, especially in young patients without regular access to dental care.",
      "The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius, said she does not dispute that fluoride can have some benefits but thinks people should not be given it by the government without their informed consent.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. applauded Utah for being the first state to enact a ban and said he plans to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation nationwide.",
      "Florida could soon become the second state to ban fluoride under a bill awaiting Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 signature. The Ohio and South Carolina legislatures are considering similar measures.",
      "A majority of Utah water systems already did not add fluoride. The state ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents receiving fluoridated water, with about 2 in 5 receiving it in 2022, according to CDC data. The law will impact about 1.6 million people in Salt Lake City and elsewhere in northern Utah who are losing fluoridation, state officials say.",
      "Dentists in Salt Lake City over the past week said many patients were unaware of the upcoming ban, and most did not realize the city had been adding fluoride to their drinking water for nearly two decades.",
      "\u201cI did not know about a ban,\u201d said Noe Figueroa, a patient at Salt Lake Donated Dental Services, a clinic that provides free or heavily discounted dental treatment to low-income residents. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not good. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good at all.\u201d",
      "At Donated Dental, providers expect their monthslong waitlist for children's procedures to grow significantly and their need for volunteer dentists to skyrocket. The effects of the ban in children\u2019s teeth will likely be visible within the next year, said Sasha Harvey, the clinic\u2019s executive director.",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re scheduling into August and September for some 2-, 3-, 4-year-olds that are in so much pain that they can\u2019t eat properly, and there\u2019s nothing we can do but tell parents, \u2018You\u2019re gonna have to wait.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Harvey said, adding that it's likely to get much worse.",
      "The fluoridation process involves supplementing the low levels of naturally occurring fluoride in most water to reach the 0.7 milligrams per liter recommended by the CDC for cavity prevention. Water treatment plants dump fluoride into the water in liquid or powder form and often use dosing pumps to adjust the levels.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population receives fluoridated drinking water, according to health officials. It was long considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Fluoride fortifies teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. It\u2019s especially important to children whose teeth are still developing. For some low-income families, public drinking water containing fluoride may be their only source of preventative dental care.",
      "Some supporters of the Utah law pointed to studies linking high levels of fluoride exposure to illness and low IQ in kids. The National Institutes of Health says it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose from fluoride added to water or toothpaste at standard levels.",
      "The governor said that, like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his children in a community without fluoridated water. Before signing the bill, Cox said there is no difference in health outcomes between communities with and without fluoride \u2014 a statement Utah dentists say is false.",
      "\u201cAny dentist can look in someone\u2019s mouth in Utah and tell exactly where they grew up. Did you grow up in a fluoridated area or a non-fluoridated area? We can tell by the level of decay,\u201d said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.",
      "The law shifts responsibility to individuals, meaning all Utah residents will need to be proactive about their oral health, Harvey said. Most patients at her clinic only come in when a toothache becomes unbearable, and many cannot spare the few dollars a month needed to buy fluoride supplements to add to their drinking water at home.",
      "Figueroa, the free dental clinic patient, said other expenses take priority.",
      "Fluoride toothpaste alone is insufficient for children because it doesn't penetrate the tooth's outer layer, Bekker said. When a person regularly ingests fluoridated water, their saliva bathes the teeth in fluoride throughout the day and makes them stronger.",
      "Bekker said he recommends Utah parents add fluoride supplements to their children\u2019s drinking water. But for families who don\u2019t visit doctors regularly, that may prove difficult.",
      "Fluoride tablets require a prescription from a doctor or dentist. Utah providers are working to make the supplement accessible over the counter, but Bekker said that change may be months or years away.",

      "Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is running for governor in 2026 and sharing new anecdotes in her upcoming political memoir, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d including her experience with miscarriage",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Ahead of a nationally watched bid to become Michigan\u2019s next governor, Democrat Jocelyn Benson is releasing a memoir this month that includes her first public discussion of a miscarriage she had about eight years ago \u2014 an experience she says will shape her commitment to increasing access to reproductive healthcare in the swing state.",
      "Benson, Michigan\u2019s secretary of state, is part of a crowded field seeking to succeed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and she\u2019s the only woman in the running so far.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of Tuesday's release of her political memoir entitled, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d Benson said miscarrying made her value easy access to reproductive health care in an emotional and difficult situation, something she wants to deliver for the state if elected.",
      "\u201cIt opened my eyes to the need to not just protect reproductive freedom and rights, but actually make sure they\u2019re real,\u201d said Benson.",
      "In a chapter entitled \u201cGrit and Grace,\u201d Benson describes finding out she was pregnant shortly after her son\u2019s first birthday and shortly before she launched her bid for secretary of state in 2017. Waves of worry over the timing and elation over becoming a mother of two ensued. But just a day later, she began to miscarry.",
      "She writes about the doctor\u2019s appointment during her eighth week of pregnancy where she learned about her options: surgery, medication or stillbirth and what to expect as her miscarriage continued. By the following morning, she had miscarried on her own.",
      "\u201cThe emotional impact of that stays with you for your whole life,\u201d she told AP.",
      "Benson said she struggled with shame and guilt, emotions she has learned many women experience.",
      "\u201cI want to tell my story to say it\u2019s OK to tell yours as well,\u201d she said.",
      "In the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, women seeking public office have shared personal stories of miscarriages and abortions. Democrats and Republicans alike have spoken about their pregnancies as reproductive and maternal health care became a central concern for Americans.",
      "In Michigan, voters approved a ballot measure in 2022 to protect abortion access, in an election that also saw Democrats sweep statewide and legislative elections. But Benson said that protection isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Step one is to incentivize talented physicians to work in Michigan, she said. Step two is to bolster reproductive health care in rural Michigan, she said, suggesting mobile clinics that can reach remote areas.",
      "She noted the recent closure of three Planned Parenthood locations in Michigan, including its only location in the Upper Peninsula. Some Planned Parenthood locations provide abortions in addition to services such as birth control, disease screenings and miscarriage management.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Michigan leaders cited financial challenges exacerbated by a freeze of federal dollars for the closures. Federal law already prohibited taxpayer dollars from paying for most abortions.",
      "Centering reproductive rights in the 2026 primary will be another test of the issue\u2019s importance to Democratic voters. Benson will face Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the gubernatorial primary. Whitmer, who is term limited, has said she does not plan to endorse in the race.",
      "On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. John James, state Senate Minority Leader Aaric Nesbitt and former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox are vying for the nomination and likely also the endorsement of President Donald Trump.",
      "And the twist \u2014 Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is pursuing the office as an independent. The move comes as Democrats lost considerable ground in the 2024 election. The state swung back to Trump in the 2024 election and Republicans gained a majority in the state House of Representatives, splitting control of the legislature.",
      "Among anecdotes from her memoir that include her tenure as the state's chief election official during the 2020 election and her law career before, Benson took a swing at Duggan over his handling of the 2018 primary election for governor. She criticized him for not supporting Whitmer early in the race and encouraging other Democrats, who are men, to pursue a run, citing reporting in the New Yorker years later.",
      "\u201cI will never forget the message those efforts sent to women across our state,\u201d Benson wrote. She noted that her own primary campaign became tied to Whitmer\u2019s by gender.",
      "\u201cThe argument went something like, surely we can\u2019t have more than one woman on the ticket at the same time,\u201d Benson wrote.",
      "Benson\u2019s memoir comments on Duggan were first reported by the Detroit News. A spokesperson for Duggan\u2019s campaign told the publication that the Detroit mayor endorsed Whitmer in the Democratic primary over two men.",

      "Attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging cuts to the U.S. Health and Human Services agency, saying the Trump administration's massive restructuring has destroyed life-saving programs and left states to pick up the bill for mounting health crises.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Rhode Island on Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James said. The attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia signed onto the complaint.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. restructured the agency in March, eliminating more than 10,000 employees and collapsing 28 agencies under the sprawling HHS umbrella into 15, the attorneys general said. An additional 10,000 employees had already been let go by President Donald Trump's administration, according to the lawsuit, and combined the cuts stripped 25% of the HHS workforce.",
      "\u201cIn its first three months, Secretary Kennedy and this administration deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job,\u201d the attorneys general wrote.",
      "Kennedy has said he is seeking to streamline the nation's public health agencies and reduce redundancies across them with the layoffs. The cuts were made as part of a directive the administration has dubbed, \u201c Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is not government reform. This is not efficiency,\u201d James said during a press conference Monday.",
      "The cuts have resulted in laboratories having limited testing for some infectious diseases, the federal government not tracking cancer risks among U.S. firefighters, early childhood learning programs left unsure of future funds and programs aimed at monitoring cancer and maternal health closing, the attorneys general say. Cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also have hampered states' ability to respond to one of the largest measles outbreaks in recent years, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cThis chaos and abandonment of the Department\u2019s core functions was not an unintended side effect, but rather the intended result,\u201d of the \u201cMAHA Directive,\u201d they said. They want a judge to vacate the directive because they say the administration can't unilaterally eliminate programs and funding that have been created by Congress.",
      "The restructuring eliminated the entire team of people who maintain the federal poverty guidelines used by states to determine whether residents are eligible for Medicaid, nutrition assistance and other programs. A tobacco prevention agency was gutted. Staff losses also were significant at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "The Trump administration is already facing other legal challenges over cuts to public health agencies and research organizations.

      "Instead, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman pointed the AP to a Trump administration budget proposal released Friday. It lacked specifics, but proposes to cut the CDC's core budget by more than half and vows to focus CDC surveillance only on emerging and infectious diseases.",
      "Kennedy has said some of the CDC's other work will be moved to a yet-to-be-created agency, the Administration for a Healthy America. He also has said that the cuts are designed to get rid of waste at a department that has seen its budget grow in recent years.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this extra spending and staff has not improved our nation\u2019s health as a country,\" Kennedy wrote last month in The New York Post. \"Instead, it has only created more waste, administrative bloat and duplication.\"",

      "\u201cIf the U.S. is interested in making itself healthier again, how is it going to know, if it cancels the programs that helps us understand these diseases?\u201d said Graham Mooney, a Johns Hopkins University public health historian.",
      "The core of the nation\u2019s health surveillance is done by the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. Relying on birth and death certificates, it generates information on birth rates, death trends and life expectancy. It also operates longstanding health surveys that provide basic data on obesity, asthma and other health issues.",
      "The center has been barely touched in layoffs, and seems intact under current budget plans.",
      "But many other efforts were targeted by the cuts, the AP found. Some examples:",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which surveys women across the country, lost its entire staff \u2014 about 20 people.",
      "It\u2019s the most comprehensive collection of data on the health behaviors and outcomes before, during and after childbirth. Researchers have been using its data to investigate the nation's maternal mortality problem.",
      "Recent layoffs also wiped out the staffs collecting data on in vitro fertilizations and abortions.",
      "Those cuts are especially surprising given that President Donald Trump said he wants to expand IVF access and that the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 playbook for his administration called for more abortion surveillance.",
      "The CDC eliminated its program on lead poisoning in children, which helped local health departments \u2014 through funding and expertise \u2014 investigate lead poisoning clusters and find where risk is greatest.",
      "Lead poisoning in kids typically stems from exposure to bits of old paint, contaminated dust or drinking water that passes through lead pipes. But the program's staff also played an important role in the investigation of lead-tainted applesauce that affected 500 kids.",
      "Last year, Milwaukee health officials became aware that peeling paint in aging local elementary schools was endangering kids. The city health department began working with CDC to test tens of thousands of students. That assistance stopped last month when the CDC\u2019s lead program staff was terminated.",
      "City officials are particularly concerned about losing expertise to help them track the long-term effects.",
      "\"We don't know what we don't know,\" said Mike Totoraitis, the city\u2019s health commissioner.",
      "Also gone is the staff for the 23-year-old Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, which had information on concerns including possible cancer clusters and weather-related illnesses.",
      "\u201cThe loss of that program is going to greatly diminish the ability to make linkages between what might be in the environment and what health might be affected by that,\u201d Breysse said.",
      "In some cases, it\u2019s not a matter of staffers leaving, but rather the end of specific types of data collection.",
      "Transgender status is no longer being recorded in health-tracking systems, including ones focused on violent deaths and on risky behaviors by kids.",
      "Experts know transgender people are more likely to be victims of violence, but now \u201cit\u2019s going to be much more challenging to quantify the extent to which they are at higher risk,\u201d said Thomas Simon, the recently retired senior director for scientific programs at the CDC's Division of Violence Prevention.",
      "The staff and funding seems to have remained intact for a CDC data collection that provides insights into homicides, suicides and accidental deaths involving weapons.",
      "But CDC violence-prevention programs that acted on that information were halted. So, too, was work on a system that collects hospital data on nonfatal injuries from causes such as shootings, crashes and drownings.",
      "Also going away, apparently, is the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. The system is designed to pick up information that's not found in law enforcement statistics. Health officials see that work as important, because not all sexual violence victims go to police.",
      "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which tracks job-related illnesses and deaths and makes recommendations on how to prevent them, was gutted by the cuts.",
      "Kennedy has said that 20% of the people laid off might be reinstated as the agency tries to correct mistakes.",
      "That appeared to happen last month, when the American Federation of Government Employees said that NIOSH workers involved in a black lung disease program for coal miners had been temporarily called back.",
      "But HHS officials did not answer questions about the reinstatement. The AFGE's Micah Niemeier-Walsh later said the workers continued to have June termination dates and \u201cwe are concerned this is to give the appearance that the programs are still functioning, when effectively they are not.\u201d",
      "There's been no talk of salvaging some other NIOSH programs, including one focused on workplace deaths in the oil and gas industries or a research project into how common hearing loss is in that industry.",
      "The HHS cuts eliminated the 17-member team responsible for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, one of the main ways the government measures drug use.",
      "Also axed were the CDC staff working on the National Youth Tobacco Survey.",
      "There are other surveys that look at youth smoking and drug use, including the University of Michigan's federally funded \u201cMonitoring the Future\u201d survey of schoolkids.",
      "But the federal studies looked at both adults and adolescents, and provided insights into drug use by high school dropouts. The CDC also delved into specific vaping and tobacco products in the ways that other surveys don't, and was a driver in the federal push to better regulate electronic cigarettes.",
      "\"There was overlap among the surveys, but each one had its own specific focus that the other ones didn\u2019t cover,\u201c said Richard Miech, who leads the Michigan study.",
      "Work to modernize data collection has been derailed. That includes an upgrade to a 22-year-old system that helps local public health departments track diseases and allows CDC to put together a national picture.",
      "Another casualty was the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which tries to predict disease trends.",
      "The center, created during the COVID-19 pandemic, was working on forecasting the current multi-state measles outbreak. That forecast hasn't been published partly because of the layoffs, according to two CDC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss it and fear retribution for speaking to the press.",
      "Trump hasn't always supported widespread testing of health problems.",
      "In the spring of 2020, when COVID-19 diagnoses were exploding, the president groused that the nation\u2019s ability to do more testing was making the U.S. look like it had a worse problem than other countries. He called testing \u201ca double-edged sword.\u201d",
      "Mooney, the Johns Hopkins historian, wonders how interested the new administration is in reporting on health problems.",
      "\u201cYou could think it\u2019s deliberate,\" he said. \u201cIf you keep people from knowing, they\u2019re less likely to be concerned.\u201d",

      "The government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted following a deadly mass uprising, announced late Saturday the Awami League party can no longer be active online and elsewhere in the South Asian country under the Anti-Terrorism Act.",
      "The law affairs adviser, Asif Nazrul, said the ban would remain until a special tribunal completes a trial of the party and its leaders over the deaths of hundreds of students and other protesters during an anti-government uprising in July and August last year.",
      "The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the country's other main political party that is headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, had previously opposed the proposal to ban the Awami League party.",
      "The ban is expected to formally come into effect on Monday.",
      "The Awami League's official account on X said Sunday: \u201cPeople no more feel safe under Yunus,\" denouncing the ban that \u201cstoked division within society, strangled democratic norms, fueled ongoing pogrom against dissenters and strangled inclusivity, all undemocratic steps under pretext of making trial of July-August violence and reform scheme.\u201d",
      "The party also condemned the thousands who took to the streets for two days, including supporters of a newly formed political party by students and Islamists from various groups who later joined the protests, who called for the Awami League to be banned. It accused the gatherings of being \u201cstate-sponsored.\u201d",
      "Thousands of protesters had issued an ultimatum to the government ban the Awami League party by Saturday night.",

      "AMSTERDAM -- The fire that caused significant damage in April to historic buildings in Suriname's capital city was not the only threat facing the nearby Neveh Shalom Synagogue.",
      "As firefighters battled to save the historic city center of Paramaribo \u2014 a UNESCO World Heritage site \u2014 the synagogue's volunteers were busy scanning thousands of archival documents in an effort to preserve the history of the thousands of Jews who have called the Surinamese capital home since the 1700s.",
      "The blaze was contained before reaching the synagogue, but at the mercy of other threats, including the tropical climate, insects and time, it was a reminder of how fragile the 100,000 historic documents, kept on pages stored in filing cabinets for decades, were and how vital the preservation project was.",
      "The operation to digitize the birth records, land sales and correspondence has been overseen by Dutch academic Rosa de Jong, who had used the archive as part of a PhD study on how Jewish refugees fled the horrors of World War II to the Caribbean, including the tiny South American country of Suriname.",
      "\u201cI felt that my work comes with an obligation to preserve the past that I\u2019m building my career on,\u201d De Jong told The Associated Press.",
      "When she finished her academic research, at the University of Amsterdam, last year, De Jong saw an opportunity to return to Suriname and safeguard the files that had been crucial to her work.",
      "She raised the financing for cameras, hard drives and travel expenses and returned to Suriname with the aim of making high-quality scans of the hundreds of folios held by the synagogue.",
      "The result is more than 600 gigabytes of data stored on multiple hard drives. One will be donated to the National Archives of Suriname to be included in their digital collections.",
      "The archived documents show how Suriname was a hub of Jewish life for the Americas. The British who colonized the region gave Jews political and religious autonomy when they first moved to Suriname in 1639 to manage tobacco and sugar cane plantations.",
      "When the Dutch took control of the colony, they continued this practice. When Jewish people were forced out of other places in the Americas, they often fled to Suriname.",
      "On Christmas Eve in 1942, more than 100 Dutch Jewish refugees, fleeing the horrors of the Holocaust, arrived in Paramaribo.",
      "Liny Pajgin Yollick, then 18, was among them. In an oral history project for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, she described the relief she felt when she arrived in Suriname to the sound of a familiar song.",
      "\u201cI remember it was morning and they played Dutch National Anthem for us when we arrived, and everybody was crying. We were very emotional when we heard that because many of us never thought we would ever hear it again,\u201d she said.",
      "When the Netherlands was freed from Nazi German occupation three years later, Teroenga, the magazine published for the Jewish congregations in Suriname, ran with the headline \u201cBevrijding\u201d (\u201cLiberation\u201d). The archive at Neveh Shalom has a copy of every edition of Teroenga.",
      "Key to De Jong's preservation project has been 78-year-old Lilly Duijm, who was responsible for the archive's folders of documents for more than two decades.",
      "Born in Suriname, when she was 14 she moved to the Netherlands where she eventually became a nurse. But she returned to her homeland in 1973, just before the colony got its independence, and her four children grew up in Paramaribo.",
      "More than anyone, she knows how precious the archive was.",
      "\u201cI told the congregation, as long as the archive is still here, I will not die. Even if I live to be 200 years old,\u201d she tearfully told AP. \u201cThis is keeping the history of my people.\u201d",

      "The new pope Leo XIV is scheduled to deliver his first Sunday blessing from the loggia where he first appeared in public after being elected three days ago",
      "VATICAN CITY -- For thousands of Catholic pilgrims in Rome, it\u2019s the unmissable Vatican appointment: the midday Sunday blessing the pope delivers from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "The new pope, Leo XIV, is scheduled to deliver his first such prayer on Sunday from the loggia where he first appeared in public after being elected three days ago.",
      "Here is a look at the history, meaning and memorable moments from Sunday blessings of popes past.",
      "In 1954, which he had declared a special year of veneration to the Virgin Mary, Pope Pius XII started reciting in public a traditional Catholic midday prayer to her. He first delivered it from the pope's summer residence, just outside Rome at Castel Gandolfo.",
      "Back at the Vatican, he kept it up from a window facing St. Peter\u2019s Square at the Apostolic Palace, the 16th century building where the papal apartments are. Pope Francis broke with tradition by living at a Vatican guest house instead but still maintained the Sunday prayer tradition from the palace.",
      "It\u2019s become a chance for ordinary faithful to see the pope relatively up close. Especially since the papacy of St. John Paul II \u2013 from 1978 to 2005 \u2013 popes have added short messages touching on different topics of the day.",
      "When a pope misses the weekly occasion \u2013 as Francis did earlier this year during his hospitalization \u2013 it makes global news.",
      "The Vatican announced Leo would deliver his first such prayer on Sunday, which is coincidentally Mother\u2019s Day in Italy and the United States, among other countries.",
      "The Angelus is the short prayer to Mary that many Catholics recite daily.",
      "Often prayed before Mass, but traditionally accompanied by the tolling of bells at dawn, midday and early evening, it references the moment when the Gospels say the Archangel Gabriel told Mary she would become the mother of God, and she accepted.",
      "\u201cAngelus\u201d is Latin for angel, and the prayer\u2019s first verse is \u201cThe Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary.\u201d The faithful then answer, \u201cAnd she conceived of the Holy Spirit,\u201d followed by a Hail Mary and a few more verses and prayers.",
      "This \u201cannunciation\u201d scene is so pivotal in Christian dogma that it\u2019s been represented by some of the most celebrated painters for centuries. Some artists have also portrayed the faithful reciting the Angelus, a practice that is believed to have started in the Middle Ages.",
      "During Eastertime \u2013 the current liturgical season, spanning 50 days from Easter Sunday to Pentecost \u2013 the prayer is substituted with another devotion to Mary, the Regina Coeli (also spelled Caeli, Latin for \u201cQueen of Heaven\u201d) that encourages rejoicing in Christ\u2019s resurrection.",
      "Looking frail, St. John Paul II appeared at his hospital window for his last Angelus prayer less than three weeks before he died in 2005. He didn\u2019t speak, only blessing the crowd with an olive branch. An archbishop delivered his message, with the trademark exhortation to young people not to be afraid to follow Jesus.",
      "Tens of thousands of people packed St. Peter\u2019s Square when Pope Benedict XVI gave his final Sunday prayer in 2013 before becoming the first pope in 600 years to resign. They cheered him on as he reassured the faithful he wasn\u2019t abandoning the church, but rather turning to prayer because of his advancing age.",
      "At his first Angelus in 2013, Francis introduced a key motif of his papacy: mercy. \u201cA bit of mercy makes the world less cold and more just,\u201d he told the crowd.",
      "More recently, Francis used the Sunday blessings to call for peace, especially in Ukraine and Gaza. But he also would close his blessings with the down-to-earth phrase, \u201cHave a good lunch.\"",

      "As Poland gears up for the May 18 presidential election, a striking political shift is taking shape: the once-unifying cause of support for Ukrainians is turning into a wedge issue on the campaign trail",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- In the early months of 2022, as Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, millions of Ukrainians \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 fled to Poland, where they were met with an extraordinary outpouring of sympathy. Ukrainian flags appeared in windows. Polish volunteers rushed to the border with food, diapers, SIM cards. Some opened their homes to complete strangers.",
      "In the face of calamity, Poland became not just a logistical lifeline for Ukraine, but a paragon of human solidarity.",
      "Three years later, Poland remains one of Ukraine\u2019s staunchest allies \u2014 a hub for Western arms deliveries and a vocal defender of Kyiv\u2019s interests. But at home, the tone toward Ukrainians has shifted.",
      "Nearly a million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland, with roughly 2 million Ukrainian citizens overall in the nation of 38 million people. Many of them arrived before the war as economic migrants.",
      "As Poland heads into a presidential election on May 18, with a second round expected June 1, the growing fatigue with helping Ukrainians has become so noticeable that some of the candidates have judged that they can win more votes by vowing less help for Ukrainians.",
      "\u201cThe mood of Polish society has changed towards Ukrainian war refugees,\u201d said Piotr D\u0142ugosz, a professor of sociology at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow who has carried out research on the views toward Ukrainians across central Europe.",
      "He cited a survey by the Public Opinion Research Center in Warsaw that showed support for helping Ukrainians falling from 94% at the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 to 57% in December 2024.",
      "\u201cMany other studies confirm the change in mood,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, it should be remembered that helping refugees after the outbreak of the war was a natural moral reflex, that one should help a neighbor in need. All the more so because Poles remember the crimes committed by Russians against Poles during and after two world wars.\u201d",
      "Among those to transform the shift in mood into campaign politics is conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki, a historian and head of the Institute of National Remembrance who is the Law and Justice party\u2019s chosen candidate and one of the frontrunners.",
      "Law and Justice, still in government in 2022, led the humanitarian response to the crisis along with President Andrzej Duda, a conservative backed by the party who traveled to Kyiv during the war.",
      "As Nawrocki seeks to succeed Duda, he is showing ambivalence toward Ukrainians, stressing the need to defend Polish interests above all else.",
      "Duda and Law and Justice have long admired Donald Trump, and Nawrocki \u2014 who was welcomed at the White House by Trump on May 1 \u2014 has at times used language that echoes the American president's.",
      "\u201cUkraine does not treat us as a partner. It behaves in an indecent and ungrateful way in many respects,\u201d Nawrocki said in January.",
      "After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s tense visit to the Oval Office in February, Nawrocki declared the Ukrainian leader needed to \u201crethink\u201d his behavior toward allies.",
      "Last month Nawrocki vowed that if he wins, he will introduce legislation that would prioritize Polish citizens over Ukrainians when there are waits for medical services or schools.",
      "\u201cPolish citizens must have priority,\u201d Nawrocki said in a campaign video. \u201cPoland first. Poles first.\u201d",
      "Further to the right, candidate S\u0142awomir Mentzen and his Confederation party have gone beyond that. He has blamed Ukrainians for overburdened schools, inflated housing prices, and accused them of taking advantage of Polish generosity.",
      "At an April 30 rally of a far-right candidate, Grzegorz Braun, his supporters climbed up to a balcony on city hall in Bia\u0142a Podlaska and pulled down a Ukrainian flag that had been hanging there since February 2022 as an expression of solidarity.",
      "The political center is adjusting too.",
      "Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, the liberal-minded mayor of Warsaw from Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist party who welcomed Ukrainians to his city in 2022, proposed in January that only Ukrainian refugees who \u201cwork, live and pay taxes\u201d in Poland be granted access to the popular \u201c800+\u201d child benefit \u2014 800 zlotys ($210) per month per child.",
      "The requirements were already tightened recently, and some refugee advocates described it as a concession to far-right narratives.",
      "Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Bodnar disputes claims that Ukrainians are taking more than they give. About 35,000 receive support without working, he said, but what they receive is only a fraction of what Ukrainians contribute in taxes. He noted that some 70,000 Ukrainian-run businesses now operate in Poland.",
      "\u201cUkrainians are helping the Polish economy to develop,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "Ma\u0142gorzata Bonikowska, president of the Center for International Relations, said that it is normal for tensions to emerge when large numbers of people from different cultures suddenly live and work side-by-side. And Poles, she added, often find Ukrainians pushy or entitled, and that rubs them the wrong way. \u201cBut there is still very stable support for helping Ukraine. We truly believe Ukrainians are Europeans, they are like our brothers.\u201d",
      "Rafa\u0142 Pankowski, a sociologist who heads Never Again, a group that fights xenophobia, has tracked anti-Ukrainian sentiment from the start of the full-scale war. At first, the far right was very isolated in its anti-Ukrainian opinions, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat is happening this year is harvest time for all those anti-Ukrainian propagandists, and now it goes beyond the far right,\" he said.",
      "Kateryna, a 33-year-old Ukrainian who has lived in Poland for years, has seen the change up close. In 2022, strangers often greeted her with sympathetic looks and with the words \u201cSlava Ukraini\u201d (Glory to Ukraine).",
      "But then last fall, a man on a tram cursed her for reading a Ukrainian book. This spring, outside a social security office, another man shoved her and screamed, \u201cNo one wants you here.\u201d",
      "Such incidents remain rare \u2014 Poles and Ukrainians co-existing on friendly terms is still the norm. But she feels such incidents were unthinkable three years ago.",
      "She asked that her last name not be used because she works as a manager in a company that would require to have clearance to be identified publicly.",
      "Her parents remain in Ukraine, and her brother serves in the army. Like many in the region, she believes Ukrainian resistance is keeping Poland safe by holding the Russians at bay.",
      "Tensions now, she worries, only serve Moscow. \u201cWe must stick together,\u201d she said.",

      "QUITO, Ecuador -- Five fishermen who spent 55 days adrift at sea arrived Saturday at a port in the Galapagos Islands after being rescued by a tuna boat, the Ecuadorian navy said on X.",
      "The three Peruvians and two Colombians had been missing since mid-March and were found on May 7 by an Ecuadorian boat called Aldo.",
      "The fishermen had reported damage to the boat\u2019s alternator two days after setting sail from Pucusana Bay, to the south of Peru\u2019s capital Lima, the navy said in a separate post on Friday.",
      "The failure caused communication and navigation tools to malfunction, Ecuadorian navy Frigate Capt. Maria Fares told The Associated Press, adding that they had no power on the boat.",
      "\u201cThey had no starter, lights and everything that a battery generates,\u201d she said. To survive, they had to \u201ctake rusted water out of the engine (and) when a fish passed by, they caught it and parboiled it to eat.\u201d Fares added that they also drank rain and sea water to survive.",
      "The men are in stable condition and the navy said it is coordinating with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries.",
      "Earlier this year, another Peruvian fisherman, 61-year-old M\u00e1ximo Napa, spent 95 days at sea alone. He was also rescued by an Ecuadorian vessel and returned to Lima in mid-March to be reunited with his family.",

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- The interim government in Bangladesh on Saturday banned all activities of the former ruling Awami League party headed by former influential Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted last year in a mass uprising.",
      "Asif Nazrul, the country's law affairs adviser, said late Saturday the interim Cabinet headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus decided to ban the party's activities online and elsewhere under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act. The ban would stay in place until a special tribunal completes a trial of the party and its leaders over the deaths of hundreds of students and other protesters during an anti-government uprising in July and August last year.",
      "\u201cThis decision is aimed at ensuring national security and sovereignty, protection of activists of the July movement, and plaintiffs and witnesses involved in the tribunal proceedings,\" Nazrul told reporters after a special Cabinet meeting.",
      "Nazrul said the meeting Saturday also expanded scope for trying any political parties involving charges of killing during the anti-Hasina protest being handled by the International Crimes Tribunal.",
      "He said a government notification regarding the ban would be published soon with details.",
      "Hasina and many of her senior party colleagues have been accused of murder in many cases after her ouster last year. Hasina has been in exile in India since Aug. 5 as her official residence was stormed by protesters soon after she left the country.",
      "The United Nations human rights office in a report said in February that up to 1,400 people may have been killed during three weeks of anti-Hasina protest.",
      "Saturday night's dramatic decision came after thousands of protesters, including supporters of a newly formed political party by students, took to the streets in Dhaka and issued an ultimatum to ban the Awami League party by Saturday night. The members of the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party also prominently took part in the protest.",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Hasina or her party, but the chief of the National Citizen Party, Nahid Islam, who is also a student leader, applauded the Yunus-led government for its decision.",
      "The student-led uprising ended Hasina's 15 years of rule, and three days after her fall Yunus took the helm as interim leader.",

The two leaders met Friday in Moscow on the sidelines of the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.",

      "China, along with Russia, is a major arms supplier to Myanmar\u2019s military in its war against pro-democracy and ethnic minority resistance forces. Beijing is also Myanmar\u2019s biggest trading partner and has invested billions of dollars in mines, oil and gas pipelines, and other infrastructure. Its interests in security in Myanmar are especially strong because the two nations share an 890-mile (1,440-kilometer) border",
      "China\u2019s government has maintained good working relations with Myanmar\u2019s ruling military, which is shunned and sanctioned by many Western nations for the army's February 2021 takeover from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and for major human rights violations.",
      "It is also one of the countries providing major relief and reconstruction assistance after the 7.7-magnitude March 28 earthquake that killed more than 3,700 people in Myanmar and injured more than 5,100.",

      "It was widely seen at the time as having Beijing\u2019s tacit support to help stamp out rampant organized crime activities in areas controlled by ethnic Chinese.",
      "In early 2024, Beijing helped broker a ceasefire, but that quickly fell apart when the alliance launched new attacks. Myanmar\u2019s ruling generals and China\u2019s government showed concern as pro-democracy guerrillas and armed ethnic minority groups, sometimes working hand in hand, gained the initiative in fighting.",

      "GENEVA -- President Donald Trump said \u201cgreat progress\u201d was being made in ongoing U.S.-China talks over tariffs menacing the global economy, and even suggested a \u201ctotal reset\" was on the table as tariff negotiations are set to continue Sunday in Switzerland.",
      "No major breakthrough was announced in discussions that lasted over 10 hours between U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and a delegation led by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Still, Trump struck an upbeat tone.",
      "\u201cA very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland. Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner,\u201d the president wrote on his Truth Social platform. \u201cWe want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!\u201d",
      "He gave no further details, and officials at the White House also offered little information during and after the opening day of discussions.",
      "Trump's post followed an official telling The Associated Press that talks would continue Sunday. The official requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff. They've been shrouded in secrecy, and neither side made comments to reporters as they left.",
      "In an editorial late Saturday, China's official Xinhua News Agency said the talks had come about \u201cat the request of the U.S. side\u201d \u2014 noting an earlier point of contention \u2014 and said China agreed to them \u201cafter taking full account of global expectations, national interests and appeals from U.S. businesses and consumers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhether the road ahead involves negotiation or confrontation, one thing is clear: China\u2019s determination to safeguard its development interests is unshakable, and its stance on maintaining the global economic and trade order remains unwavering,\u201d Xinhua said.",
      "\u201cTalks should never be a pretext for continued coercion or extortion, and China will firmly reject any proposal that compromises core principles or undermines the broader cause of global equity,\u201d it added.",
      "Several convoys of black vehicles left the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, which hosted the talks aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks took place.",
      "The opening day of negotiations were held in the sumptuous 18th-century \u201cVilla Saladin\u201d overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government.",
      "Trump's assessment aside, prospects for a major breakthrough appeared dim when the talks opened. Still, there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they have slapped on each other\u2019s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries\u2019 boycotting each other\u2019s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "And even before talks got underway, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \u201c 80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\u201cThe best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\u201d she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \u201cIt cannot just be words.\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example, imposed a 10% tax on imports from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States.",
      "The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump\u2019s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.",
      "During Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2014 such as China\u2019s subsidies \u2014 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn\u2019t come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China's tech policy now resumes.",
      "Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Trump last month suspended plans to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he has reduced those taxes to 10% but could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\u201cAn increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland\u2019s interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\u201d the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \u201cis therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\u201d",
      "The government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another 21% beginning Wednesday.",
      "The United States is Switzerland\u2019s second-biggest trading partner after the EU \u2013 the 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",

      "\u201cHe was always very welcoming, very close to the people,\u201d Laura Vargas, secretary of the Interreligious Council of Peru, who helped organize the event, recalled in a phone interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cHe had no problem saying yes when we proposed it \u2014 he was genuinely interested in social pastoral work.\u201d",
      "Since then, Prevost deepened his ties with interfaith environmental networks like the Interfaith Rainforest Initiative and Indigenous organizations such as AIDESEP, which place forest protection and rights at the center of Church concern.",
      "Such credentials have brought hope to clergymen and faithful in the Amazon region, a vast area with 48 million residents and 6.7 million square kilometers (2.6 million square miles) in South America. They see Chicago-born Prevost, who spent about two decades in Peru\u2019s countryside, as a pontiff who protect the region and fight against climate change.",
      "Many Catholics have said they believe Prevost\u2019s experience as bishop of Chiclayo, a city of 630,000 residents in Northern Peru and not too far from the Amazon, was one of the key reasons he was chosen. They also said the pontiff\u2019s hands-on experience in an impoverished area far from major cities could also serve him well in dealing with the Amazon and navigating its challenges.",
      "The Amazon is a key regulator of the climate, as its dense forests absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that when released into the atmosphere heats the planet. But many parts of the Amazon are under threat from a wide range of illegal activities: farmers clearing trees to raise cows, gold miners dredging rivers and destroying local ecosystems and land-grabbers seizing territories. Wildfires and droughts, exacerbated by climate change, have also hit Amazon communities hard in recent years.",
      "Prevost is well acquainted with these issues, having presided over the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, which helped him bond with colleagues of the nine countries touched by the Amazon. Many of them are among the 105 bishops of an organization he openly supports, the Pan-Amazonian Ecclesial Network, a Catholic Church network focused on the Amazon region.",
      "\u201cI spoke to him a number times about the Amazon and the environment. He doesn\u2019t need to be convinced of its importance,\u201d said Cardinal Pedro Barreto, the president of the network, who has known Prevost since he became the bishop of Chiclayo in 2015.",
      "Brazilian Friar Paulo Xavier agrees.",
      "\u201cLeo will follow Francis; we are going forward with environment protection,\" Xavier said. \u201cThe Holy Spirit has acted on our behalf.\u201d",
      "Xavier is based in Manaus, a city of 2 million residents in the Amazon which received its first-ever cardinal appointed by Francis in 2022: the now 74-year-old archbishop Leonardo Steiner, an enthusiast of Laudato Si.",
      "Steiner, Xavier and the Manaus archdiocese have invested to get the encyclical into the hands of locals, even when that means jumping on small, motorized canoes through the brown waters of the Negro River to reach isolated villages in journeys that can last days on a boat.",
      "In November 2024, the Vatican News reported that Prevost called for more action to tackle climate change and protect the environment during a seminar in Rome. He cited efforts the Vatican has taken such as installing solar panels and electric vehicles.",
      "On the social media platform X, Prevost has reposted messages about protecting the environment. One message he reposted on April 1, 2017, expressed concern about emissions of carbon dioxide, a planet-warming gas, during President Donald Trump\u2019s his first term.",
      "Laura Vicu\u00f1a, an Indigenous woman of the Kariri people and the vice president of the Ecclesial Conference of the Amazon Region, said in a letter published on social media that she hopes the pope will be an ally in the fight against climate change. The conference was created by Francis in 2020 to promote discussion between clergymen and laypeople.",
      "\u201cFrom our dear Amazon, we plead with you to be our ally in the defense of what is the most sacred for us; life, land and rights,\u201d Vicu\u00f1a wrote.",
      "Indigenous peoples like Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s Kariri are often regarded as key protectors of the Amazon, but for many years they have been forced out of their lands by criminals, deforestation and famine, as seen in the Yanomami lands in Northern Brazil in 2023.",
      "Spaniard Luis Ventura, the executive-secretary of Brazil\u2019s Indigenous Missionary Council, said he prays for the new pope to keep his eyes close to the Amazon, with a special attention to the Indigenous. Founded in 1972, the council had rare occasions to meet with pontiffs until Francis rose in 2013. Its members hope Leo doesn\u2019t change that.",
      "\u201cLeo XIV will have a big impact on the Amazon,\" said Ventura. \u201cHis life was always with the people in Peru, and that allows us to think the church will be deep into the territory.\u201d",
      "Francis showed great interest in the Amazon during his pontificate. Four years after Laudato Si, he hosted the Amazon Synod, which sought \u201cnew Paths for the Church and for an integral ecology.\u201d",
      "Rose Bertoldo, one of the secretaries of the Manaus archdiocese, said she is hopeful for the region\u2019s future under Leo, given it would build on Francis\u2019 interest. She added the new pontiff will have a chance to visit Brazil, the nation with the most Catholics in the world, during this year\u2019s U.N. climate summit, known as COP30, in the Amazonian city of Belem in November.",
      "\u201cWe know that the urgencies and the challenges in the Amazon will be bigger because of the global political context of division. We need him at COP,\u201d Bertoldo said.",
      "Irish priest Peter Hughes, who spent most of his life in Peru, met Prevost shortly after he arrived in the Andean nation in 1985. They quickly became friends, and would see each other when the bishop of Chiclayo was in the capital Lima.",
      "\u201cBack then, (Prevost) was worried about extractivism in the Amazon and the effect it had on the poor,\" said Hughes, referring to the new pontiff. \u201cNow it is a much more complex world, the urgency is evident.\u201d",

      "South Korea\u2019s embattled conservative party has canceled then reinstated the presidential candidacy of Kim Moon Soo within hours, after a failed attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s embattled conservative party canceled then reinstated the presidential candidacy of Kim Moon Soo within hours as internal turmoil escalated ahead of the June 3 election.",
      "Saturday's chaotic U-turn, after a failed attempt to replace Kim with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, underscored the People Power Party\u2019s leadership crisis following the ouster of former President Yoon Suk Yeol over his martial law imposition in December, which possibly doomed the conservatives\u2019 chances of winning another term in government.",
      "Kim, a staunch conservative and former labor minister under Yoon, was named the PPP\u2019s presidential candidate on May 3 after winning 56.3% of the primary vote, defeating a reformist rival who had criticized Yoon\u2019s martial law. But the PPP\u2019s leadership, dominated by Yoon loyalists, had spent the past week desperately pressuring Kim to step aside and back Han, whom they believed stood a stronger chance against liberal Democratic Party frontrunner Lee Jae-myung.",
      "After talks between Han and Kim failed to unify their candidacies, the PPP\u2019s emergency committee took the unprecedented step early Saturday of nullifying its primary, canceling Kim\u2019s nomination and registering Han as both a party member and its new presidential candidate. However, the replacement required approval through an all-party vote conducted through an automated phone survey, which ultimately rejected the switch on Saturday night.",
      "\u201cWhile we cannot disclose the figures, the vote on switching the candidate was rejected by a narrow margin,\u201d party spokesman and lawmaker Shin Dong-wook said. Kim, who had denounced the party\u2019s attempt to replace him as an \u201covernight political coup,\u201d was immediately reinstated as the candidate and plans to officially register with election authorities on Sunday, according to the party.",
      "\u201cNow everything will return to its rightful place,\u201d Kim said in a statement.",
      "Kim, 73, was a prominent labor activist in the 1970s and \u201980s, but joined a conservative party in the 1990s, saying he gave up his dream of becoming a \"revolutionist\u201d after witnessing the collapse of communist states. Since then, he has served eight years as governor of South Korea\u2019s Gyeonggi province and completed three terms in the National Assembly.",
      "Han served as acting president after Yoon was impeached by the legislature in December and officially removed by the Constitutional Court in April. He resigned from office May 2 to pursue a presidential bid, arguing his long public service career qualifies him to lead the country amid growing geopolitical uncertainty and trade challenges intensified by the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Han, who had called for unity after being promoted as the candidate, said in a statement that he \u201chumbly accepts\u201d the voice of party members.",
      "Han and Kim have lagged well behind Lee in recent opinion polls. Lee, who spearheaded the Democrats\u2019 efforts to oust Yoon, ridiculed the PPP efforts to switch candidacies, telling reporters Thursday, \u201cI have heard of forced marriages but never heard of forced unity.\u201d",

      "Thousands of people have gathered in Romania\u2019s capital for a pro-European Union march",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Thousands of people gathered in Romania's capital on Friday for a pro-European Union march. It came a week before the final vote of a closely watched presidential election that pits a hard-right nationalist front-runner against the capital\u2019s pro-EU mayor.",
      "Marchers converged in Bucharest in front of the government building, where many waved the blue and yellow flags of Europe. Many chanted slogans such as \u201cWe are in Europe\u201d and \u201cBucharest is not Budapest,\u201d referring to Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, a member but also a longtime critic of the EU.",
      "A communist country until 1989, Romania joined the EU in 2007. But last year it was plunged into its worst political crisis in decades when a top court voided the previous election. The far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped the first round following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow has denied.",
      "The rally was held nearly a week after the first round of a presidential election redo that saw hard-right nationalist George Simion, 38, emerge as the front-runner. In second place was 55-year-old incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan.",
      "\u201cWe need to develop \u2026 we want to be like the best countries, and we don\u2019t have the possibilities on our own,\u201d said Stefan Gheorghe, a 23-year-old lawyer. \u201cYou need the European Union to help us out. It is very important to us to stay together \u2026 and to benefit from each other.\u201d",
      "A median of polls ahead of the runoff suggests Simion holds a lead in the vote, which will be held between the two staunchly antiestablishment candidates on May 18. Observers have warned that the outcome could reshape the EU and NATO member country\u2019s geopolitical direction.",
      "After reaching second place on Sunday night, Dan called the final vote a choice \u201cbetween a pro-Western direction for Romania and an anti-Western one.\u201d",
      "Simion\u2019s critics have long accused him of being Russia-friendly and warn that his presidency would undermine both the EU and NATO as Moscow\u2019s war drags on in Ukraine. But in an interview with The Associated Press this week, Simion rejected the accusations and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not for the good of the Romanian people to be close to Russia.\"",
      "\u201cWe want to be a member of the European Union. Some fake news were saying that we want to exit the European project,\u201d said Simion, who leads Romania's second-largest party, the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave. We are here to stay. We invested a lot.\u201d",
      "Simion, who came fourth in last year\u2019s race and later backed Georgescu, said in an earlier interview with the AP that he wants to see \"more power\" go to the bloc\u2019s 27 individual members, \u201cnot toward the European institutions.\u201d",
      "Similar rallies were held in several cities across Romania on Friday to mark Europe Day, a date that proclaims to celebrate peace and unity in Europe.",
      "Although Simion and Dan are ideological opposites, they both made their political careers railing against Romania\u2019s old political class, which has fallen out of favor as strong antiestablishment sentiment among voters grips the country.",
      "For Diana Draghici, 38, the upcoming runoff will be a pivotal moment for Romania\u2019s future and a choice between forging stronger EU ties or potentially shifting East.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important that the young people who were undecided and didn\u2019t vote so far ... to have a wake-up call and choose who they want to have represented,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could decide two extremely different scenarios for Romania\u2019s future.\u201d",

      "Details about when and where she died, as well as the cause of death, were not immediately available. The foundation did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment.",
      "She died the week of the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany\u2019s unconditional surrender in World War II.",
      "After spending much of her life in the United States, Friedl\u00e4nder returned to live in the German capital in her 80s. She was honored with Germany\u2019s highest decoration and with a statue at Berlin\u2019s City Hall.",
      "\u201cWhat I do gives me my strength and probably also my energy, because I speak for those who can no longer speak,\u201d Friedl\u00e4nder said at an event at Berlin\u2019s Jewish Museum in 2018.",
      "\u201cI would like to say that I don\u2019t just speak for the 6 million Jews who were killed, but for all the people who were killed \u2014 innocent people,\u201d she said.",
      "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier expressed his condolences in a statement, saying she gave Germany reconciliation despite the horrors she went through here in her life. Steinmeier said the country cannot be grateful enough for her gift.",
      "A report released last month said more than 200,000 Jewish survivors are still alive but 70% of them will be gone within the next 10 years.",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder was born Margot Bendheim on Nov. 5, 1921. Her father, Artur Bendheim, owned a shop in Berlin. He had fought for Germany and had been decorated in World War I.",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder recalled that, after the Nazis took power, her father initially said that \u201cthey don\u2019t mean us; We\u2019re Germans.\u201d She added that \u201cwe didn\u2019t see it until it was too late.\"",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder wanted to design clothes and started an apprenticeship as a tailor. After her parents divorced in 1937, Friedl\u00e4nder, her mother and younger brother went to live with her grandparents. In 1941, they had to move to a so-called \u201cJewish apartment,\u201d and Friedl\u00e4nder was forced to work nights at a metal factory.",
      "In January 1943, just as the family was planning to flee Berlin, Friedl\u00e4nder returned home to discover that her brother, Ralph, had been taken away by the Gestapo. A neighbor told her that her mother had decided to go to the police and \u201cgo with Ralph, wherever that may be.\u201d",
      "She passed on her mother\u2019s final message \u2014 \u201cTry to make your life,\u201d which would later become the title of Friedl\u00e4nder's autobiography \u2014 along with her handbag.",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder went into hiding, taking off the yellow star that Jews were obliged to wear. She recalled getting her hair dyed red, reasoning that \u201cpeople think Jews don\u2019t have red hair.\u201d",
      "She said that 16 people helped keep her under the radar over the next 15 months.",
      "That ended in April 1944 when she was taken in by police after being stopped for an identity check after leaving a bunker following an air raid. She said she quickly decided to tell the truth and say that she was Jewish.",
      "\u201cThe running and hiding was over,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt separated from the fate of my people. I had felt guilty every day; had I gone with my mother and my brother, I would at least have known what had happened to them.\u201d",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder arrived in June 1944 at the packed Theresienstadt camp. In the spring of 1945, she recalled later, she saw the arrival of skeletal prisoners who had been forced onto death marches from Auschwitz ahead of that camp\u2019s liberation.",
      "\u201cAt that moment, we heard of the death camps, and at that moment I understood that I would not see my mother and my brother again,\u201d she said. Both were killed at the Auschwitz death camp.",
      "Her father had fled in 1939 to Belgium. He later went to France, where he was interned, before being deported in 1942 to Auschwitz, where he was also killed.",
      "Shortly after the camp\u2019s liberation, she married Adolf Friedl\u00e4nder, an acquaintance from Berlin whom she met again at Theresienstadt. He had a sister in America, and \u2014 after months in a camp for displaced persons \u2014 they arrived in New York in 1946.",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder stayed away from Germany for 57 years. She and her husband became U.S. citizens; she worked as a tailor and later ran a travel agency.",
      "Adolf Friedl\u00e4nder died in 1997, aged 87. Margot returned to Germany for the first time in 2003, when she was received at Berlin\u2019s City Hall along with others who had been pushed out by the Nazis.",
      "In 2010, she moved back to the German capital, where she told her story to students and was decorated with, among other things, the country\u2019s highest honor, the Order of Merit. She was made a citizen of honor of Berlin in 2018.",
      "Noting that there were few Holocaust survivors still alive, she told an audience that year: \u201cI would like you to be the witnesses we can\u2019t be for much longer.\u201d",

      "It was one of the sessions with students of the Pacelli School for the Blind and Partially Sighted, where Emeka Chuks Nnadi, the swimming coach, uses his Swim in 1 Day, or SID, nonprofit to teach swimming to disabled children.",
      "In a country where hundreds drown every year, often because of boat mishaps but sometimes as a result of domestic accidents, the initiative has so far taught at least 400 disabled people how to swim. It has also aided their personal development.",
      "\u201cIt (has) helped me a lot, especially in class,\u201d said 14-year-old Fikayo Adodo, one of Nnadi's trainees who is blind. \u201cI am very confident now to speak with a crowd, with people. My brain is sharper, like very great.\"",
      "The World Health Organization considers drowning as one of the leading causes of death through unintentional injury globally, with at least 300,000 people dying from drowning every year. The most at risk are young children.",

      "While the initiative is raising awareness among the children about drowning, it benefits wider society in different ways, Nnadi said, especially \u201cif you want to have disabled people that are contributing to the economy and not just dependent on us as a society to take care of them.\u201d",
      "Nnadi recalled setting up the nonprofit after moving back to Nigeria from Spain in 2022 and seeing how disabled people are treated compared to others. It was a wide gap, he said, and thought that teaching them how to swim at a young age would be a great way to improve their lives.",

      "Switzerland\u2019s president has lamented \u201cdisappointing\u201d talks with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s treasury secretary that did not ease stiff U.S. tariffs on Swiss goods",
      "GENEVA -- Switzerland's president lamented \u201cdisappointing\u201d talks Friday with U.S. President Donald Trump's treasury secretary that did not ease stiff U.S. tariffs on Swiss goods, but expressed hope for a solution to a more consequential U.S.-China face-off on tariffs in Geneva this weekend.",
      "Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, who also serves as finance minister, said she was nonetheless encouraged by the talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as Switzerland tries to wriggle out of hefty 31% U.S. tariffs of Swiss goods as part of Trump's sweeping \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on countries around the globe.",
      "Their meeting was only an appetizer for the potentially market-moving talks Saturday and Sunday between Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Geneva. Keller-Sutter also met with the Chinese envoy, but said it was merely a courtesy.",
      "As for the U.S.-China talks, the Swiss leader alluded to the election of the first U.S.-born pontiff, Pope Leo XIV, and quipped: \"I said to Secretary Bessent that apparently the Holy Spirit was in Rome yesterday, and I hope that he will come to Geneva over the weekend.\u201d",
      "The talks have been shrouded in secrecy and the Chinese and U.S. sides have declined to specify where they will take place other than somewhere in Geneva, which hosted U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2021 \u2014 before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "While the U.S. administration has temporarily suspended the most severe tariffs against every target country except China, the 31% rate \u2014 if restored \u2014 would put Switzerland in a worse position than its neighbors in the European Union, which are to face 20% U.S. tariffs on EU goods.",
      "The Swiss government said its talks Friday with Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer were \u201cconvivial and constructive\u201d and were aimed to lay out the guidelines for a deal on the issue of customs duties to be discussed again in coming weeks.",
      "On April 9 \u2014 a week after Trump announced the U.S. \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 he spoke with Keller-Sutter by phone and later announced a pause in their implementation for 90 days and capped the additional U.S. tariffs at 10% for most countries, with the notable exception of China.",
      "\u201cOf course, it is disappointing,\" Keller-Sutter said when asked about the lack of a deal in talks with Bessent, before alluding to her earlier phone conversation with Trump. \u201cI also told President Trump that this was not fair. But on the other hand, you know, I mean, we\u2019re not looking back, we are looking forward.\u201d",
      "\"And we\u2019re really encouraged by the talks we had that we\u2019re going to find a solution, and the U.S. side really engaged with Switzerland also to find a swift solution,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "Keller-Sutter trumpeted Swiss investment in the United States, saying it has created 400,000 jobs and \u201caverage salary $130,000, which is a lot\u201d in the United States. She said she didn't know whether her call with Trump on April 9 convinced him to ease back on the tariffs, before adding with a laugh: \u201cHe should listen to women.\u201d",
      "Going into the weekend talks between Bessent and He, the U.S. slapped 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, and Beijing has responded with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. Earlier Friday, Trump floated the prospect that those could be lowered sharply in a social media post.",
      "\u201c80% Tariff on China seems right!\" Trump wrote on his social media account, before alluding to Bessent. \"Up to Scott B.\u201d",

      "\u201cThese individuals have been stripped from their families and subject to a state-sponsored enforced disappearance regime, effectively, completely against the law,\u201d said Bella Mosselmans, director of the Global Strategic Litigation Council, which helped bring the suit. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this case might help put pressure on El Salvador to put basic guardrails in place.\u201d",
      "El Salvador has been living under a state of emergency for more than three years, which has suspended some fundamental rights and given the administration of President Nayib Bukele extraordinary powers. More than 85,000 Salvadorans have been arrested over the period for alleged ties to the country\u2019s once-powerful street gangs.",
      "The improvement in El Salvador\u2019s security has won Bukele widespread domestic support and some admirers in the region who seek to imitate his success. But the lack of due process and numerous arbitrary arrests have drawn international condemnation. Bukele has dismissed those critics as defenders of criminals.",
      "A spokesperson for Bukele's office declined to comment Friday.",
      "With the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump taking a hard line on immigration and portraying migrants broadly as criminals, neither government has been swayed by legal maneuvers in their own country to seek the men\u2019s release or return to the U.S.",
      "A judge in Washington this week said he would order the U.S. government to provide more information about its prison deal with El Salvador as he moved closer to requiring the government to return the men to the U.S.",
      "The human rights organizations hope that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights will accept this emergency petition. The commission is an arm of the regional Organization of American States. The groups presented the case on behalf of the families of 18 of the men sent to El Salvador, who provided sworn statements about their cases.",
      "Some of the men had pending asylum applications in the U.S., while others had been vetted and approved for refugee resettlement by the U.S. government, still others had temporary protected status allowing them to work in the U.S., according to the lawsuit.",
      "Bukele has said he has the room to hold the men and the payments from the U.S. will help cover the costs of his new prison.",
      "While both the Venezuelan government and nongovernmental organizations have filed habeas corpus petitions \u2014 essentially compelling the government to prove someone\u2019s detention was justified \u2014 in El Salvador\u2019s courts, none have advanced.",
      "The groups are asking the human right commission to order precautionary measures, basically an emergency action to prevent irreparable harm. Among them are the ability to communicate with their families, access to legal counsel and return to the United States. The commission would seek a response from El Salvador\u2019s government before making a decision, but is expected to move quickly.",
      "The other organizations involved in the lawsuit are the Boston University School of Law International Human Rights Clinic, the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. __",

      "Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., had revenues of $108.1 billion over the quarter, the company reported in a filing on Riyadh\u2019s Tadawul stock exchange. The company saw $107.2 billion in revenues and profits of $27.2 billion the same quarter last year.",

      "The announcement of Aramco\u2019s first-quarter results comes as the OPEC+ alliance has ramped up oil production. The oil cartel has agreed to boost output by 411,000 barrels per day next month, as uncertainty driven by U.S. tariffs has rippled through Middle Eastern markets.

      "Perhaps as much as ever, all eyes in the movie world will be on the 78th Cannes Film Festival when it gets underway Tuesday in the South of France",
      "Nowhere is the border-crossing nature of cinema more evident than the Cannes Film Festival, which kicks off Tuesday in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s vow to enact tariffs on international films.",
      "Cannes, where filmmakers, sales agents and journalists gather from around the world, is the Olympics of the big screen, with its own golden prize, the Palme d\u2019Or, to give out at the end. Filmmakers come from nearly every corner of the globe to showcase their films while dealmakers work through the night to sell finished films or packaged productions to various territories.",
      "\u201cYou release a film into that Colosseum-like situation,\u201d says Brazilian director Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, who\u2019s returning to Cannes with \u201cThe Secret Agent,\u201d a thriller set during Brazil\u2019s dictatorship. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to really prepare for the whole experience because it\u2019s quite intense \u2014 not very far from the feeling of approaching a roller coaster as you go up the steps at the Palais.\u201d",
      "Perhaps as much as ever, all eyes in the movie world will be on the 78th Cannes Film Festival when it gets underway this week. That\u2019s not just because of the long list of anticipated films set to premiere at the Cote d\u2019Azur festival (including films from Spike Lee, Wes Anderson, Lynne Ramsay, Richard Linklater and Ari Aster) and the extensive coterie of stars set to walk the fabled red carpet (Jennifer Lawrence, Denzel Washington, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart among them).",
      "As the movies, and the Oscar race, have grown more international, the global launchpad of Cannes has become only more central to the larger film ecosystem \u2014 even with the ongoing absence of Netflix. Recent editions of Cannes have produced a string of Academy Awards contenders, including this year\u2019s best-picture winner, \u201cAnora.\u201d",
      "At the same time, geopolitics course through Cannes unlike any other festival. The Cannes red carpet can be as much a platform for political protest as it is for glamour. This year\u2019s festival will include a dissident Iranian filmmaker (Jafar Panahi), a Ukrainian filmmaker (Sergei Loznitsa) and the first Nigerian production in the official selection (Akinola Davies Jr.'s \u201cMy Father's Shadow\u201d).",
      "In the run-up to the festival, three filmmakers from different corners of the world spoke about their roads to the Cannes competition lineup. For many directors, reaching the Cannes competition \u2014 this year, that's 22 movies vying for the Palme d'Or \u2014 is career milestone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meaningful for me. It\u2019s meaningful for the country,\u201d says Oliver Hermanus, speaking from outside Cape Town. Hermanus, the South African filmmaker of \u201cMoffie\u201d and \u201cLiving,\u201d is in competition for the first time with \u201cThe History of Sound,\u201d a period love story starring Paul Mescal and Josh O\u2019Connor.",
      "\u201cI was born here and made movies here for most of my career, so I still see myself as a South African filmmaker who\u2019s interested in the South African perspective on things and South African representation,\u201d adds Hermanus. \u201cThe competition is something I\u2019ve always wanted to be part of.\u201d",
      "Chie Hayakawa, the Japanese filmmaker of 2022's \u201cPlan 75,\u201d is also in competition for the first time. She first came to Cannes with a student film that she never expected to make it into the festival\u2019s shorts program. This week, she\u2019ll debut \u201cRenoir,\u201d a semiautobiographical tale about an 11-year-old girl with a father who has terminal cancer.",
      "\u201cIt gives me a huge encouragement and keeps me motivated to making films,\u201d Hayakawa said from Tokyo. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to compete with other films. But it meaningful. I know how prestigious and meaningful it is to be in competition.\u201d",
      "\u201cFilm is global and easily crosses the borders of any country or culture,\u201d she adds. \u201cThat\u2019s what special about Cannes.\u201d",
      "Cannes' global approach is part of what makes this year more complicated than usual. Trump sent shock waves through Hollywood and the international film community when he announced on May 4 that all movies \u201cproduced in Foreign Lands\u201d will face 100% tariffs.",
      "The White House has said no final decisions have been made. Options being explored include federal incentives for U.S.-based productions, rather than tariffs. But the announcement was a reminder of how international tensions can destabilize even the oldest cultural institutions.",
      "Filho first attended Cannes as a critic. Once he began making movies, the allure of the festival remained. To him, participating in Cannes means joining a timeline of cinema history. \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d marks his third time in competition.",
      "\u201cI have always felt that there was a seriousness that I appreciated,\u201d Filho says. \u201cFor example, I will be attending a 2 a.m. test for sound and picture. This is done with scientist types who will take care of the projection and how everything will go.\u201d",
      "As to the threat of tariffs? He shrugs.",
      "\u201cI have been trained by Brazil, because we had a very strange and weird historic moment under (former president Jair) Bolsonaro,\u201d Filho said. \u201cI used my training to say: This is probably some bad idea or misunderstanding that will be corrected in the coming days or weeks. Even for leaders like them, Bolsonaro and Trump, it makes no sense whatsoever.\u201d",
      "The Cannes Film Festival originally emerged in the World War II years, when the rise of fascism in Italy led to the founding of an alternative to the then-government controlled Venice Film Festival. In the time since, Cannes\u2019 resolute commitment to cinema has made it a beacon to filmmakers. Countless directors have come to make their name.",
      "This year is no different, though some of the first-time filmmakers at Cannes are already particularly well-known. Stewart (\u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d), Scarlett Johansson (\u201cEleanor the Great\u201d) and Harris Dickinson (\u201cUrchin\u201d) will all be unveiling their feature directorial debuts in Cannes\u2019 Un Certain Regard sidebar section.",
      "Many Cannes veterans will be back, too, including Tom Cruise (\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning\u201d), Robert De Niro (who\u2019s to receive an honorary Palme d\u2019Or 49 years after \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d premiered in Cannes) and Quentin Tarantino (to pay tribute to low-budget Western director George Sherman).",
      "Hermanus first came to Cannes with his 2011 film \u201cBeauty.\u201d He went naively optimistic before realizing, he laughs, that a Cannes selection is \u201ca potential invitation to a beheading.",
      "\u201cEven going now with \u2018The History of Sound,\u2019 I\u2019m trying to be realistic about the fact that it\u2019s a gladiatorial arena. It\u2019s everything to lose and everything to gain,\u201d says Hermanus. \u201cWhen Cannes selected us, it came down to me and Paul going, \u2018Oh God, here comes the real stress. Will we survive the intensity of Cannes?\u2019 \u2014 which we both agreed is the reason to go.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- At the biggest jewelry center in the United States, Alberto Hernandez fired up his machine on a recent day and waited until it glowed bright orange inside before shoveling in an assortment of rings, earrings and necklaces weighing about as much as a bar of soap: just under 100 grams, or 3.2 troy ounces.",
      "Minutes later, the bubbling liquid metal was cooling in a rectangular cast the size of a woman's shoe. An X-ray machine determined it was 56.5% gold, making it worth $177,000 based on the price of gold that day.",
      "As gold prices soar to record highs during global economic jitters, hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of gold are circulating through the doors of St. Vincent Jewelry Center in downtown Los Angeles on any given day.",
      "Many of the center\u2019s 500 independent tenants, which include jewelers, gold refiners and assayers, say they have never seen such a surge in customers.",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re seeing a lot of rappers and stuff melting their big pieces,\u201d said Alberto\u2019s nephew, Sabashden Hernandez, who works at A&M Precious Metals. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of new customers who are just getting all of their grandfather\u2019s stuff, melting it down pretty much.\u201d",
      "Gold\u2019s current rally comes as President Donald Trump issues ever-changing announcements on tariffs, roiling financial markets and threatening to reignite inflation.",
      "In response, people across the country are flocking to sell or melt down their old jewelry for quick cash, including middlemen like pawn shop owners. Others, thinking their money might be safer in gold than in the volatile stock market, are snapping it up just as fast.",
      "Los Angeles jeweler Olivia Kazanjian said people are even bringing in family heirlooms.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re melting things with their family\u2019s wedding dates and things from the 1800s,\u201d Kazanjian said.",
      "She recently paid a client for a 14-karat gold woven bracelet with intricate blue enamel work that could be turned into a brooch. The customer walked away with $3,200 for the amount of gold contained in the piece measured in troy ounces, the standard for precious metals equivalent to 31 grams.",
      "But Kazanjian doesn't plan to melt the piece. The real artistic and historical value was a lot more, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just stunning \u2026 and you won\u2019t see that kind of craftsmanship again,\u201d Kazanjian said, adding she has persuaded some customers to change their minds about melting items. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of history, and if you\u2019re lucky enough to inherit it, it\u2019s a piece of your family.\"",
      "Businesses on the sales side of the action, offering gold bars and other material, also are working hard to keep up with the frenzy.",
      "\u201cStuff comes in and it goes right out,\u201d said Edwin Feijoo, who owns Stefko Cash for Gold in Pennsylvania and receives shipments from customers across the U.S. looking to sell their gold. \u201cEverybody\u2019s busy right now.\u201d",
      "Business hasn't been good for everyone, though.",
      "For some jewelers who source their products from places abroad like Italy, Turkey and China, the combination of high gold prices and added tariffs have cut into profit margins and hurt demand.",
      "\u201cOur profit margins are so razor thin here,\u201d said Puzant Berberian, whose family founded V&P Jewelry inside St. Vincent in 1983. Berberian said he recently paid an extra $16,000 on a package from overseas.",
      "Customers also are feeling \u201csticker shock\u201d when they can't afford the things they used to. A chunky, 14-karat gold bracelet weighing about 10 grams (0.32 troy ounces) might have sold for around $600 last year, but now it\u2019s closer to $900, Berberian said.",
      "Some believe those trends could continue, both for consumers and businesses.",
      "Customers hoping to buy bullion \u201cthink gold will go up\u201d even more, according to Sam Nguyen, whose business, Newport Gold Post Inc., has bought and sold gold and other precious metals at St. Vincent for five years. While gold has cooled from its record high of $3,500 per troy ounce, Nguyen thinks it could reach $4,000 to $5,000 by year\u2019s end.",

      "Is it the party that promotes free-market prosperity or a 21st-century populism?",
      "Does it stick with the \u201cNo new taxes\u201d pledge that has been GOP political orthodoxy for decades or do Republicans tax the rich, as President Donald Trump suggests?",

      "Slash deficit spending or spike the nation\u2019s now $36 trillion debt load?",
      "Free trade or Trump\u2019s tariffs?",

      "It\u2019s still a work in progress.",
      "\u201cThis idea of the American dream where we are the best country in the world \u2014 which I believe we are \u2013 will be gone and it\u2019ll be our fault, so we have to do something right now to address it,\u201d said Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga.",
      "\u201cAnd everybody wants to say, \u2018Oh, yeah, we should do something,\u2019 but nobody\u2019s willing to say what that hard choice is.\u201d",
      "The GOP is shape-shifting its economic policy priorities in real time, transforming from a party that once put a premium on lower taxes and smaller government into something more reflective of the interests of the working-class coalition that depends on the federal safety net and put Trump in the White House.",
      "On the one side, there\u2019s the old-school Republican stalwarts who have guided policy thinking for years. Among them are former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who says tax increases would be \u201cstupid, destructive\u201d and the influential Club for Growth, which pours millions into political campaigns.",
      "But a rising neo-populist power center with proximity to Trump carries clout, with Steve Banon and others who reject the traditional trickle-down economic policies and propose a new direction that more benefits Americans.",
      "Divisions run strong within the Republican Party, which holds the majority on Capitol Hill, and is bulldozing past Democratic objections to push its package forward on its own. GOP lawmakers are under mounting pressure to set aside their differences by Johnson's Memorial Day deadline, especially as Trump\u2019s tariffs stoke unease, and they are eager to signal that the economy is under control on their watch.",

      "Moderate conservative Republicans in the House have signed on to letters opposing steep cuts to Medicaid, which provides health care to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "The Medicaid program has expanded in the 15 years since the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, became law, as more states signed up for federal cost-sharing allotments, and people benefited from enhanced federal credits to pay their insurance premiums. Republicans who pledged to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the health law during Trump's first term are now insisting they only want to target what they say is waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, as many fight to save its more popular parts.",
      "Many of those same moderate GOP lawmakers also oppose rolling back the green energy tax breaks that Democrats approved under Biden as companies invest in wind, solar and other renewable energy development.",
      "At the same time, the more conservative Republicans are roaring back, insisting on deep cuts.",
      "Some 30 Republicans said the party must hold to the original GOP budget framework of up to $2 trillion in spending cuts, which they argue are needed to prevent the tax cuts from piling on annual deficits that are fueling the nation's debt load. The cost of the tax cuts, first approved by Republicans in 2017, during Trump's first term, is expected to grow if Republicans add other priorities, including no taxes on tipped wages or Social Security income. Estimates put the final costs beyond $7 trillion.",

    "summary": "A female business owner in Uganda wanted to create a coffee sisterhood",
    "story": [
      "A female business owner in Uganda wanted to create a coffee sisterhood",
      "SIRONKO, Uganda -- Meridah Nandudu envisioned a coffee sisterhood in Uganda, and the strategy for expanding it was simple: Pay a higher price per kilogram when a female grower took the beans to a collection point.",
      "It worked. More and more men who typically made the deliveries allowed their wives to go instead.",
      "Nandudu\u2019s business group now includes more than 600 women, up from dozens in 2022. That\u2019s about 75% of her Bayaaya Specialty Coffee\u2019s pool of registered farmers in this mountainous area of eastern Uganda that produces prized arabica beans and sells to exporters.",
      "\u201cWomen have been so discouraged by coffee in a way that, when you look at (the) coffee value chain, women do the donkey work,\u201d Nandudu said. But when the coffee is ready for selling, men step in to claim the proceeds.",
      "Her goal is to reverse that trend in a community where coffee production is not possible without women's labor.",
      "Uganda is one of Africa\u2019s top two coffee producers, and the crop is its leading export. The east African country exported more than 6 million bags of coffee between September 2023 and August 2024, accounting for $1.3 billion in earnings, according to the Uganda Coffee Development Authority.",
      "The earnings have been rising as production dwindles in Brazil, the world\u2019s top coffee producer, which faces unfavorable drought conditions.",
      "In Sironko district, where Nandudu grew up in a remote village near the Kenya border, coffee is the community's lifeblood. As a girl, when she was not at school, she helped her mother and other women look after acres of coffee plants. They usually planted, weeded and toiled with the post-harvest routine that includes pulping, fermenting, washing and drying the coffee.",
      "The harvest season was known to coincide with a surge in cases of domestic violence, she said. Couples fought over how much of the earnings that men brought home from sales \u2014 and how much they didn't.",
      "\u201cWhen (men) go and sell, they are not accountable. Our mothers cannot ask, \u2018We don\u2019t have food at home. You sold coffee. Can you pay school fees for this child?\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Years later, Nandudu earned her degree in the social sciences from Uganda\u2019s top public university in 2015, with her father funding her education from coffee earnings. She had the idea to launch a company that would prioritize the needs of coffee-producing women in the country's conservative society.",
      "She thought of her project as a kind of sisterhood and chose \u201cbayaaya\" \u2014 a translation in the Lumasaba language \u2014 for her company's name.",
      "It launched in 2018, operating like others that buy coffee directly from farmers and process it for export.",
      "But Bayaaya is unique in Mbale, the largest city in eastern Uganda, for focusing on women and for initiatives such as a cooperative saving society that members can contribute to and borrow from.",
      "For small-holder Ugandan farmers in remote areas, a small movement in the price of a kilogram of coffee is a major event. The decision to sell to one or another middleman often hinges on small price differences.",
      "A decade ago, the price of coffee bought by a middleman from a Ugandan farmer was roughly 8,000 Uganda shillings, or just over $2 at today\u2019s exchange rate. Now the price is roughly $5.",
      "Nandudu adds an extra 200 shillings to the price of every kilogram she buys from a woman. It\u2019s enough of an incentive that more women are joining. Another benefit is a small bonus payment during the off-season from February to August.",
      "That motivates many local men \u201cto trust their women to sell coffee,\u201d Nandudu said. \u201cWhen a woman sells coffee, she has a hand in it.\u201d",
      "Nandudu\u2019s group has many collection points across eastern Uganda, and women trek to them at least twice a week. Men are not turned away.",
      "Selling as a Bayaaya member has fostered teamwork as her family collectively decides how to spend coffee earnings, said Linet Gimono, who joined the group in 2022.",
      "And with assured earnings, she\u2019s able to afford the \"small things\u201d she often needs as a woman. \u201cI can buy soap (and) I can buy sugar without pulling ropes with my husband over it,\u201d she said.",
      "Another member, Juliet Kwaga, said her mother never would have thought of collecting coffee earnings because her father was very much in charge.",
      "Now, Kwaga's husband, with a bit of encouragement, is comfortable sending her. \u201cAt the end of the day I go home with something to feed my family, to support my children,\" she said.",
      "In Sironko district, home to more than 200,000 people, coffee trees dot the hilly terrain. Much of the farming is on plots of one or two acres, although some families have larger tracts.",
      "Many farmers don\u2019t usually drink coffee, and some have never tasted it. Some women smiled in embarrassment when asked what it tasted like.",
      "But things are slowly changing. Routine coffee drinkers are emerging among younger women in the coffee business in urban areas, including at a roasting place in Mbale where most employees are women.",
      "Phoebe Nabutale, who helps oversee quality assurance for Darling Coffee, was raised in a family of coffee growers. She bent over the roaster, smelling the beans until she got the aroma she wanted.",
      "Many of her girlfriends, she said, regularly ask how they can break into the coffee business, as roasters or otherwise.",
      "For Nandudu, who aims to start exporting beans, that's progress.",
      "Now there are more women in \u201ccoffee as a business,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Norwegian company Equinor says it will be forced to terminate an offshore wind project for New York within days unless the Trump administration lets construction resume",
      "The Norwegian energy company Equinor said Friday it will be forced to terminate an offshore wind project for New York within days unless President Donald Trump 's administration relents on its order that stopped construction.",
      "Work on Empire Wind has been paused since April 16, when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to halt construction. Burgum said it needs further review because it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval. Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year, and the project is roughly a third complete.",
      "Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and has signed a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. His first day in office, Trump signed an executive order temporarily halting offshore wind lease sales in federal waters and pausing the issuance of approvals, permits and loans for all wind projects.",
      "Empire Wind is fully permitted and the developer has already invested more than $2.5 billion so far in the project, said Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables Americas, in an interview Friday.",
      "She said this is an \u201curgent, unsustainable situation\u201d because each day of uncertainty is extremely expensive: Equinor spends up to $50 million per week on the project and has 11 vessels on standby. The developer has done a significant amount of onshore work already, where the cable from the wind farm will connect to the local grid.",
      "\u201cIf no material progress is made toward a resolution within days, Equinor will be forced to terminate the project,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about honoring contracts and financial investments made in the U.S. It could set a dangerous precedent by stopping a project in mid-execution.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Equinor has over $60 billion in investments across the U.S., including substantial oil, gas and renewable projects. RWE, a German energy company, has stopped its offshore wind work in the United States, citing the political environment. French energy giant TotalEnergies paused the development of its offshore wind project in New York after Trump won reelection.",
      "Equinor is considering legal options, but rather than getting tied up in the courts, Morris said the best way forward is a quicker political resolution. The summer construction window for major offshore work began this month, and missing it would set the project back a year, she said.",
      "Morris and Equinor CEO Anders Opedal met with Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, on Wednesday. She said it was helpful, but they've asked to meet with Burgum and haven't gotten a meeting.",
      "Equinor is building Empire Wind to start providing power in 2026 for more than 500,000 New York homes. Equinor finalized the federal lease for Empire Wind in March 2017, early in Trump\u2019s first term. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management approved the construction and operations plan in February 2024 and construction began that year.",
      "New York is leading a coalition of state attorneys general challenging the wind energy executive order in court. They say in the lawsuit filed Monday that Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he\u2019s jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states\u2019 economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.",
      "The White House says Democratic attorneys general are trying to stop the president\u2019s popular energy agenda instead of working with him to restore America\u2019s energy dominance.",

      "Airbnb and Hilton noted the same trends last week in their quarterly earnings reports. Most major U.S. airlines pulled their full-year financial guidance in April and said they planned to reduce scheduled flights, citing an ebb in economy passengers booking leisure trips.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association has said that economic uncertainty and anxiety over President Donald Trump's tariffs may explain the pullback. In April, Americans\u2019 confidence in the economy slumped for a fifth straight month to the lowest level since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Abroad, anger about the tariffs as well as concern about tourist detentions at the U.S. border have made citizens of some other countries less interested in traveling to the U.S., tourism industry experts say.",

      "Expedia Chief Financial Officer Scott Schenkel said the net value of the travel technology company's bookings into the U.S. fell 7% in the January-March period, but bookings to the U.S. from Canada were down nearly 30%.",
      "In a conference call with investors Friday, Expedia CEO Ariane Gorin said U.S. demand was even softer in April than March.",

      "Hilton President and CEO Christopher Nassetta told stock analysts the company saw international travel to its U.S. hotels fall throughout the first quarter, particularly from Canada and Mexico.",

      "Toy dolls have become the latest rhetorical poster child for President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade has taken aim at a number of foreign goods, from European wines and car parts from Mexico to films made abroad. Lately, the president's wandering ire has found another rhetorical poster child: toy dolls.",
      "Trump asserted that children will be fine having two dolls \u2014 perhaps three or five \u2014 instead of 30 if U.S. import taxes increase consumer prices. The response on social media included memes of him portrayed as the Grinch and photos of a young Barron Trump\u2019s child-sized Mercedes convertible.",
      "\u201cCOMPLETELY out of touch,\" The Loyal Subjects CEO Jonathan Cathey, whose collectible toy company in Los Angeles produces Strawberry Shortcake and Rainbow Brite dolls, wrote on Linkedin. \"If that ain\u2019t a \u2018Let them eat cake\u2019 moment shot through the echoes of history? Love how toys and dolls have become THE martyr metaphor for this nonsensical trade war incoherence.\u201d",
      "The president's comments also touched a nerve with parents, both ones who took offense at the casual way he hypothesized that perhaps \u201ctwo dolls will cost a couple bucks more\u201d and those who acknowledged their own kids have more toys than they need.",
      "Either way, the U.S. toy industry has a lot riding on a possible deescalation of the tariff standoff between the Trump administration and the government in Beijing. Nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. come from China.",
      "The Toy Association, a trade group, has lobbied for an immediate reprieve from the 145% tariff rate the president put on Chinese-made products. Some toy companies warn the likelihood of holiday shortages increases each week the tariff remains in effect.",
      "Here's a snapshot of the doll debate and how tariffs are impacting toys:",
      "From Barbie, Bratz and Cabbage Patch Kids to Adora baby dolls, American Girl and Our Generation, dolls are a big business in the U.S. as well as beloved playthings.",
      "The doll category, which includes accessories like clothes, generated U.S. sales of $2.7 billion last year compared to $2.9 billion in 2023 and $3.4 billion in 2019, according to market research firm Circana.",
      "Consumers splurged on toys during the height of the COVID pandemic to keep children and themselves occupied, but sales flattened as inflation seized the economy.",
      "Younger girls becoming more interested in buying makeup and skincare also has cooled the demand for dolls, Marshal Cohen, Circana's chief retail advisor, said.",
      "The nation's largest toy maker, Mattel, said this week it would have to raise prices for some products sold in the U.S. to offset higher costs related to tariffs.",
      "The company, whose brands include Barbie and American Girl, said the increases were necessary even though it\u2019s speeding up the expansion of its manufacturing base outside of China.",
      "Smaller toy companies are expected to have a harder time than Mattel and Hasbro, which makes the eating, drinking and diaper-wetting Baby Alive. Cathey said he paused The Loyal Subjects' shipments from China in April because he couldn't pay the stratospheric tariff they would have incurred.",
      "\u201cNobody insulates themselves with that much cash,\u201d he said.",
      "With about four months' worth of inventory on hand, Cathey said his ability to secure holiday stock depends on a break in the U.S.-China trade standoff happening in the next two weeks since it would take time for cargo operations to resume.",
      "Cepia, a Missouri company that was behind the 2009 holiday season hit Zhu Zhu Pets, launched a line of 11-inch fashion dolls called Decora Girlz last year. CEO James Russell Hornsby said he was working to relocate some production but the move won't happen in time to replace the orders he planned to get from China.",
      "Hornsby described himself as a Trump supporter and said he understands the administration's desire to reduce trade imbalances.",
      "\u201cLet's just get the deals done and stop all this because (Trump's) disrupting Christmas,\u201d he said.",
      "Although American Girl launched in 1986 with a line based on fictional historical characters, the dolls never were domestic products. They were made in Germany before production eventually moved to China.",
      "Toy experts say that in addition to lower costs, Chinese factories have developed techniques and expertise that are not easily replicated.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any capacity in the U.S. to make rooted doll hair. And then you\u2019ve got things like the faces. Some of them are hand-painted, others are done with a Tampo (printing) machine,\u201d James Zahn, editor-in-chief of industry publication The Toy Book, said of doll-making.",
      "Hornsby said rooting the synthetic hair onto the heads of Decora Girlz dolls is carried out by skilled workers at factories in Guangzhou and Dongguan, China.",
      "\u201cIt's not just sticking into a machine and it automatically does it,\" he said. \u201dYou have to know what you\u2019re doing in order to make that doll look like it\u2019s got a full set of hair when literally maybe only 60% of the head is filled with hair.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said last week that he assumes consumers would prefer to pay more for American-made products. Dolls made in China might have lead paint in them, he said.",
      "Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said the picture is more complicated.",
      "Products for children ages 12 and under require third-party testing and certification from labs approved by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing lead levels in toys, Murray said.",
      "The rules apply to all products sold in the U.S. Toys by major brands such as Fisher-Price, Mattel, Hasbro and Lego, which have long outsourced manufacturing to China, are usually in compliance, she said.",
      "But the rise of online shopping, including e-commerce platforms that ship directly to U.S. consumers from overseas, has posed a challenge, according to Murray. When valued at less than $800, such parcels entered the U.S. duty-free and were not subject to the same scrutiny as bulk imports, she said.",
      "The White House eliminated the customs exemption starting May 2 for low-value parcels that originated in mainland China and Hong Kong. U.S Customs and Border Protection expects additional oversight will make it easier to flag problems.",
      "Toy companies and industry experts argue the high tariffs on Chinese imports will tempt price-sensitive shoppers to search for cheap counterfeit toys that carry higher safety risks.",
      "Plenty of people agree American consumer culture has gotten out of hand, in large part due to prices kept low through the labor of foreign factory workers who earn much less than they would in the U.S.",

      "\u201cI think it is a small view of what purchase habits and realities are for people who buy toys for kids,\u201d Walley-Wiegert said.",
      "San Francisco resident Elenor Mak, who founded the Jilly Bing doll company after she couldn't find an Asian American doll for her daughter, Jillian, now 5, said the president's remarks upset her because some families struggle to buy even one doll.",

      "The air traffic controllers directing planes into the Newark, New Jersey, airport lost their radar Friday morning for the second time in two weeks",
      "The air traffic controllers directing planes into the Newark, New Jersey, airport briefly lost their radar Friday morning for the second time in two weeks, renewing concerns about the nation's aging air traffic control system that President Donald Trump wants to overhaul.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said the radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3:55 a.m. Friday. That\u2019s similar to what happened on April 28.",
      "That first radar outage led to hundreds of flights being canceled or delayed at the Newark airport in the past two weeks after the FAA slowed down traffic at the airport to ensure safety. Five controllers also went on trauma leave after that outage, worsening the existing shortage. It\u2019s not clear if any additional controllers will go on leave now.",
      "The number of cancellations and delays spiked after the FAA limited traffic at Newark and has remained high since then. The FAA plans to talk with all the airlines that fly out of Newark about cutting their schedules while the staffing and technology issues persist.",
      "The number of cancellations Friday morning was down around 40 departures and arrivals, but increased after the radar outage and a disruption related to ongoing runway construction. By the end of the day 68 departures and arrivals had been canceled in Newark, and more than 400 delays were reported.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Friday that the \u201cglitch this morning at Newark\u201d was caused by the same issues as last week.",
      "The latest Newark problems reinforce the need for the multi-billion-dollar plan Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Thursday to replace the nation\u2019s aging air traffic control system, Leavitt said. The plan is designed to prevent such problems from happening and give controllers modern technology. More than 4,600 new high-speed connections would be installed and 618 radars would be replaced across the country.",
      "Officials developed the plan to upgrade the system after a deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter killed 67 people in the skies over Washington, D.C. Several other crashes this year also put pressure on officials to act.",
      "But the shortcomings of the air traffic control system have been known for decades. The National Transportation Safety Board has not determined that a problem with the air traffic control system caused that crash near Reagan National Airport.",
      "These radar outages in such a crowded airspace are alarming because seconds matter, but Allied Pilots Association spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said \u201cit\u2019s not an impending disaster that some are suggesting.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe system is wired to run really well when everything\u2019s functioning. But the most important part is that it\u2019s prepared to function when things go wrong,\u201d Tajer said. \u201cEven when it sounds frightening, know that the air traffic controllers and the pilots have training and we go to that.\u201d",
      "When pilots lose contact with controllers their first action is to continue on their last-directed path, but if the outage continues, pilots will start broadcasting their position to every other plane in the area \u2014 much like pilots do at small airports that don\u2019t have a control tower.",
      "U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer blamed the problems that have plagued Newark on the lack of proper air traffic controller staffing and modern technology. He said at a news conference Friday that there are currently about 20 controllers working, and that number should be in the 60s. And many of the lines connecting controllers to the radar are outdated copper wires. He said the April 28 outage was caused by one of those copper wires getting fried.",
      "\u201cOur region is a key economic artery for our country. Yet this region... one of the busiest air spaces in the world, as I mentioned, is running off a tower that\u2019s full of copper wire dating back to the 1980s with outdated and inefficient technology. And the region is short \u2014 and this is a big deal. The region is short about 40 air traffic controllers,\u201d Gottheimer said. He said the tower was built back in \u201cthe Brady Bunch era\u201d in 1973.",

      "The way President Donald Trump sees it, beating China in a trade war should be easy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The way President Donald Trump sees it, beating China in a trade war should be easy.",
      "After all, his logic goes, the Chinese sell Americans three times as much stuff as Americans sell them. Therefore, they have more to lose. Inflict enough pain, like the combined 145% taxes he slapped on Chinese imports last month, and they\u2019ll beg for mercy.",
      "Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent has confidently compared Beijing to a card player stuck with a losing hand. \u201cThey\u2019re playing with a pair of twos,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Somebody forgot to tell China. So far, the Chinese have refused to fold under the pressure of Trump\u2019s massive tariffs. Instead, they have retaliated with triple-digit tariffs of their own.",
      "\u201cAll bullies are just paper tigers,\u2019\u2019 the Chinese Foreign Ministry declared in a video last week. \u201cKneeling only invites more bullying.\u2019\u2019",
      "The stakes are high between the world\u2019s two biggest economies whose trade topped $660 billion last year. Bessent and Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, are heading to Geneva this weekend for initial trade talks with top Chinese officials. Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \u201c80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "While businesses and investors welcome any easing of tensions, the prospects for a quick and significant breakthrough appear dim.",
      "\u201cThese are talks about talks, and China may be coming to assess what\u2019s on the table \u2014 or even just to buy time,\u201d said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cThere\u2019s no shared roadmap or clear pathway to de-escalation.\u201d",
      "But if the two countries eventually agree to scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they have slapped on each other\u2019s goods, it would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "\u201cThe companies involved in this trade on both sides just cannot afford waiting anymore,\u201d said economist John Gong of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. In a worst-case scenario, China could walk away from the negotiations if it feels the U.S. side isn\u2019t treating China as an equal or isn\u2019t willing to take the first step to deescalate, Gong said.",
      "\u201cI think if (Bessent) doesn\u2019t go into this negotiation with this kind of mindset, this could be very difficult,\u201d he said.",
      "For now, the two countries can\u2019t even agree on who requested the talks. \u201cThe meeting is being held at the request of the U.S. side,\u2019\u2019 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Wednesday. Trump disagreed. \u201cThey ought to go back and study their files,\u201d he said.",
      "What seems clear is that Trump\u2019s favorite economic weapon \u2014 import taxes, or tariffs \u2014 has not proved as mighty as he\u2019d hoped.",
      "\u201cFor Trump, what\u2019s happened here is that the rhetoric of his campaign has finally had to face economic reality,\u201d said Jeff Moon, a trade official in the Obama administration who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy. \u201cThe idea that he was going to bring China to its knees in terms of tariffs was never going to work.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump views tariffs an all-purpose economic tool that can raise money for the U.S. Treasury, protect American industries, lure factories to the United States and pressure other countries to bend to his will, even on issues such as immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "He used tariffs in his first term and has been even more aggressive and unpredictable about imposing them in his second. He\u2019s slapped a 10% tariff on almost every country in the world, blowing up the rules that had governed global trade for decades.",
      "But it\u2019s his trade war with China that has really put markets and businesses on edge. It started in February when he announced a 10% levy on Chinese imports. By April, Trump ratcheted up the taxes on China to a staggering 145%. Beijing upped its tariff on American products to 125%.",
      "Trump\u2019s escalation sent financial markets tumbling and left U.S. retailers warning that they might run out of goods as U.S.-China trade implodes. U.S. consumers, worried about the prospect of empty shelves and higher prices, are losing confidence in the economy.",
      "\u201cThis was not very well planned,\u2019\u2019 said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, senior fellow in China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cI don\u2019t think he intended to have the tariffs escalate into this chaos.\u2019\u2019",
      "When Trump hit Chinese imports with tariffs during his first term, he charged that Beijing used unfair tactics, including cybertheft, to give its technology firms an edge.",
      "The two countries reached a truce \u2014 the so-called Phase One agreement \u2014 in January 2020; China agreed to buy more U.S. products, and Trump held off on even higher tariffs. But they didn\u2019t resolve the big issues dividing them, including China\u2019s subsidies of homegrown tech firms.",
      "China was ready for a rematch when Trump returned to the White House. It had worked to reduce its dependence on America\u2019s massive market, cutting the U.S. share of its exports to 15% last year from more than 19% in 2018, according to Dexter Roberts of the Atlantic Council.",
      "Beijing is confident that the Chinese people are more willing than Americans to endure the fallout from a trade war, including falling exports and shuttered factories. \u201cFor China, it\u2019s painful, but it\u2019s also imperative to withstand it, and it\u2019s prepared to cope with it,\u2019\u2019 said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center.",
      "In addition to miscalculating Chinese resolve, the Trump administration may have underestimated how much America relies on China.",
      "For decades, Americans have come to depend on Chinese factories. They produce 97% of America\u2019s imported baby carriages, 96% of its artificial flowers and umbrellas, 95% of its fireworks, 93% of its children\u2019s coloring books and 90% of its combs.",
      "\u201cWithout us, what do they have to sell?\u201d Chinese toymaker Cheng Zhengren told Beijing News. \u201cTheir shelves would be empty.\u201d",
      "The showerhead company Afina last month reported on an experiment suggesting that American consumers have little willingness to pay more for American-made products. Afina makes a filtered showerhead in China and Vietnam that retails for $129. Making the same product in America would lift the price to $239. When customers on the company\u2019s website were given a choice between them, 584 chose the cheap Asian one; not one opted for the costlier U.S.-made version.",
      "And it\u2019s not just consumers who depend on China. America\u2019s own factories do, too. The National Association of Manufacturers calculates 47% of U.S. imports from China in 2023 were \u201cmanufacturing inputs\u2019\u2019 \u2014 industrial supplies, auto parts and capital equipment that American manufacturers used to make other their own products domestically. So Trump\u2019s tariffs risk raising costs and reducing supplies that U.S. factories rely on, making them less competitive.",
      "Louise Loo, China economist at Oxford Economics, a consulting firm, said that China\u2019s ability to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market in recent years means \u201cthey\u2019re probably likely to be able to find substitutes for buyers, much easier than the U.S. side will be able to find suppliers.\u201d",
      "Still, China won\u2019t emerge from a trade war unscathed either. Citing the impact of the trade war, the International Monetary Fund last month downgraded the outlook for the Chinese economy this year and next.",
      "\u201cChina needs the United States of America,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Friday\u2019s news briefing. \u201cThey need our markets. They need our consumer base. And Secretary Bessent knows that he\u2019s going to Switzerland this weekend with the full support and confidence and trust of the president here at home.\u201d",
      "Indeed Moon, who also served as a diplomat in China, noted the tariffs cut both ways: \u201cBoth of them are highly dependent on bilateral trade. They have put themselves in a corner.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jens Eskelund, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, expressed relief that U.S. and Chinese officials were meeting.",
      "\u201cSo good,\u2019\u2019 he said, pointing to the Vatican conclave that just picked a new pope as inspiration. \u201cLock them in a room and then hopefully white smoke will come out.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Commercial fishermen are eager to see if President Donald Trump's command to shed federal fishing regulations will boost one of the nation's oldest industries",
      "STONINGTON, Maine -- Virginia Olsen has pulled lobsters from Maine's chilly Atlantic waters for decades while watching threats to the state's lifeblood industry mount.",
      "Trade imbalances with Canada, tight regulations on fisheries and offshore wind farms towering like skyscrapers on open water pose three of those threats, said Olsen, part of the fifth generation in her family to make a living in the lobster trade.",
      "That's why she was encouraged last month when President Donald Trump signed an executive order that promises to restore American fisheries to their former glory. The order promises to shred fishing regulations, and Olsen said that will allow fishermen to do what they do best \u2014 fish.",
      "That will make a huge difference in communities like her home of Stonington, the busiest lobster fishing port in the country, Olsen said. It's a tiny island town of winding streets, swooping gulls and mansard roof houses with an economy almost entirely dependent on commercial fishing, some three hours up the coast from Portland, Maine's biggest city.",
      "Olsen knows firsthand how much has changed over the years. Hundreds of fish and shellfish populations globally have dwindled to dangerously low levels, alarming scientists and prompting the restrictions and catch limits that Trump's order could wash away with the stroke of a pen. But she's heartened that the livelihoods of people who work the traps and cast the nets have become a priority in faraway places where they often felt their voices weren't heard.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s time to have the conversation on what regulations that the industry does need. We\u2019re fishing different than we did 100 years ago,\" she said. \u201cIf everything is being looked at, we should be looking at the regulations within the fishing industry.\u201d",
      "But if fishing and lobstering interests finally have a seat at the table, the questions become how much seafood can be served there \u2014 and for how long. Trump's April 17 order, called \u201cRestoring American Seafood Competitiveness,\u201d promises an overhaul of the way America fishes, and cites a national seafood trade deficit of more than $20 billion as the reason to do it. The order calls on the federal government to reduce the regulatory burden on fishermen by later this month.",
      "It arrives at a time when conservation groups and many marine scientists say the ocean needs more regulation, not less. One oft-cited 2020 study led by a scientist at the University of British Columbia looked at more than 1,300 fish and invertebrate populations and found that 82% were below levels that can produce maximum sustainable yields. The university said the study \u201cdiscovered global declines, some severe, of many popularly consumed species.\u201d",
      "Trump's order prioritizes commerce over conservation. It also calls for the development of a comprehensive seafood trade strategy and a review of existing marine monuments, which are underwater protected zones, to see if any should be opened for fishing. At least one, the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument, has already been reopened.",
      "Many commercial fishermen and fishing trade groups lauded the order. Members of the industry, one of the oldest in the country, have long made the case that heavy regulations \u2014 many intended to protect the health of fish populations \u2014 leave the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage to the fleets of countries that don't bear the same kind of burden. That disadvantage is a big piece of why America imports more than two-thirds of its seafood, they argue.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s executive order recognizes the challenges our fishing families and communities face, and we appreciate the commitment to reduce burdensome regulations and strengthen the competitiveness of American seafood,\u201d said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association.",
      "Some fishermen, including Maine lobsterman Don McHenan, said they're looking forward to members of the industry being able to fish in areas of the ocean that have been closed off to them for years. McHenan said he's also hopeful the pace of new regulations will slow.",
      "\u201cAs long as they don't put any more onto us,\u201d McHenan said. \u201cWe'll see \u2014 time will tell.\u201d",
      "But the support for deregulation is not unanimous among fishermen. Some say strong conservation laws are critical to protecting species that fishermen rely on to make a living.",
      "In Alaska, for example, Matt Wiebe said the executive order \u201cterrifies\u201d him. A commercial fisherman with more than 50 years of experience fishing for salmon, he said the order could potentially harm the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery, which has received praise from sustainability organizations for careful management of the fish supply.",
      "Absent that management, he said the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery could go the way of the New England cod fishing business, which collapsed due in large part to overfishing and has never recovered.",
      "\u201cSince New England fishers lost their cod fishery due to overfishing, many other fisheries came to respect and depend on conservation efforts,\u201d Wiebe said. \u201cWe fish because it's what we do, and conservation efforts mean we and our kids can fish into the future.\u201d",
      "The executive order arrived at a time when America's commercial fishermen are coping with environmental challenges and the decline of some once-marketable species. Maine's historic shrimp fishery shuttered more than a decade ago, California's salmon industry is struggling through closures and the number of fish stocks on the federal overfished list has grown in recent years.",
      "There is also the looming question of what Trump's trade war with major seafood producers such as Canada and China will mean for the U.S. industry \u2014 not to mention American consumers.",
      "To many in Maine's lobster and fishing business, the answer is clear: Cut regulations and let them do their thing.",
      "\u201cWe definitely feel the industry is over-regulated as a whole,\" said Dustin Delano, a fourth-generation Maine lobsterman who is also chief operating officer of the New England Fishermen\u2019s Stewardship Association. \u201cWe hope that this will help for sure. It does seek to initiate that America-first strategy in the fishery.\u201d",

      "Some of the punitive tariffs, including Beijing's retaliatory 125% tariffs on U.S. exports, could be rolled back, but a full reversal is unlikely, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "\u201cThis means China\u2019s exports to the U.S. are set for further declines over the coming months, not all of which will be offset by increased trade with other countries. We still expect export growth to turn negative later this year,\u201d Huang said.",
      "China\u2019s politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States was nearly $20.5 billion in April, down from about $27.2 billion a year earlier. In the first four months of the year, China's exports to the United States fell 2.5% from a year earlier, while imports from the U.S. fell 4.7%.",

Shipments to India jumped nearly 16% by value, and exports to Africa surged 15%.",

      "The Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office closed on Wednesday the Center for Asbestos Related Disease in Libby, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the U.S.-Canada border. The town of about 3,000 people is near a mine that produced asbestos dust for decades, and the clinic has been at the forefront of efforts to help victims.",
      "Courts in Montana have said BNSF contributed to the pollution when it brought contaminated material from the mine through town, and the railway separately faces numerous lawsuits from asbestos victims in Libby and surrounding communities.",
      "But the Texas-based railway prevailed in a 2023 lawsuit alleging the clinic fraudulently made some patients eligible for government benefits when it knew they were not sick. The railway challenged the validity of over 2,000 diagnoses by the clinic and 337 were ruled false.",
      "The railway brought the lawsuit on behalf of the federal government, which provides specialized Medicare services to Libby\u2019s asbestos victims. BNSF was entitled to a share of the $6 million judgment against the clinic, and after adding in attorney fees, court costs and interest, the railway says it\u2019s now owed $3.1 million.",
      "\u201cThe judge determined the amount of damages to be repaid, and the process for recovery is set by law,\" BNSF spokesperson Kendall Kirkham Sloan said in a statement.",
      "Clinic Executive Director Tracy McNew said the closure would have a broad impact on public health in the Libby area as fewer people are screened for asbestos-related health problems.",
      "\u201cCARD remains committed to its patients and the Libby community and will fight to reopen as soon as possible,\u201d McNew said in a statement.",
      "The clinic for more than 20 years has provided health screenings, monitoring and treatment of patients with problems caused by asbestos exposure. It declared bankruptcy after the judgment in the fraud case was handed down. It kept operating and didn\u2019t pay the money under a settlement reached in bankruptcy court with the federal government that included BNSF.",
      "CARD bankruptcy attorney James \u201cAndy\u201d Patten said the railway's attempts to collect on the fraud judgment violated the bankruptcy settlement, which was approved by a federal court.",
      "Sloan declined to comment on the bankruptcy settlement.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014",
      "Long-threatened tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have plunged the country into trade wars abroad \u2014 all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.",
      "Trump is no stranger to tariffs. He launched a trade war during his first term, taking particular aim at China by putting taxes on most of its goods. Beijing responded with its own retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. products. Meanwhile, Trump also used the threat of more tariffs to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate a North American trade pact, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in 2020.",
      "When President Joe Biden took office, he preserved most of the tariffs Trump previously enacted against China, in addition to imposing some new restrictions. But his administration claimed to take a more targeted approach.",
      "Fast-forward to today, and economists stress there could be greater consequences on businesses and economies worldwide under Trump's more sweeping tariffs this time around \u2014 and that higher prices will likely leave consumers footing the bill. There's also been a sense of whiplash from Trump's back-and-forth tariff threats and responding retaliation seen over the last few months.",
      "Here's a timeline of how we got here:",
      "Trump is sworn into office. In his inaugural address, he again promises to \u201ctariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\" And he reiterates plans to create an agency called the External Revenue Service, which has yet to be established.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump also says he expects to put 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting on Feb. 1, while declining to immediately flesh out plans for taxing Chinese imports.",
      "Trump threatens 25% tariffs on all Colombia imports and other retaliatory measures after President Gustavo Petro\u2019s rejects two U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants to the country, accusing Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation.",
      "In response, Petro also announces a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods. But Colombia later reversed its decision and accepted the flights carrying migrants. The two countries soon signaled a halt in the trade dispute.",
      "Trump signs an executive order to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 4. Trump invoked this power by declaring a national emergency \u2014 ostensibly over undocumented immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "The action prompts swift outrage from all three countries, with promises of retaliatory measures.",
      "Trump agrees to a 30-day pause on his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada, as both trading partners take steps to appease Trump's concerns about border security and drug trafficking.",
      "Trump's new 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports to the U.S. still go into effect. China retaliates the same day by announcing a flurry of countermeasures, including new duties on a variety of American goods and an anti-monopoly investigation into Google.",
      "China's 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas products, and a 10% levy on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S., take effect Feb. 10.",
      "Trump announces plans to hike steel and aluminum tariffs starting March 12. He removes the exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel, meaning that all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, and also raises his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%.",
      "Trump announces a plan for \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 promising to increase U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that countries worldwide charge on imports \u201cfor purposes of fairness.\u201d Economists warn that the reciprocal tariffs, set to overturn decades of trade policy, could create chaos for global businesses.",
      "Trump signs an executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether a tariff on imported copper is needed to protect national security. He cites the material's use in U.S. defense, infrastructure and emerging technologies.",
      "Trump signs an additional executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether tariffs on lumber and timber are also needed to protect national security, arguing that the construction industry and military depend on a strong supply of wooden products in the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico go into effect, though he limits the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. He also doubles the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20%.",
      "All three countries promise retaliatory measures. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. And Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her country would respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods without specifying the targeted products immediately, signaling hopes to de-escalate.",
      "China, meanwhile, imposes tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of key U.S. farm exports, set to take effect March 10. It also expands the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.",
      "Trump grants a one-month exemption on his new tariffs impacting goods from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The pause arrives after the president spoke with leaders of the \u201cBig 3\u201d automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.",
      "In a wider extension, Trump postpones 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month.",
      "Trump credited Sheinbaum with making progress on border security and drug smuggling as a reason for again pausing tariffs. His actions also thaw relations with Canada somewhat, although outrage and uncertainty remains. Still, after its initial retaliatory tariffs of $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) on U.S. goods, the government says it's suspended a second wave of retaliatory tariffs worth $125 billion Canadian (US$87 billion).",
      "China's retaliatory 15% tariffs on key American farm products \u2014 including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef \u2014 take effect. Goods already in transit are set to be exempt through April 12, per China\u2019s Commerce Ministry previous announcement.",
      "Trump's new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports go into effect. Both metals are now taxed at 25% across the board \u2014 with Trump\u2019s order to remove steel exemptions and raise aluminum\u2019s levy from his previously-imposed 2018 import taxes.",
      "The European Union takes retaliatory trade action promising new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products. The measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will be hit, as they were during Trump\u2019s first term. The 27-member bloc later says it will delay this retaliatory action until mid-April.",
      "Canada, meanwhile, announces plans to impose more retaliatory tariffs worth Canadian $29.8 billion ($20.7 billion) on U.S. imports, set to go into effect March 13.",
      "Trump threatens a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with its previously-announced plans for a 50% tariff on American whiskey.",
      "Trump says he will place a 25% tariff on all imports from any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela, in addition to imposing new tariffs on the South American country itself, starting April 2.",
      "The tariffs would most likely add to the taxes facing China, which in 2023 bought 68% of the oil exported by Venezuela, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a number of countries also receive oil from Venezuela \u2014 including the United States itself.",
      "Trump says he is placing 25% tariffs on auto imports. These auto imports will start being collected April 3 \u2014 beginning with taxes on fully-imported cars. The tariffs are set to then expand to applicable auto parts in the following weeks, through May 3.",
      "Trump announces his long-promised \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 declaring a 10% baseline tax on imports across the board starting April 5, as well as higher rates for dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the U.S. to take effect April 9.",
      "Among those steeper levies, Trump says the U.S. will now charge a 34% tax on imports from China, a 20% tax on imports from the European Union, 25% on South Korea, 24% on Japan and 32% on Taiwan. The new tariffs come on top of previously-imposed levies, including the 20% tax Trump announced on all Chinese imports earlier this year.",
      "Meanwhile, for Canada and Mexico, the White House says USMCA-compliant imports can continue to enter the U.S. duty-free. Once the two countries have satisfied Trump\u2019s demands on immigration and drug trafficking, the White House adds, the tariff on the rest of their imports may drop from 25% to 12%.",
      "Trump's previously-announced auto tariffs begin. Prime Minister Mark Carney says that Canada will match the 25% levies with a tariff on vehicles imported from the U.S.",
      "China announces plans to impose a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10, matching Trump's new \"reciprocal\u201d tariff on Chinese goods, as part of a flurry of retaliatory measures.",
      "The Commerce Ministry in Beijing says it will also impose more export controls on rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products like computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. And the government adds 27 firms to lists of companies subject to trade sanctions or export controls.",
      "Trump's 10% minimum tariff on nearly all countries and territories takes effect.",
      "Trump's higher \u201creciprocal\u201d rates go into effect, hiking taxes on imports from dozens of countries just after midnight. But hours later, his administration says it will suspend most of these higher rates for 90 days, while maintaining the recently-imposed 10% levy on nearly all global imports.",
      "China is the exception. After following through on a threat to raise levies against China to a total of 104%, Trump says he will now raise those import taxes to 125% \u201ceffective immediately\u201d \u2014 escalating tit-for-tat duties that have piled up between the two countries. The White House later clarifies that total tariffs against China are actually now 145%, once his previous 20% fentanyl tariffs are accounted for.",
      "China upped its retaliation prior to this announcement \u2014 vowing to tax American goods at 84% starting April 10. Also earlier, EU member states vote to approve their own retaliatory levies on 20.9 billion euros ($23 billion) of U.S. goods in response to Trump\u2019s previously-imposed steel and aluminum tariffs. The EU\u2019s executive commission doesn\u2019t immediately specify which imports it will tax, but notes its counter tariffs will come in stages \u2014 with some set to arrive on April 15, and others May 15 and Dec. 1.",
      "Separately, Canada's counter tariffs on auto imports take effect. The country implements a 25% levy on auto imports from the U.S. that do not comply with the 2020 USMCA pact.",
      "The EU puts its steel and aluminum tariff retaliation on hold for 90 days, to match Trump's pause on steeper \u201creciprocal\u201d levies. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the commission wants to give negotiations with the U.S. a chance \u2014 but warns countermeasures will kick in if talks \u201care not satisfactory.\u201d",
      "China says it will raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, in response to Trump's heightened levies. The new rate is set to begin April 12.",
      "Later, the Trump administration unveils that electronics, including smartphones and laptops, will be exempt from so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs. But in the days following, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signals that this is only a temporary reprieve, saying that sector-specific levies on semiconductors will arrive in \u201cprobably a month or two.\u201d And other, non-\"reciprocal\" tariffs that tax some electronics, notably from China, remain.",
      "Trump says he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains.",
      "The Trump administration also launches investigations into imports of computer chips, chipmaking equipment and pharmaceuticals \u2014 signaling next steps toward imposing tariffs on these sectors. The U.S. Commerce Department posts notices about these probes, seeking public comment within the next three weeks.",
      "Separately, the Commerce Department says it's withdrawing from a 2019 agreement that had suspended an antidumping investigation into fresh tomato imports from Mexico. That termination, set to take effect July 14, means most tomatoes from Mexico will be subject to a 20.91% tariff.",
      "Trump signs executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts \u2014 aimed at easing import taxes for vehicles that are made with foreign parts, but assembled in the U.S.",
      "For one year, the administration says it will provide a rebate of 3.75% relative to the sales prices of a domestically-assembled car \u2014 a figure reached by putting the previously-imposed 25% import tax on parts that make up 15% of that price. And for the second year, the rebate would equal 2.5% of the sales price, applying to a smaller share of the vehicle\u2019s parts.",
      "The latest round of Trump's auto tariffs takes effect. The previously-announced 25% levies now apply to a range of imported auto parts.",
      "Trump threatens a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, while claiming that the movie industry in the U.S. is dying. It isn't immediately clear how such a tariff on international productions could be implemented, but Trump says he's authorized the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to \u201cimmediately begin the process.\u201d",
      "The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses tried to get ahead of Trump\u2019stariffs. Federal data showed an enormous stockpiling of pharmaceutical products. The deficit \u2014 which measures the gap between the value of goods and services the U.S. sells abroad against what it buys \u2014 has roughly doubled during the past year.",
      "Also, the U.S. government announced that top officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation over the weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since President Trump sparked a trade war. No country has been hit harder by Trump\u2019s trade war than China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter and second largest economy. U.S. tariffs against China are set at 145% and China tariffs on the U.S. at 125%.",
      "The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged at 4.3%, saying that the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen due to uncertainty about how and when Trump\u2019s tariffs might impact the U.S. economy. Chair Jerome Powell underscored that the tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment and that there\u2019s currently too many unknowns to be able to predict how the Fed might adjust its monetary policy going forward.",
      "The United States and Britain announced a trade deal, potentially lowering the financial burden from tariffs while creating greater access abroad for American goods. The president said the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the U.K., which would also streamline the processing of U.S. goods though customs. Trump said final details were being written up. \u201cIn the coming weeks, we\u2019ll have it all very conclusive,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Britain said the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10%, with a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff. It also eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Separately, the European Union published a list of U.S. imports that it would target with retaliatory duties if no solution is found to end U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war. The EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, also said it would begin legal action at the World Trade Organization over the \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d that Trump imposed on countries around the world a month ago.",

      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, eased. The average rate dropped to 5.89% from 5.92% last week. It\u2019s down from 6.38% a year ago, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasurys, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions and bond market investors\u2019 expectations about the economy and inflation.",
      "After climbing to a just above 7% in mid-January, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained above 6.62%, where it was just four weeks ago. It then spiked above 6.8% in the following two weeks and eased last week to 6.76%.",

    "story": [
      "The construction of a road is drawing attention in the run-up to the annual U.N. climate conference in Brazil",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- In the run-up to the annual U.N. climate conference, set to take place in Brazil\u2019s Amazon in November, the construction of a road is drawing attention, with critics arguing it will lead to environmental degradation.",
      "Before the talks, called COP30, the state government of Para is building a 13-kilometer (8-mile) avenue designed to ease traffic on a major highway that runs parallel.",
      "The road was planned long before Belem, a metropolitan area of 2.5 million people that sits on the edge of the Amazon, was chosen as conference host. That hasn't spared it sharp criticism, however, because the road is expected to cut across the last remnants of rainforest in Belem.",
      "Road building in the Amazon, which historically has often led to deforestation and development of surrounding areas, also stands in stark contrast to a central aim of climate conferences, and in particular this one: conservation of biodiversity.",
      "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has made the slowing of deforestation a central focus of his administration, has frequently boasted that this will be the first such conference in the Amazon rainforest.",
      "The Amazon is key to regulating the climate, because trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that heats the planet when released into the atmosphere.",
      "\u201cWe will hold the best COP in history because the topic of all the ones held in other countries was the Amazon,\" Lula said while visiting Belem worksites in February. \u201cThis one will be in the Amazon.\u201d",
      "An official project map shows a straight line dividing a green area through the city\u2019s outskirts. This protected area is slightly larger than Manhattan. It was designated in 1993 to protect two lakes, a river basin and to restore a degraded rainforest. However, its rules allow private properties, government-approved deforestation and public works. Two university campuses are located within its limits.",
      "\u201cEven with measures to reduce the damage, there are tough issues to address,\u201d said Roberta Rodrigues, a professor of architecture at the Federal University of Para. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a road being built along the banks of the Guama River without it leading to illegal development. It may lead to the end of this protected area.\"",
      "The project dates back to 2020. Construction began in mid-2024, despite criticism over its impact on one of the city\u2019s few remaining green areas. The project drew wider attention in March, when the BBC reported that the avenue was \"being built for COP30.\u201d As the story was picked up by news outlets around the world, Brazil\u2019s government issued a statement saying the avenue wasn't among the 33 infrastructure projects planned for COP30.",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, the state government of Para said that the avenue, named Liberdade, or Freedom, will be an expressway and development around it won't be permitted.",
      "The chaotic growth of Brazilian cities, however, suggests it's a promise that will be hard to keep. Countless public areas have been occupied for the irregular construction of housing \u2014 from modest structures to luxury condos \u2014 with the expectation that they will eventually be legalized, which often ends up happening.",
      "Belem is the capital of Para, which is run by Gov. Helder Barbalho, a politician from a traditional family who is an ally of Lula. Both support oil drilling in the nearby mouth of the Amazon River, likely a point of contention during COP30.",
      "The road is scheduled to be inaugurated just before the conference kicking off on Nov. 10.",

      "India and Pakistan have fought three full-scale wars since they gained independence from Britain in 1947",
      "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) \u2014 India and Pakistan have fought three full-scale wars since they gained independence from Britain in 1947. They\u2019ve also had dozens of skirmishes and conflicts, including one atop a glacier dubbed the coldest and highest-altitude battlefield in the world.",
      "The latest escalation follows a deadly gun attack on tourists that India blames Pakistan for \u2014 Islamabad denies any connection. But they don\u2019t fight wars like other countries.",
      "The dominant factor is their nuclear weapons arsenal, a distinct way of deterring major attacks and a guarantee that fighting doesn\u2019t get out of hand, even when the situation is spiraling.",
      "Here\u2019s how \u2014 and why \u2014 India and Pakistan fight the way they do:",
      "\u201cPakistan and India have enough nuclear weapons to wipe the other side out several times over,\u201d says security analyst Syed Mohammed Ali, who is based in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. \u201cTheir nuclear weapons create a scenario for mutually assured destruction.\u201d",
      "Both countries have \u201cdeliberately developed\u201d the size and range of their stockpile to remind the other about the guarantee of mutually assured destruction, he adds.",
      "Neither country discloses their nuclear capabilities but each is thought to have between 170 and 180 warheads that are short-, long- and medium-range. Both countries have different delivery systems \u2014 ways of launching and propelling these weapons to their targets.",
      "The arsenals are a defensive move to prevent and deter further fighting, because \u201cneither side can afford to initiate such a war or hope to achieve anything from it,\u201d Ali says.",
      "It might not look this way to the outsider, but nuclear weapons are a reminder to the other side that they can't take things too far.",
      "But the secrecy around their arsenals means that it's unclear if Pakistan or India can survive a first nuclear strike and retaliate, something called \u201csecond-strike capability.\u201d",
      "This capacity stops an opponent from attempting to win a nuclear war through a first strike by preventing aggression that could lead to nuclear escalation.",
      "Without this capability, there is, in theory, nothing to stop one side from launching a warhead at the other.",
      "India and Pakistan have each laid claim to Kashmir since 1947, when both gained independence, and border skirmishes have created instability in the region for decades. Each country controls a part of Kashmir, which is divided by a heavily militarized border.",
      "The two archrivals have also fought two of their three wars over Kashmir \u2014 a disputed Himalayan region divided between the them where armed insurgents resist Indian rule. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.",
      "Border flare-ups and militant attacks in India-controlled Kashmir have prompted New Delhi to take an increasingly tough position on Islamabad, accusing it of \u201cterrorism.\u201d",
      "In the latest conflict, India punished Pakistan by hitting what it said were sites used by Pakistan-backed militants linked to a gun massacre last month.",
      "India is one of the biggest defense spenders in the world, with $74.4 billion in 2025, according to the Military Balance report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. It\u2019s also one of the world\u2019s largest arms importers.",
      "Pakistan is no slouch, spending $10 billion last year, but it can never match India\u2019s deep pockets. India also has more than double the number of active armed forces personnel than Pakistan does.",
      "While India\u2019s armed forces are traditionally focused on Pakistan, it has another nuclear neighbor to contend with, China, and it is increasingly concerned with maritime security in the Indian Ocean. Those are two factors that Pakistan doesn\u2019t have to consider in its security paradigm.",
      "Pakistan's long and narrow shape, together with the outsized role of the military in foreign policy, makes it easier to move the armed forces around and prioritize defense.",
      "Neither Pakistan or India are in a hurry to announce their military moves against the other and, as seen in the current flare-up of hostilities, it can take a while for confirmation of strikes and retaliation to surface.",
      "But both launch operations into territories and airspace controlled by the other. Sometimes these are intended to damage checkpoints, installations, or sites allegedly used by militants.",
      "They are also aimed at embarrassing or provoking \u2014 forcing leaders to bow to public pressure and respond, with the potential for miscalculation.",
      "Many of these activities originate along the Line of Control, which divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. It's largely inaccessible to the media and public, making it hard to independently verify claims of an attack or retaliation.",
      "Such incidents raise international alarm, because both countries have nuclear capabilities, forcing attention back to India and Pakistan and, eventually, their competing claims over Kashmir.",
      "The fear of nuclear war has put the two countries at the top of the agenda, competing with the papal conclave, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s policies, and the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs trial in the news cycle.",
      "Pakistan and India\u2019s battles and skirmishes are away from the public eye.",
      "Strikes and retaliation are late at night or early in the morning and, with the exception of the drone attacks on Thursday, they mostly take place away from densely populated urban centers. It shows that neither country has the desire to significantly harm the other\u2019s population. Attacks are either described as surgical or limited.",
      "Neither country is motivated by competition for resources. Pakistan has huge mineral wealth, but India isn't interested in these and, while there are stark ideological differences between Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan, they don\u2019t seek control or influence over the other.",
      "Other than Kashmir, they have no interest in claiming the other\u2019s territory or exercising dominance.",

      "The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week despite heightened uncertainty about how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact the U.S. economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week despite heightened uncertainty about how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact the U.S. and global economies.",
      "Jobless claim applications fell by 13,000 to 228,000 for the week ending May 3, the Labor Department said Thursday. That\u2019s in line with the 229,000 new applications analysts forecast.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have mostly bounced around a healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 decimated the economy and wiped out millions of jobs.",
      "Even though Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats, concerns remain about a global economic slowdown that could upend the U.S. labor market, which has been a pillar of the American economy for years.",
      "On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate at 4.3% for the third straight meeting, after cutting it three times in a row at the end of last year.",
      "Fed chair Jerome Powell said the risks of both higher unemployment and inflation have risen, an unusual combination that complicates the central bank\u2019s dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low.",
      "Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment but that data has not yet shown significant harm to the economy.",
      "A contraction has already begun in the U.S., where the economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March as Trump\u2019s trade wars disrupted business. First-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the United States tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s massive tariffs went into effect.",
      "It was the first quarterly GDP decline in three years.",
      "Like his pledge to institute tariffs, Trump\u2019s promise to drastically downsize the federal government workforce has occupied much of the early weeks of his presidency and is still in motion.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when the job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 or \u201cDOGE,\u201d spearheaded by Elon Musk \u2014 will surface in the weekly layoffs data. However, the federal government staff reductions are already being felt, even outside of the Washington, D.C. area.",
      "Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains robust with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.",
      "Last week the government reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April. The unemployment rate held at a historically healthy 4.2%, however, many economists anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers.",
      "Companies that have announced job cuts this year include Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta.",
      "The Labor Department reported that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week gyrations, inched up by 1,000 to 227,000.",
      "The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of April 26 fell to 1.88 million, a decrease of 29,000.",

      "Melinda French Gates says she and her ex-husband, Bill Gates, always intended for the foundation they started together to spend down all of its resources rather than to exist in perpetuity",
      "Melinda French Gates entered some of the most powerful circles while leading the foundation she co-founded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates.",
      "She petitioned heads of state and convened other billionaires. Along with Gates, she won the trust of one of America's most admired investors, Warren Buffett, who has given more than $43 billion to the former couple's foundation.",
      "French Gates, who studied computer science and worked at Microsoft, the company Gates created, exited the Gates Foundation last year to pursue philanthropy and investment through her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, which she started in 2015. The foundation changed its name from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after her departure.",
      "At an ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, which also launched her new memoir, French Gates said she left, in part, to respond to the U.S. rollback of women\u2019s rights.",
      "\u201cI thought, I want to be much more nimble than this, and I want to be able to set the agenda by myself without having to ask anybody else, and do it with my partners,\u201d she said.",
      "French Gates offered written responses to The Associated Press' questions about the foundation\u2019s 25th anniversary and its decision to close in 2045. She said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources.",
      "\u201cUltimately, though,\" she wrote, \u201cthe timeline was Bill\u2019s decision to make with the board of trustees.\u201d",
      "The following responses have been edited for length.",
      "A: To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed. We talked a lot there about unlocking virtuous cycles. I like to think that right now, the foundation\u2019s work is contributing to a child getting a vaccine or a woman opening her first bank account \u2014 and that decades from now, their families and communities are going to continue to look different, because of what that child and that woman unlocked for the people around them.",
      "A: I was excited for us to launch the Giving Pledge because I believe that the most responsible thing to do with great wealth is give it away \u2014 and that you have an obligation to society to give it away as effectively as possible. I think it\u2019s important for people in that position to set norms around giving generously and to learn as much as possible from each other about how to be effective in their philanthropy.",
      "(As for gender), for too long, global health and development efforts treated women and girls as secondary \u2014 if they were considered at all. Data wasn\u2019t collected on their experiences. Their specific health needs were often ignored.",
      "There were so many questions that needed to be asked: What is the cost of all the unpaid labor women do at home? Will mobile banking make a difference if women don\u2019t have equal access to cellphones? Why are so many infectious diseases especially dangerous for women?",
      "We opened a gender equality division, but not just that \u2014 we made gender equality a priority across all of our work. And we put a lot of resources into expanding access to contraception, starting with a big commitment we made in 2012.",
      "A: When you\u2019re doing this kind of work, it doesn\u2019t take long to see that solutions that seem great on paper may not work in reality. We funded community toilets in India that people \u2014 especially women \u2014wouldn\u2019t use because they were dangerous to go to at night. We funded vaccines in Vietnam that had to be kept cold, but came in packaging that didn\u2019t fit into the small refrigerators most people had there. We funded a simple pump to help East African farmers irrigate their land, but women \u2014 who account for half of all smallholder farmers \u2014 wouldn\u2019t buy it, because they didn\u2019t want to be seen swaying their hips in the way the pump required.",
      "There are many ways to learn about the cultural norms and logistical issues that determine whether a solution is feasible \u2014 and they all boil down to engaging people with local knowledge and lived experience, and trusting what they tell you.",
      "A: It\u2019s easy for people to forget \u2014 or maybe they didn\u2019t ever know \u2014 how hopeless the situation seemed around the year 2000, when malaria, tuberculosis and HIV were totally out of control. Since then, efforts funded, in large part, by development aid have saved more than 65 million lives from those diseases alone.",
      "No doubt the work has just gotten a lot harder, but we never thought it was going to be easy. And we still have the key ingredients of success. The pipeline of innovations has never been stronger. More lower-income countries are taking a leading role. As some donors announce cuts, others are stepping up.",

      "INDIAN WELLS, Ca. -- Bill Gates is pledging 99% of his remaining fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will spend it all within 20 years. The funds will be delivered over time and will allow the foundation to spend another $200 billion by the time it closes in 2045.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a little bit more that goes to the kids and some portion that, you know, I won\u2019t be wanting for anything for my consumption,\u201d Gates said. Even his climate-related investments, \u201call of the profits that come from that work go into the Gates Foundation.\u201d",
      "In interviews with The Associated Press, Gates spoke about the foundation\u2019s past work and future goals. His responses have been edited for length.",
      "\u201cI hope other people wallop me. Even today, there\u2019s probably a dozen people richer than I am, because I don\u2019t count the money that I\u2019ve already got in the foundation. I have just a bit over $100 billion outside of the foundation. I\u2019d love to be beat in all of this work. Somebody should try and pay more taxes than I did, and save more lives than I did, and give more money than I did, and be smarter than I\u2019ve been.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone. It will be spent. Hopefully, many of these diseases are eradicated, so nobody even knows, \u2018What was malaria? What was polio?\u2019 in the years ahead. You know, some foundations, if they\u2019ve been around 50 or 60 years, who knows how their work relates to the intent of the person who started that foundation? And I do think there\u2019ll be more rich people in the future than there are today. So yes, it will create a vacuum in 20 years, and we\u2019re letting people know way in advance that\u2019s what this will look like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s by some measures the most generous gift ever given and a real vote of confidence from Warren, who\u2019s a great friend and has always given me phenomenal advice and is very driven by these inequity issues. And that was in 2006, and so it\u2019s two years later that I give up my full-time work at Microsoft, and I move over. And I\u2019ve been full time at the foundation since 2008 for the rest of my life. It\u2019s my final, second career. You know, Warren, it\u2019s hard to overstate the impact he\u2019s had on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was a big hope, that the societal expectation for anybody who has a lot of money would be that they give the majority of it away, and that basically everyone would join into that. Now, we\u2019re not at that level, but I think year by year, people are saying, \u2018Hey, the fairness of this system, the legitimacy of this system really benefits if those who both through skill and luck, the system has rewarded them, that they put a lot of their resources and even, some of their time and energy into improving society.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cMany things now are making it less clear how much progress we\u2019ll make in these 20 years we have remaining. The donors are being somewhat less generous as they feel squeezed by an aging population and demands for Ukraine, both refugee costs, defense costs, a lot of things. And so telling the story of the success and the moral and geopolitical value of taking 1% of rich country budgets and saying, \u2018No, this is to save lives for very, very, very little money.\u2019 We\u2019re going to have to renew people\u2019s understanding and prioritization of these things in order to keep that piece. We have a lot of things we\u2019re optimistic about because we have new tools, new ways of protecting women from getting HIV, new ways of killing mosquitoes... And so it\u2019s incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we can\u2019t get them out to everyone who needs them. So, it\u2019s going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need.\u201d",
      "\u201cMelinda has made a phenomenal contribution to the foundation, helping us pick the right people and being in partnerships, traveling the world, bringing her perspective to things. I can\u2019t say enough good things about how she got us off on the right track. When we divorced, we hoped \u2014 I hoped \u2014 that she would choose to stay. She stayed for a period of time, continued to do great work, and then chose to do the philanthropy on her own.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur work is for saving children\u2019s lives. So it\u2019s true, if they have other priorities, it\u2019s hard to influence my commitment to not having mothers bleed to death or kids not dying from malaria. To be honest, the number of civil society actors that are in here trying to influence the work we do is so tiny. It\u2019s unbelievable. I mean, I could almost list their names on one piece of paper. Where are these people? We want more people second-guessing our work, criticizing our work. I mean, what\u2019s their idea about malnutrition? What\u2019s their idea on how to deal with these funding cuts? What do they want us to do?\u201d",

      "In its first 25 years, the Gates Foundation became one of the world\u2019s largest charitable foundations and one of the most powerful institutions in global health",
      "SEATTLE -- In its first 25 years, the Gates Foundation became one of the world\u2019s largest charitable foundations and one of the most powerful institutions in global health \u2014 an accomplishment that carried both accolades and controversy.",
      "Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates had grand ambitions for their foundation, but little experience in global health or philanthropy. They were moved by stories like those written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof about children dying from diseases caused by a lack of sanitation. In characteristic Gates style, they tackled these problems with rigor, data and close oversight.",
      "As a result, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 formed in 2000 by the merger of two family foundations and funded by Gates\u2019 Microsoft wealth and later, by tens of billions from investor Warren Buffett \u2014 inserted itself into the architecture of global health.",
      "Along the way, the foundation\u2019s leaders redefined what it means to be philanthropists.",
      "\u201cAs I was learning about what children die of, you know, HIV and diarrhea and pneumonia, were all things that I was stunned how little was going into helping the poor countries,\u201d Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He responded in a way few others could, by pouring billions into the foundation, which spent $100 billion in its first 25 years, with about half going toward global health.",
      "Thanks to its largesse, as well as the expertise of its employees, its connections to governments and companies, and the profile of its founders, the Gates Foundation now garners at least the same influence, if not more, in almost any global health forum as many countries.",
      "That era now has an end date. Gates announced Thursday that the foundation will close in 2045, pledging that he plans to donate 99% of his remaining fortune, which would be $107 billion today, to the nonprofit by then. Gates said the foundation can maintain its culture and workforce over that time.",
      "\"We\u2019ll be showing that we\u2019re doing the most we can and give a lot of predictability to the field by (saying,) \u2018We\u2019ll be here all of those 20 years, but not thereafter,\u2019\" he said.",
      "The foundation's influence over global health policy and its partnerships with companies and other private sector actors have long drawn questions.",
      "Researcher Linsey McGoey, a professor of sociology at the University of Essex, who wrote the book \u201cNo Such Thing as a Free Gift \u201d about the foundation, asks how charitable it is to \u201cgive away\u201d money to a foundation the donor controls.",
      "Others like Anuj Kapilashrami, global health professor at the University of Essex, argue the foundation's preference for low-cost treatments and interventions does not inherently help build the capacity of health systems.",
      "\u201cWe do not tackle the causes, the underlying drivers of what is producing ill-health, but we choose areas and health issues where we can just push these magic bullets: commodities, drugs (and) bed nets,\u201d she said.",
      "Mark Suzman, who has been with the foundation for 18 years and CEO since 2020, said close supervision of grantees and the foundation\u2019s data-driven processes are key to its success.",
      "\u201cWe are not a 'write the check, call us in three years and let us know what it looks like,\u2019\u201d kind of funder, Suzman said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be calling you up probably every week, and we\u2019ll have some opinions. But we want your opinions back.\u201d",
      "The foundation is proud of the many vaccines, medical devices and treatment protocols it has helped develop. It is optimistic about a pipeline of innovations, including potential vaccines for malaria and HIV, as possible accomplishments in its remaining 20 years.",
      "David McCoy, a physician who was then at the University College London, argued back in 2009 that only a small portion of the foundation\u2019s spending went directly to organizations located in the countries where they work, with most going to international organizations like the World Health Organization or to groups located in the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Suzman said he has been an internal champion of shifting more of the foundation's work from Seattle to in-country offices.",
      "The foundation\u2019s flagship issue, and the main way it measures its success, is in reducing preventable childhood deaths.",
      "The Gates Foundation helped establish two major public-private partnerships: Gavi, the vaccine alliance that funds and distributes vaccines for children, and the Global Fund, which, along with governments, funds the treatment and control of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.",

      "\u201cThat is not to discount the millions of lives saved, or children immunized, or women who have access to reproductive health, or the innovations that have brought efficiency,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut if you think about the social contract between states taking care of their people, how do we have that same kind of accountability in this type of a system?\u201d",

      "Gates hopes others will surpass his giving.",

      "Bill Gates says he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation",
      "SEATTLE -- SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Bill Gates says he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned. Today, that would be worth an estimated $107 billion.",
      "The pledge is among the largest philanthropic gifts ever \u2013 outpacing the historic contributions of industrialists like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie when adjusted for inflation. Only Berkshire Hathaway investor Warren Buffett's pledge to donate his fortune \u2014 currently estimated by Forbes at $160 billion \u2014 may be larger depending on stock market fluctuations.",
      "Gates' donation will be delivered over time and allow the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years. The foundation already has an endowment of $77 billion built from donations from Gates, Melinda French Gates and Buffett.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of thrilling to have that much to be able to put into these causes,\u201d Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "His announcement Thursday signals both a promise of sustained support to those causes, particularly global health and education in the U.S., and an eventual end to the foundation\u2019s immense worldwide influence. Gates says spending down his fortune will help save and improve many lives now, which will have positive ripple effects well beyond the foundation's closure. It also makes it more likely that his intentions are honored.",
      "\u201cI think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone,\u201d Gates said.",
      "In a league of its own",
      "The pledge is \u201ca welcome bit of boldness,\u201d at a time when optimism is in short supply said, Rhodri Davies, a philanthropy expert and author of the publication, \u201cPublic Good by Private Means.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis announcement seems like yet more evidence that norms in foundation philanthropy might be shifting\u201d away from a default of operating in perpetuity, he said.",
      "The Gates Foundation has long been peerless among foundations \u2014 attracting supporters and detractors but also numerous unfounded conspiracy theories.",
      "In addition to the $100 billion it has spent since its founding 25 years ago, it has directed scientific research, helped develop new technologies, and nurtured long-term partnerships with countries and companies.",
      "About 41% of the foundation\u2019s money so far has come from Warren Buffett and the rest from the fortune Gates made at Microsoft.",
      "Started by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates in 2000, the foundation plays a significant role in shaping global health policy and has carved out a special niche by partnering with companies to drive down the cost of medical treatments so low- and middle-income countries could afford them.",
      "\u201cThe foundation work has been way more impactful than I expected,\u201d Gates said, calling it his second and final career.",
      "The foundation\u2019s influence on global health \u2014 from the World Health Organization to research agendas \u2014 is both a measure of its success and a magnet for criticism. For years, researchers have asked why a wealthy family should have so much sway over how the world improves people\u2019s health and responds to crises.",
      "Gates said, like any private citizen, he can choose how to spend the money he earns and has decided to do everything he can to reduce childhood deaths.",
      "\u201cIs that a bad thing? It\u2019s not an important cause? People can criticize it,\u201d he said, but the foundation will stick to its global health work.",
      "The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and statehouses from Melinda French Gates\u2019 organization, Pivotal Ventures.",
      "Major ambitions for the remaining 20 years",
      "The foundation\u2019s most prized metric is the drop in childhood deaths from preventable causes by almost half between 2000 and 2020, according to United Nations figures. The foundation\u2019s CEO Mark Suzman is careful to say they do not take credit for this accomplishment. But he believes they had a \u201ccatalytic role\u201d \u2014 for example, in helping deliver vaccines to children through Gavi, the vaccine alliance they helped create.",
      "The foundation still has numerous goals \u2014 eradicating polio, controlling other deadly diseases, like malaria, and reducing malnutrition, which makes children more vulnerable to other illnesses.",
      "Gates hopes that by spending to address these issues now, wealthy donors will be free to tackle other problems later.",
      "The Gates Foundation had planned to wind down two decades after Gates' death, meaning today\u2019s announcement significantly moves up that timetable. Gates plans to stay engaged, though at 69, he acknowledged he may not have a say.",
      "In its remaining two decades, the foundation will maintain a budget of around $9 billion a year, which represents a leveling off from its almost annual growth since 2006, when Buffett first started donating.",
      "Suzman expects the foundation will narrow its focus to top priorities.",
      "\u201cHaving that time horizon and the resources just puts an even greater burden on us to say, \u2018Are you actually putting your resources, your thumb down, on what are going to be the biggest, most successful bets rather than scattering it too thinly?\u2019\" Suzman said, which he acknowledged was creating uncertainty even within the foundation about what programs would continue.",
      "Gates is the only remaining founder",
      "Major changes preceded the foundation's 25th year.",
      "In 2021, Melinda French Gates and Bill Gates divorced, and Buffett resigned as the foundation\u2019s trustee. They recruited a new board of trustees to help govern the foundation, and in 2024, French Gates left to continue work at her own organization.",
      "French Gates said she decided to step down partly to focus on countering the rollback of women\u2019s rights in the U.S. At the ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, she said she wanted to leave the foundation at a high point.",
      "\u201cI so trusted Mark Suzman, the current CEO,\" she said. \u201cWe had a board in place that I helped put in place, and I knew their values.\u201d",
      "Even as the foundation\u2019s governance stabilizes, the road ahead looks difficult. Enduring conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, global economic turmoil and cuts to foreign aid forecast fewer resources coming to global health and development.",
      "\u201cThe greatest uncertainty for us is the generosity that will go into global health,\u201d Gates said. \u201cWill it continue to go down like it has the last few years or can we get it back to where it should be?\u201d",
      "Even facing these obstacles, Gates and the foundation speak, as they often do, with optimism, pointing to innovations they\u2019ve funded or ways they\u2019ve helped reduce the cost of care.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we can\u2019t get them out to everyone who needs them,\u201d Gates said. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, \u2018Just stay in it, man,'\" said Adelman, who's the son of Hall of Fame coach Rick Adelman. \u201cThey\u2019re coming in at 100 miles per hour, they have a great basketball team, well-coached. It just feels good to come out with a win.\u201d",
      "As for homecourt advantage, David Adelman believes the 3-pointer has become the great equalizer for a road team.",
      "\u201cI also think that\u2019s why you see more blowouts in the playoffs, because there are teams that can get hot and make 20, 22 3s,\u201d Adelman explained. \u201cIt can get out of control very quickly.\u201d",
      "Even more, Adelman reasoned that today's players are almost insulated from the loud noise in opposing arenas.",
      "\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the way they grew up, playing AAU and traveling all over the place and playing,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cThey\u2019re less likely to feel as much anxiety on the road.\u201d",
      "Thunder coach Mark Daigneault has a more simplistic approach when it comes to road games \u2014 or any games for that matter.",
      "\u201cIf we can stay focused,\" Daigneault said, \"in a great environment on what we need to do, we have confidence we can win the game.\u201d",

      "What to Know: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nikola Jokic, the frontrunners in the NBA MVP race, went a combined 15 of 47 from the floor in Game 3, including 1 of 16 from 3-point range. It would be a big surprise to see that kind of shooting display \u2014 Jokic was 8 of 25, Gilgeous-Alexander finished 7 of 22 \u2014 out of them again. The Thunder did a masterful job of rolling coverage toward Jokic, the reigning MVP. He had 16 rebounds to go with 20 points and six assists. He's yet to record a triple-double in the series after posting three in seven games against the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round. Gilgeous-Alexander was 1 of 8 in the fourth quarter and didn't take a shot in overtime. \u201cA few of the shots felt good, more than a few,\u201d said Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 18 points and 13 rebounds in nearly 45 minutes. \u201cThey didn\u2019t go in, obviously.\u201d",

      "What to Know: Cleveland played its best \u2014 and most complete \u2014 game of the series to avoid falling into the dreaded 3-0 deficit. But questions remain. All-Star guard Darius Garland was not himself after returning from a toe injury that forced him to miss the Cavs previous four games and Atkinson isn\u2019t sure if, or how much, he\u2019ll play Sunday night. Atkinson was also waiting to see how NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley and key backup De\u2019Andre Hunter felt after also returning from injuries. The Pacers are looking for a much better start and a much better effort than the one coach Rick Carlisle criticized Friday night. They also must figure out a way to slow down Mitchell, who has scored 33, 48 and 43 points in the first three games. On top of that, they must find a way to ignite All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton again. He had little significant presence Friday as he finished with four points and five assists.",

      "It\u2019s hard to ignore the heaviest player in NFL history.",
      "Watson\u2019s journey to make the Tampa Bay Buccaneers began this weekend at the team\u2019s rookie camp. He already has dropped between 25-30 pounds since weighing 464 pounds at the league\u2019s scouting combine and he plans to lose more.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good story, but I don\u2019t want that to be my narrative,\u201d Watson said Saturday. \u201cI want to be known as a football player and a good football player at that. But I guess it\u2019s nice to make history.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-6 defensive tackle from Florida is working with a team nutritionist and they haven\u2019t determined an ideal playing weight for him yet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress,\u201d Watson said Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to go. We\u2019re going to see where I play best, where I feel best at.\u201d",
      "Watson went undrafted last month before his hometown team signed him as a free agent. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling when he met with reporters before his second day of practice.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy. It\u2019s a dream come true. I can\u2019t do anything but smile,\u201d Watson said. \u201cMy life feels like a movie. You couldn\u2019t write a script where a person goes from little league to high school to college (to the NFL) not having to go out of state.\u201d",
      "Watson, who grew up about 20 miles from Raymond James Stadium, said he\u2019s still never seen snow. He\u2019s excited to learn from another big man, 346-pound defensive tackle Vita Vea. Watson briefly met the two-time Pro Bowler and exchanged a handshake.",

      "\u201cHe looked just as impressive before as he does now, so he\u2019s a huge man. He\u2019s got a lot of size,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cHe has to make the team, first of all. Right now, we just have to see how long he can stay on the field and (we) put him on a program where we think he can make some progress. I think that\u2019s the biggest thing for us to do, right now. We didn\u2019t get him to say, \u2018Hey, we have to put you on the field right now.\u2019 It\u2019s, \u2018Hey, we can try to put you on this program and see what we can come up with and see if we can get our endurance better,\u2019 and have him become a better player that way, then kind of see where he is. To judge him right now is very early and we didn\u2019t get him for the tush push, we got him because we really thought he could play. It\u2019s just a matter of getting him to the point where he can play more than two or three plays a (drive).\u201d",
      "Watson\u2019s size and affable personality have made him a fan favorite. He has plenty of supporters rooting for him to make the team and make an impact.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve felt the love,\u201d Watson said. \u201cMainly because it\u2019s unheard of, I feel like people gravitate toward me. It\u2019s been that way my whole life as far as just the energy I carry around. I do appreciate it.\u201d",
      "Watson wowed NFL scouts last month by repping 225 pounds a whopping 36 times, which topped any bench-press performance at this year\u2019s combine. He covered the 40-yard dash in 5.93 seconds and recorded 25 inches in the vertical jump.",
      "Watson finished his collegiate career with 63 tackles and 1 1/2 sacks. He also reluctantly carried the ball for a 1-yard gain and lined up at fullback for a few more plays against Tulane in the Gasparilla Bowl in December.",
      "\u201cIt was special,\u201d Watson said of his carry. \u201cA lot of my supporters were trying to get me and the coaching staff to do it. I was always against it, but I felt like to finish off my college career, I had to give people what they wanted to see.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt feels good,\u201d Giovanni Williams said Saturday after practice. \"It feels, I'd say, honestly, bittersweet just because living behind them, making my own name, I had to still live behind them. But it\u2019s sweet because me and my brother (Quincy) play the same position. So it\u2019s like, I can call on him for help and we've got the same competition level. So it's going to be like competition, just like always.",

      "If the younger Williams can make the team, it's believed the Jets would be the first squad in NFL history to have three brothers on the same active roster.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it will mean a lot to me just to know that I came to the minicamp and I was coachable, I had urgency,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd just to be on the team with my brothers, it\u2019ll feel good. It\u2019ll be historical.\u201d",
      "He still has plenty of work to do to pave that path to potential football history. But getting on the field with the rest of the Jets' rookies was a good start.",
      "\u201cI just think it\u2019s outstanding that he has a Jets jersey on and both of his brothers are actually here with us, so it\u2019s a beautiful story,\u201d coach Aaron Glenn said. \u201cHe\u2019s working his butt off.\u201d",
      "Quinnen was a first-round draft pick of the Jets \u2014 No. 3 overall \u2014 out of Alabama in 2019. He has since been selected once as an All-Pro and three times for the Pro Bowl.",

      "Giovanni, meanwhile, spent three years at Texas A&M Kingsville and played the 2021 and 2022 seasons after sitting out as a freshman during the 2020 COVID-19 year. He transferred to Miles and played in two games in 2023 and had 29 total tackles and a sack in 11 games last season \u2014 after breaking his right hand in the season opener \u2014 while helping the school win a conference championship.",
      "\u201cI'm in the middle \u2014 I've got Quincy's speed, but I've got Quinnen's build,\u201d said Giovanni, who said he weighs 222 pounds and was listed as 6-foot-1 in college. \u201cSo it\u2019s like I\u2019m the middle of both of them. So everybody compares me as the hybrid of both.\u201d",
      "It wasn't always that way, though. In fact, Giovanni said, he weighed more \u2014 a lot more \u2014 than the 303-pound Quinnen when he was younger.",

      "He has videos and photos posted on his Instagram page, showing how he dramatically transformed his body.",
      "\u201cYeah, actually, there\u2019s a funny story about that,\u201d Giovanni said. \"So I went from 350 (pounds) to like 185 in like three or four months and then I had to build it all the way up to like 220 just to get solid because when I was like 350, that was like, all right, you know, you've got to look the part. So I didn\u2019t look like I was a middle linebacker.",
      "\u201cSo I kind of was, like, I got in my head a little bit. I won\u2019t say depressed, but I just got in my head a little bit and I was like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to work now, you've got to look the part.' So I just did everything I could do and just got all my weight down and then just built it back up solid.\u201d",
      "And now he's on an NFL field after getting a call from his agent saying that the Jets were going to give him an opportunity to join his brothers.",
      "\u201cHonestly, seeing my chances, all I can do is just come out here and do me and just handle my business,\u201d he said. \u201cPut my best foot forward and see whatever happens, happens.\u201d",

But he is 0-3 on the road this postseason, with a .758 save percentage and a 7.24 goals-against-average while not finishing any of the three games at St. Louis in the first round.",

      "The Celtics should probably be no worse than tied. They had 20-point leads in the second half of both games in Boston, but both ended with Mikal Bridges making a steal to preserve a Knicks victory.",
      "There hasn't been the same drama in the West series. Minnesota raced to a 13-0 lead and never trailed in its 117-93 victory Thursday, after Golden State led comfortably most of the way in Game 1 even after Curry was lost to a hamstring injury.",
      "\u201cI think both teams are really committed to defense,\" Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. \"We for sure have to take all of the easy baskets out of the game. I think we\u2019ll try to figure out a few other things that they\u2019re doing, as you do in a series as it goes along. Of course, defense is going to be huge.\u201d",
      "The Celtics' problem has been their offense. They are 25 for 100 from 3-point range in the series and have averaged just 16.5 points in the fourth quarter. All-Star Jayson Tatum has missed 30 of his 42 shot attempts.",
      "\u201cI take full ownership on the way that I\u2019ve played in this series and can\u2019t sugarcoat anything,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cI need to be better and I expect to be a lot better.\u201d",

      "Series: Knicks lead, 2-0",
      "BetMGM says: Celtics by 5.5",
      "What to Know: The Knicks blew a 2-0 lead in this same round last year, when the Indiana Pacers came back to beat them in seven games. That is the most recent of the 28 times an NBA team has come back from a 2-0 deficit to win a seven-game series. Five of those came after the team lost the first two games at home, with the Celtics pulling off one of those comebacks in 2017 against Chicago. Boston went 33-8 on the road in the regular season.",

      "Series: Tied, 1-1.",
      "BetMGM Sportsbook: Timberwolves by 5.5.",
      "What to Know: Draymond Green\u2019s temper is something to watch as the series shifts to San Francisco\u2019s Chase Center for the next two games, given the Golden State forward was hit with his fifth technical foul of these playoffs and is two shy of an automatic suspension. Minnesota missed its initial 16 3-point attempts in Game 1 and finished 5 of 29, but the Wolves bounced back to shoot 50.6% overall and 16 for 37 on 3s in Game 2. Warriors coach Steve Kerr\u2019s rotation went 14 deep as he tried various combinations to see who could fill the void with Curry out. Forward Jonathan Kuminga, whose role had diminished down the stretch and didn\u2019t play against Memphis in the play-in game or the regular-season finale, made his first eight shots and scored 18 points on 8-for-11 shooting in 26 minutes. He will surely be needed again along with Trayce Jackson-Davis after he made all six of his field goals and had 15 points and six rebounds.",

      "The 6-foot-2, 267-pound former Boise State defensive end, who was the first Egyptian drafted into the NFL last month by Detroit, created a new memory Friday by taking snaps at the Lions rookie minicamp.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just so grateful, so honored to be here,\u201d Hassanein said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like doesn\u2019t feel real. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t want to leave the field. I love it. The coaching, my teammates, just the competitiveness, it\u2019s been great. And I\u2019m just looking forward to tomorrow and just take it day by day.\u201d",
      "Hassanein, who was selected in the sixth round with the 196th pick, said one of the biggest moments he's had since arriving at minicamp was meeting coach Dan Campbell. When he was drafted, an exuberant Hassanein proclaimed, \u201c I would die for that guy. I would run through a wall for him like I ran through a wall for Coach D (Boise State coach Spencer Danielson).\u201d",
      "As he came out to the practice field, the two finally met and shook hands.",
      "\u201cIt kind of feels unreal,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s an awesome guy. I\u2019m just looking forward to learn from him off the field and on the field.\u201d",
      "It is hoped that Hassanein will help fill the edge rusher hole that the Lions have opposite Aidan Hutchinson.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll say about Ahmed is he\u2019s relentless,\u201d Lions assistant general manager Ray Agnew said Friday. \u201cHe plays the game the way we like to play. He plays it hard. He\u2019s a second-effort rusher. He can win with hands as a rusher. ... And I think when (defensive line ) coach (Kacy) Rodgers get his hands on him to coach him up, the kid\u2019s going to be a good player for us. So we\u2019re excited about him.\u201d",
      "To live up to the Lions' hopes, Hassanein knows he has a lot of work ahead of him and is ready for the challenge.",
      "\u201cI look for hardships,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to get better at stuff. I want to because I don\u2019t want to take the easy way out. I want to earn everything. I don\u2019t want nothing to be given to me.\"",
      "Hassanein, who moved to California in 2018 from Cairo, Egypt, said he has been surprised by the outpouring of attention that he's been receiving from Egyptians.",
      "\u201cMan, it\u2019s being the first Egyptian you\u2019re talking about culture and teams,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople look out to me. I get texts all the time that people just want to be like me, inspired to be like me. I\u2019m just so grateful and so honored that Jesus pulled me in this position. I mean, I\u2019m gonna give it all I got.\u201d",

      "GENEVA -- England will send a record six teams into the Champions League next season, further fueling the wealthy Premier League\u2019s financial power over the rest of Europe.",
      "Manchester United and Tottenham advanced Thursday to an all-English final of the second-tier Europa League, with the winner of that match earning a place in the next Champions League where the prize money is typically four times greater.",
      "Man United and Tottenham\u2019s good results in Europe \u2014 while struggling badly in the Premier League \u2014 also contributed to English clubs\u2019 collectively strong season. Chelsea also advanced Thursday to the final of the third-tier Conference League and will play Real Betis.",
      "\u201cThe weight of money in the Premier League means that even malfunctioning teams such as Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham have budgets that are multiples of those of the clubs with which they are competing,\u201d said Kieran Maguire, a soccer finance expert from The Price of Football podcast.",
      "Premier League teams had weeks ago sealed one of the two bonus Champions League entries which UEFA now awards to the best performing countries each year.",
      "England dominated the knockout phase in European seasons before in 2021, 2019 and 2008, though Spain in 2016 was perhaps best of all.",
      "England\u2019s surge is ideal timing. UEFA's prize money pot for the three competitions grew by 25% to more than 3.3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) this season thanks to new commercial deals for the expanded 36-team format.",
      "Advancing to the Champions League knockout phase should now earn an English club at least 100 million euros ($112 million) from UEFA. The title winner can get 160 million euros ($180 million), compared to Real Madrid\u2019s 139 million euros ($156 million) last season.",
      "The highest Europa League earner last year, Bayer Leverkusen, got 41 million euros ($46 million) and that also should rise for Man United and Tottenham.",
      "It adds up to more money going to England this season, more big-earning chances next season \u2014 with nine teams overall in Europe, compared to just seven from Germany and Italy \u2014 and a virtuous financial circle in the Premier League already awash with money from global broadcast deals.",
      "English soccer\u2019s financial juggernaut helped push Real Madrid plus financially ailing Barcelona and Juventus to launch the ultimately failed European Super League four years ago.",
      "Since 2018, four guaranteed Champions League spots go to the four countries ranked highest by UEFA based on collective results by their clubs across five European seasons. They have been England, Spain, Italy and Germany since 2008.",
      "The Champions League growing this season to 36 teams from 32 let UEFA, in agreement with the European Club Association, award an extra entry to each of the two countries whose teams do best in the previous season.",
      "This season, England has a huge 28.892 ranking points total, or \"coefficient\" in UEFA jargon. That\u2019s five points, or 17%, more than Spain.",
      "The Europa League winner has had direct entry to the next Champions League since 2015. It is a last-chance option for Man United and Tottenham who are down in 15th and 16th places, respectively, in the Premier League.",
      "Spain was the first country to have five Champions League teams, in 2015-16. Now England has set a new level.",
      "Former Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger suggested this week that Man United and Tottenham did not deserve being lifted up into the Champions League.",
      "\u201cThey should qualify automatically for the Europa League again, not necessarily for the Champions League,\u201d Wenger said on BeIN Sports. \u201cEspecially when you are in a league where you have already five teams that qualify.\u201d",
      "Money helps explain, University of Liverpool academic Maguire suggested, why there is an all-English final on May 21 in Bilbao, Spain.",
      "Man United and Tottenham are top-10 clubs in Europe for overall revenue \u2014 at $867 million and $693 million, according to UEFA research \u2014 and can retain deep squads of players.",
      "\u201cThis means they can rotate players around the Sunday-Thursday-Sunday demands in terms of playing intensity and travel that opponents struggle to match,\u201d Maguire said.",
      "Their beaten semifinal opponents, Athletic Bilbao and Bodo/Glimt of Norway, had combined income last year less than one-third of Tottenham alone.",
      "UEFA prize money flowing to English clubs often feeds less-wealthy Premier League rivals, who can outbid most of Europe to pay transfer fees and wages.",
      "Talent-rich teams like Bournemouth, Brighton and Crystal Palace can expect more offers for their best players this offseason, and use their money and smart scouting to re-stock squads.",
      "\u201cClubs seventh to 10th in the Premier League are far more wealthy than the equivalent elsewhere in Europe which helps explain why they have made more progress,\u201d Maguire said.",

      "Chicago Sky star Angel Reese is ready to start winning in the WNBA after setting records as a rookie",
      "CHICAGO -- Angel Reese's rookie year surpassed nearly all expectations.",
      "The Chicago Sky All-Star set records before her season got cut short by an injury and helped the league soar to new heights in popularity after she and the Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark took their rivalry from the college ranks to the pros.",
      "One thing Reese didn't do was win. Not the way she is accustomed to winning. That's something she wants to change, starting with a marquee opener at Indiana on May 17.",
      "\u201cI wasn't used to that,\" Reese said. \"It just takes an adjustment. It's something that you don't want to get used to because you don't want to get in a mindset, like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re just going to be losing every night.' We were right there every night.\u201d",
      "The Sky finished 10th in the WNBA with a 13-27 record last season and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2018. The disappointing results were despite getting significant contributions from Reese and fellow rookie Kamilla Cardoso. The two young stars are back, and the team made major roster changes to give them some help.",
      "Chicago fired former coach Teresa Weatherspoon after one year and hired Las Vegas assistant Tyler Marsh to replace the Naismith Hall of Famer.",
      "The Sky also brought in veteran leadership, including franchise career assist leader Courtney Vandersloot and acquiring two-time All-Star Ariel Atkins from Washington. Chicago hopes the additions will help Reese and Cardoso take their games to another level.",
      "\u201cShe wants to compete, she wants to win, she\u2019s somebody that puts that above everything else,\" general manager Jeff Pagliocca said of Reese. \"With all the time that she puts into building her brand and flying all over the world, she still has proven to us time and time again she puts basketball first.",
      "\"Only a competitive player is going to have all these things in her life that are so special but still want to be the greatest player she can be.\u201d",
      "Reese and Clark helped change the landscape of the WNBA, drawing sellout crowds and record ratings while spurring debates about the sport and society. The rivals from LSU and Iowa showcased a style and swagger that captivated the nation when they were going at it in college.",
      "Reese, who finished second to Clark in the Rookie of the Year voting, averaged 13.6 points and a league-record 13.1 rebounds. She set a WNBA record with double-doubles in 15 straight games and finished with 26 on the season \u2014 the most ever by a rookie.",
      "Reese briefly held the mark for total rebounds with 446, only to miss the final six games with a wrist injury. While she was out, league MVP A\u2019ja Wilson finished with 451.",
      "But while the records piled up, so did the losses.",
      "In two seasons at Maryland and two more at LSU, Reese's teams lost a total of 20 games and never dropped more than two in a row. She won an NCAA championship with the Tigers in 2023, beating Clark and Iowa in the final.",
      "The Sky, meanwhile, lost 12 of their final 14 games last season. They dropped seven in a row before beating the Los Angeles Sparks on Sept. 6, only to have Reese suffer a hairline fracture in her left wrist that required surgery. With their star sidelined, they won their next game and lost the final five.",
      "\u201cObviously, that left a bad taste in my mouth,\u201d she said.",
      "Reese had a busy offseason, playing in the Unrivaled 3-on-3 league and trying to increase her range and develop into the sort of stretch power forward the Sky envision her becoming. She shot 39% last season and made just 3 of 16 3-pointers.",
      "\u201cWe want her to be dynamic,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWe want her to be able to score inside. We want to be able to create space for her to have more one-on-one finishes inside and to not have to have to feel like she's got to play in a crowd. We want to put the ball in her hands on the perimeter and allow her to facilitate and create off the dribble as well.\u201d",
      "Reese said the issue was more her hesitancy to take the shots than her ability to hit shots from the perimeter.",
      "\u201cI always just tell myself if I work out and make the shots I might as well take them in the game,\u201d she said.",
      "Reese got a taste of the championship atmosphere when she sat courtside during the WNBA finals between New York and Minnesota. She showed up for Game 5 wearing what looked like a custom outfit split down the middle with a Liberty jersey on her left side and Lynx jersey on the right.",
      "Reese also excelled in Unrivaled. Her team Rose BC won the championship, though she missed the playoffs after hurting her surgically repaired wrist. She likes the makeup of the Sky and believes Chicago will be difficult to beat.",
      "\u201cI think we have the right pieces this year,\u201d Reese said. \u201cWe have the great veteran leadership. We have coaches that just built a culture from the beginning and built the standards, so I\u2019m excited.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhile cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the Nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country,\u201d the BCCI statement said.",

      "Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles enhanced by unsuspected ally: artificial intelligence",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles designed with an assist from artificial intelligence.",
      "The app that helped make gamers out of anyone with a smartphone uses AI to help developers create levels to serve a captive audience constantly looking for more sweets to squash. King, the Swedish video game developer behind Candy Crush, also uses AI to update older levels to help ensure players don't feel bored, stuck or frustrated as they spend time with the game.",
      "Todd Green, general manager of the Candy Crush franchise, said using AI in that way helps free up developers' time to create new puzzle boards. It would be \"extremely difficult,\" he said, for designers to update and reconfigure more than 18,000 levels without AI taking a first pass.",
      "Within the video game industry, discussions around the use of AI in game development run the gamut. Some game makers see AI as a tool that can assist with menial tasks, allowing designers and artists to focus on bigger projects. AI, they say, can help build richer worlds by creating more interactive non-player characters, for example. But there are also those who strongly oppose the use of AI, or who see the tech as a threat to their livelihoods \u2014 be it as video game actors and performers, or as workers who help make games. Concerns over AI led game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists to go on strike in late July.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not putting chatbots into the game. We\u2019re not putting AI-powered design experiences into the game for players directly to play with,\u201d Green said, adding that the tech is not being used to replace game workers. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re trying to deploy AI on existing problems that we have in order to make the work of the teams faster or more accurate, and more accurate more quickly.\u201d",
      "In the United States, consumer spending on video game content increased to $51.3 billion in 2024, up from $49.8 billion in 2023, with mobile games accounting for about half of all video game content spending, according to data from the Entertainment Software Association trade group. Mobile is now the leading game platform among players aged 8 and older, the ESA says.",
      "Candy Crush \u2014 first launched on Facebook in 2012 \u2014 is constantly updating. King recently released its 300th client version of the game. Gaming giant Activision Blizzard acquired King in 2016 for $5.9 billion.",
      "The free-to-play game is in a unique position, said Joost Van Dreunen, author of \u201cOne Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.\u201d Candy Crush is more than a decade old, boasts millions of users and caters to a \u201cravenous set of players,\" he said. Demand is so high for new content that it makes sense to use AI to offset the work it takes to create so many levels, Van Dreunen added.",
      "\u201cTo supply that at scale, you absolutely can rely on a sort of artificial intelligence or generative AI to create the next set of forms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing about Candy Crush is that every level is technically a single board that you have to solve or clear before you can advance. With AI and the existing library of human-made boards, it makes total sense to then accelerate and expand the efforts to just create more inventory. People play more levels.\u201d",
      "King uses AI to target two separate areas: developing new levels and going back to older levels, in some cases, puzzles that are several years old, and reworking them to ensure they're still worth playing. On new levels designed for people who have played the game for a long time, the company wants to ensure the puzzles are fun \u201con first contact.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s hard for us to do, because we don\u2019t get the benefit of having many players test or play through the levels and give us feedback. We have to sort of try and pitch it right at first,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really important group for us in between people who maybe played before and perhaps took a break for a while, and then coming back because they saw or heard of or were curious about what might be new.\u201d",
      "Green said King uses AI as a behind-the-scenes assistant in the design \u201cloop\u201d of the game, rather than as a tool that immediately puts something new in front of players.",
      "\u201cDoing that for 1,000 levels all at once is very difficult by hand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the most important thing to understand here is that we are using AI as like a custom design.\u201d",
      "For most players, Green said, the fun in solving the puzzles lies in the \u201cup and down.\u201d Levels aren't designed in order of difficulty. An easy level can follow a few difficult levels \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 to give the game a sense of variety. Leveraging AI means that instead of the team working on several hundred levels each week, they could potentially improve thousands of levels per week because they're able to automate the drafting of the improved levels, he added.",
      "\u201cWe talk to players all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also get the quantitative feedback. We can see how players respond to the levels... How easy are the levels? Do they get sort of stuck, or are they progressing in the way that we hope?\u201d",
      "To determine whether gamers and playing through the way the designers intended, King looks at several factors, including pass rate \u2014 how many times a player passes a level out of every 100 attempts \u2014 and how often a board is \u201creshuffled,\u201d or refreshed with all candies rearranged. Some metrics are also intangible, like whether a level is simply fun.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also, to some extent, obviously subjective,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s different for different people.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Many autism experts say the Trump administration's plan to find autism's causes is unrealistic",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many experts, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s promise for \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d to find autism's causes in a few months is jarring \u2014 and unrealistic.",
      "That\u2019s because it appears to ignore decades of science linking about 200 genes that play a role \u2014 and the quest to understand differences inside the brain that can be present at birth.",
      "\u201cVirtually all the evidence in the field suggests whatever the causes of autism \u2014 and there\u2019s going to be multiple causes, it\u2019s not going to be a single cause \u2014 they all affect how the fetal brain develops,\u201d said longtime autism researcher David Amaral of the UC Davis MIND Institute.",
      "\u201cEven though we may not see the behaviors associated with autism until a child is 2 or 3 years old, the biological changes have already taken place,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy on Wednesday announced the National Institutes of Health would create a new database \u201cto uncover the root causes of autism and other chronic diseases\u201d by merging Medicaid and Medicare insurance claims with electronic medical records and other data. He has cited rising autism rates as evidence of an epidemic of a \u201cpreventable disease\u201d caused by some sort of environmental exposure and has promised \u201csome of the answers by September.\u201d",
      "Autism isn\u2019t considered a disease. It's a complex brain disorder better known as autism spectrum disorder, to reflect that it affects different people in different ways.",
      "Symptoms vary widely. For some people, profound autism means being nonverbal and having significant intellectual disabilities. Others have far milder effects, such as difficulty with social and emotional skills.",
      "Autism rates are rising \u2014 not among profound cases but milder ones, said autism expert Helen Tager-Flusberg of Boston University.",
      "That's because doctors gradually learned that milder symptoms were part of autism\u2019s spectrum, leading to changes in the late 1990s and early 2000s in diagnosis guidelines and qualifications for educational services, she said.",
      "The link between genes and autism dates back to studies of twins decades ago. Some are rare genetic variants passed from parent to child, even if the parent shows no signs of autism.",
      "But that's not the only kind. As the brain develops, rapidly dividing cells make mistakes that can lead to mutations in only one type of cell or one part of the brain, Amaral explained.",
      "Noninvasive testing can spot differences in brain activity patterns in babies who won't be diagnosed with autism until far later, when symptoms become apparent, he said.",
      "Those kinds of changes stem from alterations in brain structure or its neural circuitry \u2014 and understanding them requires studying brain tissue that\u2019s available only after death, said Amaral, who\u2019s the scientific director of a brain banking collaborative called Autism BrainNet. The bank, funded by the nonprofit Simons Foundation, has collected more than 400 donated brains, about half from people with autism and the rest for comparison.",
      "Researchers have identified other factors that can interact with genetic vulnerability to increase the risk of autism. They include the age of a child\u2019s father, whether the mother had certain health problems during pregnancy including diabetes, use of certain medications during pregnancy, and preterm birth.",
      "Any concern that measles vaccinations could be linked to autism has been long debunked, stressed Tager-Flusberg, who leads a new Coalition of Autism Scientists pushing back on administration misstatements about the condition.",
      "The U.S., with its fragmented health care system, will never have the kind of detailed medical tracking available in countries like Denmark and Norway \u2014 places with national health systems where research shows similar rises in autism diagnoses and no environmental smoking gun.",
      "Experts say Kennedy's planned database isn't appropriate to uncover autism's causes in part because there's no information about genetics.",
      "But researchers have long used insurance claims and similar data to study other important questions, such as access to autism services. And the NIH described the upcoming database as useful for studies focusing on access to care, treatment effectiveness and other trends.",

      "Google will pay $1.4 billion to Texas to settle claims the company collected users' data without permission, the state\u2019s attorney general announced Friday.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton described the settlement as sending a message to tech companies that he will not allow them to make money off of \u201cselling away our rights and freedoms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn Texas, Big Tech is not above the law.\" Paxton said in a statement. \u201cFor years, Google secretly tracked people\u2019s movements, private searches, and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won.\u201d",
      "The agreement settles several claims Texas made against the search giant in 2022 related to geolocation, incognito searches and biometric data. The state argued Google was \u201cunlawfully tracking and collecting users\u2019 private data.\u201d",
      "Paxton claimed, for example, that Google collected millions of biometric identifiers, including voiceprints and records of face geometry, through such products and services as Google Photos and Google Assistant.",

      "The company also clarified that the settlement does not require any new product changes.",
      "Paxton said the $1.4 billion is the largest amount won by any state in a settlement with Google over this type of data-privacy violations.",
      "Texas previously reached two other key settlements with Google within the last two years, including one in December 2023 in which the company agreed to pay $700 million and make several other concessions to settle allegations that it had been stifling competition against its Android app store.",
      "Meta has also agreed to a $1.4 billion settlement with Texas in a privacy lawsuit over allegations that the tech giant used users' biometric data without their permission.",

      "AI can be very persuasive, Harris said, and scholars are studying the intersection of the technology and manipulation tactics.",
      "Cynthia Godsoe, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and a former public defender, said as this technology continues to push the boundaries of traditional legal practices, courts will have to confront questions they have never before had to weigh: Does this AI photograph really match the witness's testimony? Does this video exaggerate the suspect's height, weight, or skin color?",
      "\u201cIt's definitely a disturbing trend,\" she said, \u201cbecause it could veer even more into fake evidence that maybe people don't figure out is false.\u201d",

      "When bounding through the jungle, chimps will often grab hold of the tall buttress roots of rainforest trees. Sometimes they pound them several times to create low-frequency sounds that can be heard for a kilometer or more through the forest.",
      "Scientists believe that the drumming is a form of long-distance communication, perhaps to alert other chimps where one chimp is waiting or the direction it is traveling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way of socially checking in,\u201d said Hobaiter, adding that each chimp has its own \u201cindividual signature \u2014 a pattern of beats that allows you to recognize who\u2019s producing that drumming.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and executives from Microsoft and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices testified on Capitol Hill about the biggest opportunities, risks and needs facing an industry which lawmakers and technologists agree could fundamentally transform global business, culture and geopolitics.",
      "The hearing comes as the race to control the future of artificial intelligence is heating up between companies and countries. Altman's OpenAI is in a furious race to develop the best artificial intelligence model against tech rivals like Alphabet and Meta, as well as against those developed by Chinese competitors.",
      "\u201cI believe this will be at least as big as the internet, maybe bigger,\u201d Altman said in his opening remarks about AI\u2019s potential to transform society. \u201cFor that to happen, investment in infrastructure is critical.\u201d Altman urged senators to help usher in the \u201cdual revolutions\u201d of artificial intelligence and energy production that \u201cwill change the world we live in, I think, in incredibly positive ways.\u201d",
      "The witnesses included Altman; Lisa Su, chief executive of semiconductor maker AMD; Michael Intrator, co-founder of AI cloud computing startup CoreWeave; and Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft. They four executives unanimously urged lawmakers to help streamline policy for AI-related projects and fundraising.",
      "The hearing spanned topics ranging from industry debates over chip performance, jobs, human relationships and power generation to grander questions about the global competition with China and the European Union.",
      "\u201cChina aims to lead the world in AI by 2030,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. \u201cIn this race, the United States is facing a fork in the road. Do we go down the path that embraces our history of entrepreneurial freedom and technological innovation? Or do we adopt the command and control policies of Europe?\u201d",
      "Senators were broadly sober in their questioning and united in their concern that the U.S. maintain its dominance in artificial intelligence. Lawmakers from both parties also raised concerns over cybersecurity, data privacy and AI's ability to create content that could confuse or mislead people.",
      "Some partisan fighting did arise. Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, pressed Su and Smith on whether the Biden administration\u2019s sustainable energy policies hindered the goal of producing more power for AI-related infrastructure.",
      "And Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, criticized cuts by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to federal funding for research and to agencies like the Energy Department\u2019s national laboratories and National Science Foundation, painting them as \u201ca self sabotaging attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoes anyone truly have confidence that had DOGE been around decades ago, they would not have cut the project that created the internet as an example of wasteful, publicly funded research and development?\u201d asked Duckworth.",
      "But despite some barbs, the hearing maintained a low-key tenor and some bipartisan joking as lawmakers and executives discussed the potential of a technology all present agreed would determine humanity's future.",
      "\u201cLook, there is a race, but we need to understand what we\u2019re racing for,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, told the witnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a sort of commercial race, so we can edge out our nearest competitor in the public sector or the private sector. We\u2019re trying to win a race so that American values prevail.\u201d",
      "Several of the executives warned against U.S. export controls that could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe totally understand as an industry the importance of national security,\u201d Su said. But she added, if not able to \u201chave our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play.\u201d Those technologies are less advanced today but will mature over time, she said.",
      "Altman drew a direct connection between the United State's ability to attract global talent and ability to sell its products globally to national security and its international influence.",
      "\u201cThe leverage and the power the U.S. gets from having iPhones be the mobile device people most want, and Google being the search engine that people most want around the world is huge,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe talk maybe less about how much people want to use chips and other infrastructure developed here, but I think it\u2019s no less important, and we should aim to have the entire U.S. stack be adopted by as much of the world as possible.\u201d",
      "Trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the AI industry, including California-based chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.",
      "The Trump administration announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China.",
      "Nvidia has said the tighter export controls will cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. AMD said after reporting its quarterly earnings this week that it will cost the firm $1.5 billion in lost revenue over the coming months.",
      "Still uncertain are the effects on additional AI chip controls set by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that are set to take effect next week targeting more than 100 countries. The policy drew strong opposition from Nvidia and other tech companies, while it was supported by others, including AI company Anthropic, as a way to prevent China\u2019s \u201csophisticated smuggling operations\u201d to obtain chips from shell companies in third countries.",
      "The Commerce Department said in an email Thursday that Trump plans to replace Biden\u2019s \u201coverly complex, overly bureaucratic\u201d rule with a simpler one but didn\u2019t say when.",
      "The day before the hearing, Altman visited the Abilene, Texas, site of the massive Stargate data center project being built for OpenAI in collaboration with Oracle and other partners. The site was chosen for its potential access to a variety of energy resources, including wind and solar power.",
      "Altman, during the hearing, said that Texas had been \u201cunbelievable\" in incentivizing major AI projects. \u201cI think that would be a good thing for other states to study,\u201d Altman said. He predicted that the Abilene site would be the \u201clargest AI training facility in the world.\u201d",
      "But Altman also later cautioned against a patchwork regulatory framework for AI.",
      "\u201cIt is very difficult to imagine us figuring out how to comply with 50 different sets of regulations,\u201d said Altman. \u201cOne federal framework that is light touch, that we can understand, and it lets us move with the speed that this moment calls for, seems important and fine.\u201d",
      "While the tech industry has long relied on data centers to run online services, from email and social media to financial transactions, new AI technology behind popular chatbots and generative AI tools requires even more powerful computation to build and operate.",
      "A report released by the Department of Energy late last year estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028 when it could consume up to 12% of the nation\u2019s electricity.",

      "New experiments show eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side, according to experiments with over 200 eggs.",
      "What does this mean for the best way to crack an egg for breakfast? Not much, since a break around the middle is the best way to get the golden yolk and runny whites to ooze out.",
      "But scientists said it could help with hard-boiling eggs in a pot: Dropping eggs in horizontally may be less likely to cause a stray crack that can unleash the egg's insides in a puffy, cloudy mess.",
      "It's commonly thought that eggs are strongest at their ends \u2014 after all, it's how they're packaged in the carton. The thinking is that the arc-shaped bottom of an egg redirects the force and softens the blow of impact.",
      "But when scientists squeezed eggs in both directions during a compression test, they cracked under the same amount of force.",
      "\u201cThe fun started when we thought we would get one result and then we saw another,\u201d said Hudson Borja da Rocha with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped run the experiments.",
      "The researchers also ran simulations and dropped eggs horizontally and vertically from three short heights up to 0.4 inches (10 millimeters).",
      "The egg result? The ones dropped horizontally cracked less .",
      "\u201cThe common sense is that the egg in the vertical direction is stronger than if you lay the egg down. But they proved that's not the case,\u201d said materials scientist Marc Meyers with the University of California, San Diego who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found that the egg's equator was more flexible and absorbed more of the energy of the fall before cracking. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Communications Physics.",
      "Eggs are also usually nestled top-down into homemade contraptions for egg drop challenges as part of school STEM projects, which partially inspired the new study. It's not yet clear whether the new results will help protect these vulnerable eggs, which are dropped at much loftier heights.",
      "It's a bit counterintuitive that the oblong side of an egg could hold up better against a tumble, said study co-author Tal Cohen with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "Countless broken eggs show \"the courage to go and challenge these very common, accepted notions,\u201d Cohen said.",

      "More than a dozen states are suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from for the buildout of electric vehicle chargers across the U.S. The federal lawsuit says $5 billion allocated to states under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed ...",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump 's administration for withholding billions of dollars for building more electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden \u2014 part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor. The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.",
      "The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administration's authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.",
      "\"These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation,\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it \u201cshort-sighted\u201d of Trump to revoke the funds.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t sit back while the Trump administration violates the law,\u201d Bonta, a Democrat, said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing \u2014 although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.",
      "Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.",
      "It was expected that states would fight against the federal government\u2019s efforts to slow the nation\u2019s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.",
      "Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S.",
      "Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation\u2019s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions.",
      "Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. It's a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as \u201ccharging deserts.\u201d It's also a problem for people who can't find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China.",
      "\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon \u2014 and the nation \u2014 by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,\u201d Newsom said, referencing Trump's recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.",
      "The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",

      "A new study out in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment finds that wildfires fueled by climate change are linked to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic burden",
      "Wildfires driven by climate change contribute to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs from wildfire smoke in the United States, according to a new study.",
      "The paper, published Friday in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment, found that from 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to about 15,000 deaths from exposure to small particulate matter from wildfires and cost about $160 billion. The annual range of deaths was 130 to 5,100, the study showed, with the highest in states such as Oregon and California.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more of these wildfire smoke events,\u201d said Nicholas Nassikas, a study author and a physician and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. So he and multidisciplinary team of researchers wanted to know: \"What does it really mean in a changing environment for things like mortality, which is kind of the worst possible health outcome?\u201d",
      "Lisa Thompson, a professor at Emory University who studies air pollution and climate change and was not involved in the paper, said it is one of the first studies she has seen to isolate the effect of climate change on mortality. Looking at the impacts across time and space also made it unique, she said.",
      "The paper's researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 \u2014 the main concern from wildfire smoke.",
      "These particles can lodge deep into lungs and trigger coughing and itchy eyes with short-term exposure. But longer term they can make existing health problems worse and lead to a range of chronic and deadly health issues. Children, pregnant people, the elderly and outdoor workers are among the most vulnerable. The Health Effects Institute estimated the pollutant caused 4 million deaths worldwide.",
      "Evidence is emerging that PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is more toxic than other pollution sources. When wildfires encroach into cities, burning cars and other toxics-containing materials, it adds to the danger.",
      "Numerous studies have tied human-caused climate change \u2014 caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas \u2014 to a growth in fires in North America. Global warming is increasing drought, especially in the West, and other extreme weather. Drier conditions suck moisture from plants, which act as fuel for fires. When drier vegetation and seasons are mixed with hotter temperatures, that increases the frequency, extent and severity of wildfires and the smoke they spew.",
      "Jacob Bendix, professor emeritus of geography and environment at Syracuse University, said he was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the findings but not surprised.",
      "\u201c(T) hese numbers are really significant. I think there\u2019s a tendency for people outside of the areas actually burning to see increasing fires as a distant inconvenience \u2026 This study drives home how far-reaching the impacts are,\u201d said Bendix in an email. He wasn't involved in the study.",
      "The study\u2019s authors drew on modeled and existing data to reach their findings. First, they sought to understand how much area burned by wildfires was attributable to climate change. They did that by analyzing the real climate conditions \u2014 heat and rain, for instance \u2014 when wildfires erupted from 2006 to 2020, and compared that to a scenario where weather measurements would be different without climate change.",
      "From there, they estimated the levels of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke tied to climate change using the same approach. Lastly, integrating the current understanding of how particulate matter affects mortality based on published research, they quantified the number of deaths related to PM2.5 from wildfires and calculated their economic impact.",
      "This framework showed that of 164,000 deaths related to wildfire-PM2.5 exposure from 2006 to 2020, 10% were attributable to climate change. The mortalities were 30% to 50% higher in some western states and counties.",
      "Marshall Burke, global environmental policy professor at Stanford University, said the evidence linking climate change to burned areas was \u201crock solid,\u201d but the subsequent steps were harder.",
      "\u201cLinking burned area to smoke is trickier because you never know exactly which way the wind\u2019s going to blow,\u201d he said, and he wondered how the death estimates compared to fatalities tied to general air pollution.",
      "Still, their approach was sensible and reasonable, Burke said.",
      "Johns Hopkins University lecturer in climate and energy policy Patrick Brown said he had some concerns about the study. One was conceptual. The study acknowledges the power non-climate drivers have on wildfires, but it doesn't give them proper weight, he said in an email.",
      "Brown, who was not involved in the study, worries decision-makers could wrongly conclude that mitigating planet-warming carbon emissions is the only solution. \u201cYet in many regions, the more immediate life\u2011saving action may be fuel breaks, prescribed burns, ignition\u2011source regulation, public health efforts, etc.,\u201d he said.",
      "Land management practices such as prescribed burns can reduce wildfire fuel, Nassikas said. But ultimately, the study notes, the problem of deaths from wildfire smoke will only get worse without the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cPart of the study is raising awareness,\" he said. \u201cAnd then once we kind of understand that \u2026 now what are the interventions that we can deploy at a personal level, at a community level, and then obviously at a larger level across the country and across the world?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Skype users are scrambling to find an alternative after Microsoft shut down the pioneering internet phone service which let people make cheap long distance calls and chat with other users",
      "LONDON -- Skype is dead. What now?",
      "Microsoft's shutdown of Skype on May 5 sent millions of users scrambling to find an alternative to the pioneering internet phone service.",
      "Skype, which Microsoft bought in 2011, was beloved by a dwindling group of users who appreciated how it let them make cheap long-distance calls as well as communicate with other users through chat messages, voice or video calls.",
      "Some liked its simplicity and ease of use \u2014 an advantage, for example, when setting up a communications app for an elderly parent living far away.",
      "Or they just used it out of habit.",
      "Skype was founded in 2003 and was among the first in a wave of communication services that used voice over internet protocol technology (VoIP), which converts audio into a digital signal.",
      "Skype's disappearance also inconveniences Americans and other expatriates living overseas who signed up because they needed an U.S.-based number to receive text authentication codes from, say, a bank back home. It was also handy for calling 800 numbers for free even if you weren't living in North America.",
      "Here is a guide for life after Skype:",
      "Microsoft announced in late February that it was shutting down Skype on May 5 and shifting some of its services to Microsoft Teams, its flagship office videoconferencing and group collaboration platform.",
      "Skype users can use their existing accounts to log into Teams and have the option to automatically migrate their contacts and chats.",
      "If you had a Skype number or a calling subscription, it stopped automatically renewing on April 3.",
      "If your account still has credit, you can access Skype's dial pad from the web portal or Teams to make calls.",
      "Skype numbers won't immediately expire on May 5 so you'll still be able to receive calls until your subscription expires. But you'll have to use Teams or keep the Skype dial pad open on the web portal to receive them.",
      "If your Skype number hasn't expired and you don't want to lose it, you should transfer it to another provider.",
      "Skype numbers can be ported to a phone carrier or any number of other VoIP services. But you'll have to start the process through the new provider, not Skype.",
      "Google users can access the online search giant's internet phone service to make calls from a smartphone or a desktop web browser. You can get your own Google Voice phone number and use features like call forwarding and voicemail. Or you can port your number from another service like Skype, but it will cost $20.",
      "Calls to U.S., Canadian or Puerto Rican numbers are free. Rates for other countries vary.",
      "The free version of Google Voice is only available to U.S. residents physically located in the 48 contiguous states, so that means expatriate Americans can only use it if they registered before they moved overseas.",
      "\u201cYou cannot sign up for a Google Voice number while outside the USA,\u201d according to a help page. \u201cDo not try to circumvent this by using a VPN.\u201d",
      "Owned by Japan's Rakuten, Viber was long considered one of the closest competitors to Skype. One key difference is that Skype users don't need a phone number and are identified by their usernames, while Viber users need a number to register for service.",
      "Similar to Skype, Viber users can buy credit or packages to call phone numbers around the world but it's no longer possible to get a Viber number to receive calls.",
      "The videoconferencing service that\u2019s become a byword for online company meetings offers a calling service, Zoom Phone, and features like number porting and the ability to send and receive SMS text messages.",
      "Take note that Zoom Phone isn't free. There are various calling plans that involve a monthly subscription cost and extra fees for international calls.",
      "Microsoft users have the option of making calls on Teams, dubbed Teams Phone. Like Zoom Phone, you'll need to buy a subscription and pay extra for international calls.",
      "But it's not an option for regular people because Microsoft says Teams Phone isn't for consumer use and is only available to small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "If you absolutely need a U.S. number but live overseas, sign up for service with a low-cost virtual wireless carrier that offers cheap cellphone plans or pay-as-you-go rates.",
      "One provider, Tello, offers monthly plans for as little as $5 and says users can activate its service even if they're living outside the U.S.",
      "Because mobile virtual network operators like Tello are essentially wireless phone companies that piggyback off a bigger carrier's physical network, you can't use it to make calls on a computer or an app.",
      "There are a slew of Skype pretenders offering phone calls over the internet, such as Zoiper, VoIP.ms, CallCentric, Mytello, and Virtual Landline. Many are aimed at business users.",
      "Some are capitalizing on Skype\u2019s disappearance. Hushed, which started as an anonymous calling app, bills itself as a Skype alternative. Users can buy a phone number from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom or Puerto Rico or port their own number.",
      "It warns that some of its numbers aren't guaranteed to work with third-party verification text messages.",
      "\u201cWe do not intentionally block anyone from receiving these codes, but it\u2019s common that some services will prevent verification texts from being sent to certain phone numbers due to their own security policies,\" Hushed says on its website.",
      "Maybe you can't decide which calling service you want to switch to. If you want to save your current number, there are services to just park your number like NumberBarn.com and Parkmyphone.com.",
      "They let you store a phone number for a monthly fee while relaying any text messages sent to that number. You can port the number to another service whenever you want.",
      "Beware, you can only port in U.S. or Canadian phone numbers.",
      "What about an international eSIM? They're the virtual version of the mobile phone SIM card that you can buy and add to your phone when you're on a trip to save on roaming fees.",
      "They offer cheap data access rates so you can use the internet without worrying about racking up a huge bill when you get home.",
      "Unfortunately, you can't port a Skype number to an international eSIM because of \u201cthe fundamental differences\" between VoIP services and traditional mobile networks, said Pedro Maiquez, co-founder of eSIM provider Holafly. \u201cSkype numbers are not tied to a mobile carrier\u2019s physical infrastructure, making them incompatible with mobile eSIM solutions.\"",

      "The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking it to give up the underlying technology powering the company\u2019s digital ad network",
      "The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking it to give up the underlying technology powering the company's digital ad network. The proposed remedy joins a separate federal effort to separate the Chrome browser from its dominant search engine.",
      "The government's latest proposal was filed late Monday in a Virginia federal court two-and-half weeks after a federal judge ruled that parts of its lucrative digital ad network have been improperly abusing its market power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers.",
      "In a 17-page filing, Justice Department lawyers argued that U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema should punish Google by ordering the company to offload its AdX business and DFP ad platform, tools that bring together advertisers, who want to market their products, and publishers, who want to sell commercial space on their sites, to bring in revenue.",
      "Not surprisingly, it's an idea that Google vehemently plans to oppose when the penalty phase of the antitrust case \u2014known as remedy hearings \u2014 begins in late September. Google already has vowed to appeal Brinkema's ruling that the technology powering the ad network has been breaking the law, but can't do that until the judge rules on its punishment in a decision expected late this year or early next year.",
      "Google said in its own filing Monday that divestiture of AdX and DFP wouldn\u2019t be technically feasible because neither piece of technology is capable of working outside of Google's proprietary infrastructure. The company proposed its own remedies to restore competition, and reiterated its intent to appeal the ruling.",
      "\u201cDivestiture is not as simple as selling either the AdX or DFP source code to a willing buyer,\u201d Google wrote.",
      "The attempt to tear down Google's ad network comes on top of the Justice Department's ongoing effort to have the company part with its popular Chrome browser and impose other restrictions to curtail the power of its ubiquitous search engine, which another federal judge branded an illegal monopoly in a ruling last August.",
      "The remedy hearings in the search case are scheduled to conclude later this month, with a ruling from U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta expected by Labor Day.",
      "If the Justice Department is able to persuade the two different judges to order its proposed dismantling of Google, it would be the biggest breakup of a U.S. company since AT&T was forced to spin off its phone service into seven separate regional companies more than 40 years ago.",
      "Google's Play Store for apps running on its Android software that powers most of the world's smartphones also was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal jury in 2023 and is battling a judge's order that would require it to overhaul a commission system that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue.",
      "But hobbling its search engine and digital ad network would be far bigger blows because they are the key cogs in a business that generated $265 billion in revenue last year.",
      "Google is confronting the breakup threats at the same time the advent of artificial intelligence is changing the way consumers are using technology and seeking information online \u2014 a shift that could also siphon traffic and money away from a powerhouse that began in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Despite the adversity, Google is still delivering robust financial growth to its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., which is currently valued at $2 trillion.",

      "\u201cI guess I don\u2019t understand why someone is compelled to want to drive that fast,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cBut if they choose to drive that fast with the speed limiter, they can\u2019t. It's going to stop them in their tracks.\u201d",
      "The measure, which Washington legislators passed last month and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson is expected to soon sign, is called the BEAM Act, using the first letters of the names of the four victims: Buster, Eloise, Andrea and Matilda.",
      "Because Jones, 19, didn't receive a speeding ticket in his two previous crashes, he likely wouldn't have been required to use the speed-limiter ahead of the fatal one. And because it could be 2029 before the law takes effect, the judge's requirement at sentencing only applies to his time on probation after being released from prison, Smith said.",

      "When court-mandated, the devices would prevent cars from exceeding speed limits or whatever threshold regulators set. An override button allows speeding in emergencies, but states can decide whether to activate it and authorities would be alerted any time the button is pushed.",
      "A more passive version, which beeps to alert drivers when they are going too fast, is required for new cars in the European Union. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a similar proposal last year, explaining vehicle safety requirements are set by the federal government and he was concerned a patchwork of state laws could stir confusion.",
      "Before Del. Patrick Hope agreed to sponsor the proposal in the Virginia Legislature, he tried out the device in Nannini's car, which was calibrated to not go more than 9 mph (14 kph) over the speed limit.",
      "\u201cThat was my first question: Is it safe?\u201d Hope said.",
      "Not only did he come away convinced it was safe, Hope is now pondering whether to install it on the cars of his three children, all of whom are new drivers.",
      "For those mandated by a court, the price could be hefty: $4 per day and a $100 installation fee. The fee would be reduced for low-income offenders.",
      "Cohen with Families for Safe Streets, which provides support services to the loved ones of crash victims, knows firsthand the kind of impact slowing down speeders can make. A year after her son was struck and killed in front of their New York apartment, another boy was injured in the same spot.",
      "By then, the road's speed limit had been lowered.",
      "\u201cThat boy lived when he was hit, and mine did not,\u201d she said. \"When you are going a few miles slower, there's more time to stop. And when you hit somebody, it's much less likely to be deadly.\u201d",

    "summary": "President Trump poised to accept \"palace in the sky\" as a gift from Qatar: Sources",
    "story": [
      "The luxury jumbo jet is to be used as Air Force One, sources told ABC News.",
      "In what may be the most valuable gift ever extended to the United States from a foreign government, the Trump administration is preparing to accept a super luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar -- a gift that is to be available for use by President Donald Trump as the new Air Force One until shortly before he leaves office, at which time ownership of the plane will be transferred to the Trump presidential library foundation, sources familiar with the proposed arrangement told ABC News.",
      "The gift is expected to be announced next week, when Trump visits Qatar on the first foreign trip of his second term, according to sources familiar with the plans.",
      "Trump toured the plane, which is so opulently configured it is known as \"a flying palace,\" while it was parked at the West Palm Beach International Airport in February.",
      "The highly unusual -- unprecedented -- arrangement is sure to raise questions about whether it is legal for the Trump administration, and ultimately, the Trump presidential library foundation, to accept such a valuable gift from a foreign power.",
      "Anticipating those questions, sources told ABC News that lawyers for the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice drafted an analysis for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth concluding that is legal for the Department of Defense to accept the aircraft as a gift and later turn it over to the Trump library, and that it does not violate laws against bribery or the Constitution's prohibition (the emoluments clause) of any U.S. government official accepting gifts \"from any King, Prince or foreign State.\"",
      "Sources told ABC News that Attorney General Pam Bondi and Trump's top White House lawyer David Warrington concluded it would be \"legally permissible\" for the donation of the aircraft to be conditioned on transferring its ownership to Trump's presidential library before the end of his term, according to sources familiar with their determination.",
      "The sources said Bondi provided a legal memorandum addressed to the White House counsel's office last week after Warrington asked her for advice on the legality of the Pentagon accepting such a donation.",
      "The White House and DOJ didn't immediately respond to request for comment. A spokesperson for the Qatari embassy did not respond to ABC's inquiries.",
      "The plane will initially be transferred to the United States Air Force, which will modify the 13-year-old aircraft to meet the U.S. military specifications required for any aircraft used to transport the president of the United States, multiple sources familiar with the proposed arrangement said.",
      "The plane will then be transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation no later than Jan. 1, 2029, and any costs relating to its transfer will be paid for by the U.S. Air Force, the sources told ABC News.",
      "According to aviation industry experts, the estimated value of the aircraft Trump will inherit is about $400 million, and that's without the additional communications security equipment the Air Force will need to add to properly secure and outfit the plane in order to safely transport the commander in chief.",
      "As the Wall Street Journal first reported, the aviation company L3Harris has already been commissioned to overhaul the plane to meet the requirements of a presidential jet.",
      "Both the White House and DOJ concluded that because the gift is not conditioned on any official act, it does not constitute bribery, the sources said. Bondi's legal analysis also says it does not run afoul of the Constitution's prohibition on foreign gifts because the plane is not being given to an individual, but rather to the United States Air Force and, eventually, to the presidential library foundation, the sources said.",
      "The primary aircraft used in the current Air Force One fleet includes two aging Boeing 747-200 jumbo jets that have been operational since 1990. The Air Force contract with Boeing to replace those aircraft has been riddled with delays and cost overruns.",
      "The original contract was signed in 2018, but as of last year, Boeing anticipated the aircraft would not be ready until 2029, after Trump leaves office.",
      "The president has expressed deep frustration with the delays, tasking Elon Musk to work with Boeing and the Air Force to speed up the process. Those efforts have been modestly successful. Boeing's most recent estimated delivery date is now 2027, but Trump has made it clear he wants a new plane this year.",

      "The president has expressed frustration with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin over the failure of U.S.-led peace efforts.",
      "Trump's latest remarks come after Putin announced a unilateral three-day ceasefire covering Russia's Victory Day celebrations, marking the anniversary of the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. Ukraine -- which did not agree to the ceasefire -- said Russian forces repeatedly violated Putin's proposed pause in fighting. Putin's ceasefire ended on Saturday.",
      "Zelenskyy instead offered a full 30-day ceasefire. On Sunday, following talks with the leaders of the U.K., France, Germany and Poland in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that he and his fellow leaders agreed that \"a complete and unconditional ceasefire\" should begin on May 12.",
      "Putin has not agreed to Zelenskyy's proposal, though in a Sunday statement offered direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday.",
      "\"Russia is ready for negotiations without any preconditions,\" Putin said in a statement. \"There is fighting going on right now, a war, and we are proposing to resume the negotiations that were interrupted not by us. What's wrong with that? Those who truly want peace cannot fail to support this.\"",
      "In response, Zelenskyy said in a post to Telegram that Putin's offer was \"a positive sign.\"",
      "\"The very first step in the real end of any war is a ceasefire,\" the Ukrainian president added. \"There is no point in continuing the killings even for a day. We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire -- complete, lasting and reliable -- starting tomorrow, May 12, and Ukraine is ready to meet.\"",

      "The move to expel migrants would curtail a constitutional right to due process.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Friday that the Trump administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, the right of a person to challenge their detention in court.",
      "If carried out by President Donald Trump, the suspension of habeas corpus would be a dramatic escalation of his administration's immigration policy by significantly curtailing a right enshrined in the Constitution.",
      "\"First, you know, President Trump has talked about potentially suspending habeas corpus to take care of the illegal immigration problem. When could we see that happen in the future?\" a reporter asked Miller as he spoke outside the White House.",
      "\"The Constitution is clear, and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in time of invasion,\" Miller answered.",
      "\"So, it's an option we're actively looking at,\" he continued.",
      "The Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus in extraordinary circumstances, Article I saying writs of habeas corpus \"shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\"",
      "According to the National Constitution Center, the United States has suspended habeas corpus four times in the past -- during the Civil War, during Reconstruction in South Carolina, in the Philippines during a 1905 insurrection, and in Hawaii in 1941 after Pearl Harbor was bombed by Japan during World War II.",
      "Miller justified the potential suspension of habeas corpus by arguing the United States is currently facing a national security threat by undocumented migrants \"invading\" the United States.",

      "But two separate federal judges, including one appointed by Trump, said the use of the Alien Enemies act was unlawful because the Trump administration did not prove United States is being invaded by Tren de Aragua.",
      "Miller said that the administration's decision would come down to whether the \"courts do the right thing or not.\"",
      "But legal experts say the issue is not as cut and dried as Miller suggests, and that a president cannot suspend habeas corpus without authorization from Congress.",
      "\"Miller also doesn't deign to mention that the near-universal consensus is that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus -- and that unilateral suspensions by the President are per se unconstitutional,\" Georgetown University Law Center professor Steve Vladeck writes in his Substack blog.",
      "\"He's suggesting that the administration would (unlawfully) suspend habeas corpus if (but apparently only if) it disagrees with how courts rule in these cases. In other words, it's not the judicial review itself that's imperiling national security; it's the possibility that the government might lose. That's not, and has never been, a viable argument for suspending habeas corpus,\" he writes.",
      "President Abraham Lincoln famously suspended the writ of habeas corpus at the outbreak of the Civil War.",
      "But then-Chief Justice Roger Taney deemed the move unlawful, noting the operative clause is found in Article I of the Constitution, which itemizes Congress' powers, not the president's.",

We were met with contempt, disrespect, and aggression from ICE. From roughing up members of congress to arresting the mayor of our state's largest city, there is no version of today that does not show the blatant abuses of power of the Trump administration,\" she said in a statement.",

      "Baraka and three members of the congressional delegation for New Jersey -- Democratic Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver, and Robert Menendez Jr. -- had gone to the Delaney Hall immigration detention facility to conduct oversight, according to Watson Coleman and McIver.",

      "Menendez said, \"Over 20 armed ICE officers with the entire brass from the Newark office\" walked past them toward the gate where Baraka was.",
      "\"It was clearly intended to intimidate not just the mayor, but the three of us and everyone watching today,\" he said.",
      "A defiant McIver told reporters, \"We're going to keep fighting. This is not going to stop us from fighting and doing our job that over thousands of New Jerseyans elected us to do. We were simply doing our job, and it has nothing to do with politics.\"",
      "The city of Newark had alleged the Delaney Hall detention facility was opened without proper safety protocols.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a press release on Friday that the Delaney Hall, which is a privately operated facility with which ICE contracts to hold migrants, has proper permitting and said immigrants lacking legal status to be in the United States who have committed violent crimes are being held there.",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy criticized Baraka's arrest in a statement Friday afternoon.",
      "\"Mayor Baraka is an exemplary public servant who has always stood up for our most vulnerable neighbors. I am calling for his immediate release by federal law enforcement,\" he wrote.",

      "\"Members of Congress storming into a detention facility goes beyond a bizarre political stunt and puts the safety of our law enforcement agents and detainees at risk,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Watson Coleman also disputed the department's characterization of their visit: \"Contrary to a press statement put out by DHS we did not 'storm' the detention center. The author of that press release was so unfamiliar with the facts on the ground that they didn't even correctly count the number of Representatives present. We were exercising our legal oversight function as we have done at the Elizabeth Detention Center without incident,\" she wrote in a statement.",
      "Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who served as the mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013, said the incident \"is disturbing, unnecessary and indicative of tactics that are undermining the safety and security of our communities, not adding to it. Law enforcement officers should have deescalated this situation. Mayor Baraka should be immediately released.\"",
      "New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin said in a statement, \"Arresting public officials for peacefully protesting violates the most basic principles of our democracy. The arrest of Mayor Baraka earlier this afternoon outside Delaney Hall in Newark is deeply troubling. People peacefully exercising their right to free speech and assembly should never be targeted for opposing the government's policies.\"",

      "\"Like those gathered today to protest outside of Delaney Hall, my office has remained steadfast in our defense of the state law prohibiting private immigration detention centers in our communities. We defended that law before a federal appeals court last week, and we will continue to stand up for the civil rights of our residents,\" Platkin wrote.",
      "New Jersey Republican Party Chairman Bob Hugin, however, criticized Baraka and called his actions a \"stunt.\"",
      "\"Mayor Ras Baraka's arrest after trespassing at a federal ICE facility and ignoring repeated warnings from Homeland Security is unprofessional, reckless, and dangerous. He's not just a mayor -- he's running for Governor, and this stunt shows exactly what kind of leader he'd be: one who puts political theater ahead of public safety and the rule of law,\" Hugin wrote.",

NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election! In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I'm OK if they do!!!\" Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Trump's position on raising taxes for the rich \"very honorable\" during Friday's White House press briefing.",
      "\"The president himself has said he wouldn't mind paying a little bit more to help the poor and the middle class and the working class in this country,\" Leavitt said. \"These negotiations are ongoing on Capitol Hill and the president will weigh in when he feels necessary.\"",
      "The ambiguous presidential declaration has thrown negotiators into a frantic scramble -- with the House Ways and Means committee expected to mark up their legislation next week.",
      "The inclusion of a tax hike in the \"big, beautiful bill\" would be a major reversal for House GOP leaders, who have argued that allowing the current tax rates to expire would amount to a tax increase.",
      "\"I'm not in favor of raising the tax rates because that's -- our party is the group that stands against that, traditionally,\" Speaker Mike Johnson said in an interview on Fox News in late April.",
      "During his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in 1992, incumbent President George H.W. Bush uttered the infamous line, \"read my lips: no new taxes.\" Voters ultimately rejected Bush at the ballot box after he broke his vow and signed legislation crafted by congressional Democrats that increased tax revenues to address the growing budget deficit.",

    "summary": "The move comes a day before U.S.-China trade negotiations are set to begin.",
    "story": [
      "The move comes a day before U.S.-China trade negotiations are set to begin.",
      "President Donald Trump on Friday voiced a willingness to ease tariffs on China, saying on social media it \"seems right\" to slash levies from 145% to 80%.",
      "The announcement arrives a day before Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to begin trade negotiations with Chinese officials at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.",
      "The potential tariff reduction floated by Trump may avert a virtual standstill of trade between the world's two largest economies, but the move would not substantially ease expected price increases for goods such as clothes, sneakers and toys, analysts told ABC News.",
      "Product shortages would also remain a possibility at the lower tariff rate, they added.",
      "\"A tariff of 80% would still have a dramatic effect,\" Christian vom Lehn, an economics professor at Brigham Young University, told ABC News. \"It would mean a significant impact for consumers.\"",
      "Trump last month sharply increased tariffs on China, prompting China to retaliate with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. The tit-for-tat measures set off a trade war with the third-largest U.S. trade partner, which accounted for nearly $440 billion worth of imports last year.",
      "The tariffs elicited warnings from a slew of companies about the risk of price increases for U.S shoppers.",
      "Toy giant Mattel warned in an earnings report this week of plans to shift some of its supply chain outside China, adding that when necessary it would take \"pricing action in its U.S. business.\" The move follows similar messages from electronics chain Best Buy as well as Chinese e-commerce retailers Shein and Temu.",
      "Chinese shipments to the U.S. have dropped significantly, falling 21% in April compared to a year earlier, data from China's General Administration of Customs on Friday showed.",
      "Risks for consumers would continue to linger for two key reasons, analysts said: An 80% tariff would still amount to a punishing tax on imports, while uncertainty about the chance of another policy shift would make it difficult for companies to take full advantage of the lower rate.",
      "Tariffs raise prices for consumers if importers fail to swallow the tax burden by eating into their profits or requesting a supplier sell the product at a lower rate in order to offset a share of the cost.",
      "Under the current 145% tariff on Chinese goods, suppliers and importers face immense pressure as they try to bear some of the tax cost out of concern that higher prices would hurt sales, experts told ABC News. Due to the sky-high tariff, however, many sellers have little choice but to hike prices or risk losses, they added.",
      "Those dynamics would remain in place at an 80% tariff rate, since it would still far exceed many companies' capacity to offset the added cost with lower profits, \u200b\u200bJason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.",
      "\"An 80% tariff really doesn't change things too much,\" Miller said.",
      "Trump's announcement of a potential reduction of the tariff on China came two days after Trump ruled out any such lowering of the tariff level before negotiations.",
      "The developments followed a weeks-long back and forth during which the two sides disputed whether they had already started discussing the tariffs.",
      "The general sense of uncertainty would remain even after U.S. tariffs were to reach 80%, making it difficult for businesses to adapt their supply chains in a manner that would substantially ease costs and, in turn, offer relief for consumers, some analysts said.",
      "\"Even at a lower tariff, companies would have to be wondering whether this might go up again or or possibly come down again,\" David Andolfatto, an economist at the University of Miami, told ABC News.",
      "If companies could trust the possible 80% tariff level as a long-term policy stance, they may choose to reroute supply chains outside China or even initiate plans for some domestic production, Andolfatto said.",
      "But each trade policy announcement put forward by Trump appears subject to change, Andolfatto said, noting several modifications already undertaken by Trump.",
      "\"If anything changes, the Trump administration can unilaterally react and come back to the negotiating table,\" Andolfatto added.",
      "For his part, Bessent has referred to the White House approach as a negotiating tactic, describing the policy changes as \"strategic uncertainty.\"",
      "Testifying before a House subcommittee this week, Bessent said the Trump administration had commenced negotiations with 17 of the top 18 U.S. trade partners, excluding China. Those countries account for the vast majority of U.S. foreign trade, Bessent said.",
      "Trump unveiled the framework for a trade agreement with the United Kingdom on Thursday, marking the first such accord with any nation since the White House suspended some of its far-reaching \"Liberation Day\" tariffs last month.",
      "\"Every country wants to be making deals,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday, noting the upcoming talks between Bessent and Chinese officials.",
      "\"That will be very interesting,\" Trump said.",

      "Leo XIV was elected as the 267th pontiff on Thursday.",
      "One day after the election of Pope Leo XIV, the first pontiff from the U.S., seven American cardinals sat down with reporters on Friday to discuss the Chicago native who now leads the Roman Catholic Church and how he will follow the footsteps of Pope Francis, but not as a \"photocopy.\"",
      "The cardinals that gathered -- Daniel DiNardo, Timothy Dolan, Joseph Tobin, Blase Cupich, Wilton Gregory, Robert McElroy and Christophe Pierre -- agreed that all members of the clergy worked effectively together to elect a pontiff that would follow Pope Francis, who died on April 21.",
      "\"It was an amazing opportunity to see such a diverse assembly of humanity coming from many different perspectives, facing many different challenges, but coming together for a common purpose to find Peter's successor, and I think we did well,\" Gregory, the archbishop emeritus of Washington, said during the press conference at the Pontifical North American College in Rome.",
      "Tune into \"The American Pope: Leo XIV,\" a special edition of \"20/20,\" on Friday night at 9 p.m. ET/8 p.m. CT on ABC, and streaming later on Hulu and Disney+",
      "Several of the cardinals admitted they were surprised an American was selected, including Robert McElroy -- archbishop of Washington -- who \"always thought it would be impossible.\"",
      "But Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said he did not think the fact that Leo was from the U.S. \"carried much weight\" in the decision to elect him as the 267th leader of the church.",
      "He also suggested that Leo's election wasn't a reaction to President Donald Trump.",
      "\"I don't think at all my brother cardinals would have thought of him as a counterweight to any one person,\" he said.",
      "Regarding remarks made earlier by Cardinal Maung Bo -- who said Leo will \"build a bridge\" with Trump -- Dolan said the new pontiff will instead \"build bridges with leaders of every nation.\"",
      "Dolan said Leo's potential meeting with Trump would \"not be of more heft\" than conversations with other world leaders.",
      "Overall, Gregory --\u00a0who agreed with Dolan's suggestion that American politics had nothing to do with the decision to elect Leo --\u00a0told reporters the cardinals were attempting to elect someone who could lead the Catholic Church and could answer these questions: \"Who among us can bring us together? Who among us can strengthen the faith and bring the faith to places it has grown weak?\"",
      "During the conclave itself, Gregory said Leo engaged in conversations with members of the clergy in \"smaller groups,\" specifically during meal times and coffee breaks.",
      "\"It wasn't like he got up and made an overwhelmingly convincing speech that wowed the body,\" Gregory said.",
      "Cardinal Robert McElroy, archbishop of Washington, said it was not the substance of what Leo said during the conclave, but the \"manner in which he said it\" that resonated with the cardinals.",
      "Tobin, archbishop of Newark, described a moment during the conclave, when he saw Leo, formerly Cardinal Robert Prevost, with \"his head in his hands\" after realizing he could possibly become pope.",
      "\"I was praying for him, because I couldn't imagine what happens to a human being when you're facing something like that, and then when he accepted it, it was like he was made for it,\" Tobin said. \"All of whatever anguish was resolved by the feeling that, I think, that this wasn't simply his saying yes to a proposal, but God would make something clear.\"",
      "The clergy also noticed that Leo had the mind of Pope Benedict and the \"missionary zeal\" of Francis, Dolan said. Similarly, McElroy said Leo has the \"same type of freedom that is in his heart and soul that was in Francis,\" but the new pontiff may not express that freedom in the same manner.",
      "\"We are looking for someone following the pathway, but we are not looking for a photocopy,\" McElroy said.",
      "Gregory, who said he spoke to Leo during the conclave about how they are both from Chicago, advised the world to give the new pope patience as he grows into this role, joking that he has only been in this position for a day.",
      "\"He's never been pope before,\" Gregory said. \"Pope Leo will surprise us as he brings his gifts, confronts the challenges and responds in grace to the needs of the church.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sens. Banks and Warren are asking the department to look deeper into the issue.",
      "A bipartisan pair of senators applauded the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into major egg producers over rising prices and called on the department to look even further into the issue in a letter to Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater late Thursday evening.",
      "\"We write to express support for the Department of Justice's reported investigation into anticompetitive practices in the U.S. egg industry,\" Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Republican Sen. Jim Banks wrote. \"As you are aware, the sustained increase in egg prices has placed a significant financial strain on American families, particularly workingclass households. While egg producers and trade associations point to recent avian flu outbreaks as the cause of high prices, we are concerned that record high egg prices reflect noncompetitive behavior among large producers.\"",
      "ABC News reported in March that the Department of Justice was in the early stages of investigating major egg producers over soaring egg prices. Sources told ABC News at the time that department investigators were looking into whether the major egg companies were sharing information about supply and pricing, possibly contributing to price increases.",
      "The average retail price of a dozen eggs climbed from $4.95 in January to $6.22 in March, the most recent month for which data is available, per Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That amounts to a 25% increase in consumer cost.",
      "By contrast, wholesale prices of eggs are falling. The average price of a dozen large white eggs was $3.69 over the week ending May 3, the most recent week available, according to Department of Agriculture data. Over the week ending Jan. 17 -- the last week of data before Trump took office -- the average price of a dozen large white eggs stood at $6.14, data showed. That's a nearly 40% decline.",
      "Egg producers, including the industry's trade association, have said that the hike in consumer egg costs is due to the avian flu. But in their letter, the senators cast doubt on this claim and encourage the Department of Justice to continue its efforts to determine whether \"noncompetitive behavior among large producers\" could be to blame.",
      "\"Egg prices began to drop from their record peaks only after the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched an investigation into whether large egg producers had engaged in anticompetitive practices to raise egg prices or restrict egg supply,\" Banks and Warren write. \"Large egg producers and trade associations have previously been found liable for price fixing. Given this history, we urge DOJ to thoroughly review whether recent trends in egg prices reflect impermissible coordination among egg producers and trade associations.\"",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Warren said Americans deserve answers over the cause of rising cost of eggs at the grocery store.",
      "\"While rising egg prices are hurting working families, giant egg producers are raking in record profits. Americans deserve to know if those sky-high prices are the result of out-of-control corporate greed. We're pressing the Justice Department to get answers,\" Warren said.",
      "Banks said the egg industry is \"long overdue\" for an antitrust investigation.",
      "\"America\u2019s egg industry has been controlled by a handful of companies for years, and it\u2019s long overdue for an antitrust investigation to bring down prices and create more competition,\" Banks said. \"I fully support the Department of Justice\u2019s probe into whether these companies have exploited the avian flu outbreak to manipulate prices.\u201d",
      "The ballooning cost of eggs was an ongoing political flashpoint during the 2024 presidential race. Then-candidate Donald Trump made lowering the cost of groceries a cornerstone of his campaign. Since returning to the Oval Office, he's often spoken about egg prices and in recent days, he's touted repeatedly that egg prices are lower because of his leadership.",
      "\"Gas is down, gasoline is down, energy is down, groceries are down, eggs are down. Eggs, thank you very much. But eggs are down,\" Trump said during remarks in the Oval office on Thursday.",
      "Warren and Banks say the cost of eggs continues to be a burden on American families.",
      "\"The sustained increase in egg prices has placed a significant financial strain on American families, particularly workingclass households,\" they write. \"Eggs have long been an affordable staple in Americans' diets. Yet, the cost of eggs reached an unprecedented high this year.\"",
      "The senators said that they \"support\" the DOJ investigation into the behavior of egg producers and urged the agency to consider whether a \"precipitous drop\" in egg prices just \"days\" after news of the investigation broke suggest that egg producers had conspired to artificially inflate prices.",
      "They also seek additional information from DOJ by mid-May about whether egg prices can be reasonably explained by bird flu, what sort of profit increases were seen by large egg producers, and whether DOJ analysis shows a sudden price decrease in eggs following the announcement of its investigation.",

    "story": [
      "Some Democrats say Biden relitigating his campaign is stagnating the party.",
      "Former President Joe Biden has reemerged into the public eye with two back-to-back sit-down interviews, sharing his diagnosis of the Democrats' stinging election losses, defending his mental acuity, which was fiercely questioned at the end of his term, and all the while defining his version of his more than three-decades-long political legacy.",
      "And while some Democrats say there is \"a place for Joe Biden at the table,\" others say it's better for him to be out of the spotlight and that relitigating his campaign is stagnating the party.",
      "Speaking to ABC's \"The View\" on Thursday, Biden took responsibility for President Donald Trump's historic return to the White House and pushed back on claims of cognitive decline in his final year in office. He also addressed his next steps, saying he was \"getting squared away trying to figure out what the most significant and consequential role I can play, consistent with what I've done in the past.\"",
      "Part of that reflection will come in the form of a book that he said he is beginning to write now. But some Democrats are torn as to whether the book and a few media appearances are where they'd like his contributions to end.",
      "Long-time allies of the former president told ABC News that they welcome Biden's return and advocate for him to staunchly defend and define his reputation and accomplishments publicly.",
      "\"He has a responsibility and certainly the right to defend his record. Biden would be beyond crazy just to quietly let his record get misrepresented as it has been done all last week,\" Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn told ABC News. Clyburn said he was unable to watch Biden on \"The View,\" but was \"glad\" to see Biden out there.",
      "Former Democratic National Committee Chair Jamie Harrison also said he was heartened by Biden's recent appearances -- another of which was with the BBC earlier this week.",
      "\"Seeing Joe Biden reminds me that our president can be a good, decent and honest leader. Reminds me that we have had presidents with slight majorities that have legislated to protect the environment, stabilized and grown the economy, created new jobs, reduced the cost of health care, invested in our infrastructure and respected our nation's history. I will always be grateful to President Biden for his commitment to saving America in one of our darkest times,\" said Harrison.",
      "Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, former interim DNC chair, said she welcomed Biden back into the public square and pointed to Trump's frequent invocation of the former president as a principal reason why Biden ought to respond.",
      "Brazile, a current ABC News contributor, added that Biden stayed relatively quiet during Trump's first 100 days in office this term, honoring an unwritten presidential tradition, and stressed that Biden deserves a platform.",
      "\"There's a place for Joe Biden at the table, and we should acknowledge that,\" Brazile said. \"Just because you're a former president doesn't mean that you have to somehow or another disappear. Former presidents have every right to speak up.\"",
      "Brazile did have one concern: that the party would look to only one voice to take cues from in this period of rebuilding -- a habit she said she finds unwise. Instead, Brazile said she hopes this becomes a time when a \"new group of leaders\" emerge.",
      "Ken Martin, the current chair of the DNC, expressed gratitude for Biden in a statement to ABC: \"No Democratic president has invested more in the Party's infrastructure than Joe Biden, and I'm deeply grateful for the President's service not only to our nation but his ongoing service to the Party.\"",
      "Jamie Selzler, a DNC member from North Dakota and former executive director of the state's Democratic party, disagreed with some points Biden raised in his interview on \"The View,\" particularly that he could have prevailed over Trump.",
      "Still Selzer along with other Democrats say that despite their breaks from Biden's view of campaigns past, feel that he should be some part of the party's future.",
      "\"We need more voices in this fight, not fewer, and President Biden's voice is a welcome one,\" Selzer said.",
      "Other blocs of the party are far more critical, with some Democrats telling ABC News that they find the former president's foray defensive and a misguided distraction.",
      "One Democratic strategist said they believe Biden is mishandling his role and stagnating the party.",
      "As long as the conversations revolve around Biden, the strategist, who has experience in Congress and presidential campaigns, said, \"we cannot move forward as a country or a party.\"",
      "\"He's not really telling his own story. He's just fighting with everyone else about their telling of his story,\" the strategist said.",
      "This strategist said they believe that Biden should follow in the less vocal post-White House footsteps of former presidents such as Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. This person said Biden should focus his attention on his eventual presidential library and foundation.",
      "\"These first 100 days, these first six months, like this first calendar year, it's all going to be political questions. You don't have to answer those anymore. You actually shouldn't be answering those anymore,\" the strategist said of Biden. \"Democrats talk a lot about how Donald Trump has ruined norms. Joe Biden is kind of ruining a lot of norms with how to be an ex-president right now.\"",
      "Senior Democratic strategist Sawyer Hackett told ABC News that while Biden is entitled to defend his legacy, relitigating campaign losses, or in his estimation, \"rewriting political history,\" is wholly unhelpful and stressed the party is in desperate need to move forward.",
      "\"The Democratic Party is working to claw itself out of the political wilderness we were left in under the stewardship of Joe Biden. It's utterly delusional and extremely unhelpful for Biden to wax poetic about how he could have beaten Trump, given the dire straits he left our coalition in,\" said Hackett.",
      "To Hackett, Biden will best serve fellow Democrats from the wings.",
      "\"The most consequential role Biden can play is one off stage, far from the spotlight of domestic politics,\" he said.",

      "NEW YORK -- News that the global Catholic church would get its first-ever U.S.-born pope was welcomed by Catholics across the ideological spectrum in Pope Leo XIV \u2019s homeland, raising the question of whether he might be able to ease some of the deep divisions within its ranks.",
      "From U.S. Catholics to the left of the ideological center, there is optimism that Leo will carry on Pope Francis\u2019 outreach to poor and marginalized people, including migrants, and provide a counterweight to policies of the Trump administration that distress them. To the right, there is hope the new pope will faithfully uphold Catholic doctrine, including opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and women\u2019s ordination.",
      "One reason for optimism: The new pope has made clear \u2014 in his remarks and his choice of a motto \u2014 that unity within the global church will be a paramount priority.",
      "\u201cIn these early days, he\u2019s still an empty vessel,\u201d said Steven Millies, a public theology professor at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. \u201cUntil we all get to know him better, we can pour our expectations into him.\u201d",
      "Notre Dame Provost John McGreevy, a historian of Catholicism, said he was \u201ccompletely stunned\u201d after the papal announcement, having shared the conventional wisdom that a pope from the U.S. was a near-impossibility.",
      "But Leo \u201cis a global Catholic citizen,\u201d McGreevy said, citing the pontiff\u2019s time in Peru, at the Vatican and leading an international religious order.",
      "\u201cEven though he\u2019s an American, and we\u2019re super proud that he\u2019s American, it\u2019s hard to think of someone more embedded in a lot of the global church,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s too soon to tell what Leo\u2019s relationship will be with his fellow American prelates and the broader U.S. Catholic Church, McGreevy cautioned.",
      "\u201cThe early indications are that there\u2019ll be some similarities to Pope Francis,\u201d he said \u2013 suggesting that differences with conservative U.S. bishops could continue.",
      "McGreevy said he expects some tension between the Vatican and the White House over immigration and climate change, two of Francis\u2019 key priorities that are likely to be reaffirmed by Leo.",
      "Chad Pecknold, a professor of systematic theology at the Catholic University of America, suggested that Francis either disliked or misunderstood the United States.",
      "\u201cWith Leo XIV, it\u2019s clear he not only loves America, but he even loves the White Sox,\u201d Pecknold said via email. \u201cThat can only have a good effect, not only upon American Catholics, but also American bishops, and indeed, everyone. It\u2019s good to feel like the pope is on your side.\u201d",
      "During the latter years of Francis\u2019 papacy, one of the most divisive issues among U.S. bishops was whether Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights \u2014 including then-President Joe Biden and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 should be barred from receiving Communion.",
      "Francis stressed he would not reject politicians who support abortion rights and Biden received Communion during a visit to Rome in 2021.",
      "San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, who barred Pelosi from receiving Communion in the archdiocese, described Leo as a \"bridge builder.\"",
      "\"He will be a good force for unity in the church,\u201d Cordileone told KPIX-TV in San Francisco. \u201cEven with differences of opinion and different ideas of strategy and so forth, we can have unity in the church.\u201d",
      "U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican and outspoken abortion opponent, took heart from a homily delivered early this year by Leo when he was Cardinal Robert Prevost. The passage cited by Smith: \u201cGod\u2019s mercy calls us to protect every life, especially those society overlooks \u2014 the child yet to be born and the elderly nearing their journey\u2019s end \u2014 because each bears Christ\u2019s face.\u201d",
      "Smith depicted this remark as \u201cunderscoring the protection of the right to life as first among the many humanitarian responsibilities of the Church.\u201d",
      "The interim president of Catholics for Choice, which supports abortion rights, acknowledged that Leo opposes abortion and said the group would send him letters from Catholics who disagree with that stance.",
      "\u201cWe are praying that he will be a pope guided by a commitment to peace, justice, and inclusion,\u201d said Chris Wimbush. \u201cThe future of our church depends on greater inclusion and nuance on reproductive health decisions like abortion, contraception and IVF.\"",
      "Francis, during his papacy, took major strides to give women more senior leadership positions in the church. But he upheld the ban on female priests and tamped down hopes that women could be ordained as deacons.",
      "Ellie Hidalgo of Discerning Deacons, which advocates for women deacons in the church, said she hopes Leo will support the church\u2019s ongoing review of women\u2019s participation in ministry. A years-long Vatican process left open the contentious question of whether women should be ordained as deacons.",
      "Hidalgo, who lives in Miami, heard then-Cardinal Prevost speak in February when she was in Rome for a celebration of deacons.",
      "\u201cHe was asking deacons to be humble in their service,\u201d Hidalgo said. \"I could tell just from meeting him that that\u2019s something he really values himself ... that you are to be of service and you\u2019re there in a posture of humility.\u201d",
      "The U.S.-based Women\u2019s Ordination Conference, which advocates for women to be accepted as priests, welcomed the inclusive tone of Leo\u2019s initial remarks.",
      "\u201cHis clear emphasis on bridge-building and dialogue offer WOC hope that Pope Leo XIV might be a leader who will also build bridges to Catholic women,\u201d the group\u2019s statement said. It envisioned \u201ca long-overdue day when women are recognized as equals in Christ.\u201d",
      "Francis, in many ways, saw Robert Prevost as a possible successor, assigning him to positions in Peru that bolstered his global resume and later calling him to the Vatican to oversee the influential office that vets bishop nominations.",
      "\u201cFrancis was paying close attention to new U.S bishops,\u201d said Millies, the public theology professor. \u201cPrevost has been Francis\u2019 man overseeing the careful selection of a different sort of bishop to fill important posts in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Millies said the top leadership of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops \u2014 which was sometimes at odds with Francis \u2014 remains relatively conservative.",
      "But in the ranks of bishops below them, \u201cthe change has already happened,\u201d Millies said. \u201cThey are men who are more pastoral than focused on doctrine. The election of Leo means we are firmly in a different era.\u201d",
      "Traditionally, the taboo against a U.S. pope reflected reluctance to give the world's No. 1 superpower even more influence. That shouldn't be a concern with Leo, according to Austen Ivereigh, a British-based journalist and author of two books on the Francis papacy.",
      "\u201cIf anybody thinks he (Leo) is going to take a different line from Francis on migration or climate change, they\u2019re in for a surprise,\" Ivereigh said. \"Francis was putting into practice church teaching, and Leo will do the same.\u201d",
      "There was muted reaction to Leo's election from Bishop Robert Strickland, who was ousted by Francis in 2023 from leadership of the Diocese of Tyler in Texas. Strickland had been a fierce critic of Francis and came to symbolize the polarization within the U.S. hierarchy.",
      "In social media posts after Leo assumed the papacy, Strickland expressed hope that he would faithfully uphold the sacred Scriptures and traditions known as the Deposit of Faith.",
      "\u201cWith the heavy weight of the papacy now on his shoulders he needs our prayers,\u201d Strickland added.",

      "The United States is pulling back from its role in spreading democratic ideals abroad under President Donald Trump",
      "CHICAGO -- Growing up in the former Soviet Union, Pedro Spivakovsky-Gonzalez\u2019s father and grandparents would listen to Voice of America with their ears pressed to the radio, trying to catch words through the government\u2019s radio jamming.",
      "The U.S.-funded news service was instrumental in helping them understand what was happening on the other side of the Iron Curtain, before they moved to the United States in the 1970s.",
      "\u201cIt was a window into another world,\u201d Spivakovsky-Gonzalez said. \u201cThey looked to it as a sort of a beacon of freedom. They were able to imagine a different world from the one they were living in.\u201d",
      "When Spivakovsky-Gonzalez and his family heard of President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media \u2014 the agency that oversees VOA, Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia \u2013- he said it was a \u201cgut punch.\u201d",
      "The first months of the second Trump administration have delivered blow after blow to American efforts to promote democracy abroad and pierce the information wall of authoritarian governments through programs that had been sustained over decades by presidents of both political parties.",
      "The new administration has decimated the Agency for Global Media, restructured the State Department to eliminate a global democracy office and gutted the U.S. Agency for International Development, which just last year launched an initiative to try to halt democratic backsliding across the globe. In all, the moves represent a retrenchment from the U.S. role in spreading democracy beyond its borders.",
      "Experts say the moves will create a vacuum for promoting freedom and representative government, and could accelerate what many see as anti-democratic trends around the world.",
      "\u201cThe United States has historically been the leading power in spreading democracy globally. Despite different administrations, that has remained the case \u2013- until now,\u201d said Staffan Lindberg, a political science professor at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.",
      "David Salvo, managing director for the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, said promoting democracy abroad has been \u201ca pillar of American foreign policy in the last 50 years\u201d as a means of ensuring more stable, peaceful relationships with other countries, reducing the threat of conflict and war, and fostering economic cooperation.",
      "Yet among Trump\u2019s early actions was targeting democracy programs through the State Department and USAID, which had launched a new global democracy initiative at the tail end of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. The Treasury Department halted funding to the National Endowment for Democracy, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in April he would shutter a State Department office that had a mission to build \u201cmore democratic, secure, stable, and just societies.\u201d",
      "Funding cuts have hit the National Democratic Institute, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems and U.S. nonprofits that have worked for decades \u201cto inject resources into environments so that civil society and democratic actors can try to effect change for the better,\u201d including through bolstering unstable democracies against autocrats, Salvo said.",
      "Whether global democracy programs are worth funding was central to a hearing Thursday held by a U.S. House Foreign Affairs subcommittee as Rep. Maria Salazar, R-Fla., repeatedly asked how to \u201censure our return on investment is really high.\u201d",
      "About 1.2% of the federal budget went to foreign aid in the 2023 fiscal year, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\u201cI understand the committee is interested in how we can improve ... and get back to basics,\u201d Tom Malinowski, a former Democratic congressman from New Jersey and assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor under President Barack Obama, told lawmakers. \u201cThe problem is the administration is eliminating the basics right now.\u201d",
      "Uzra Zeya, who leads the international nonprofit Human Rights First after serving in the Biden State Department, said it was \u201cheartbreaking and alarming\" to watch the U.S. essentially dismantle its democracy and human rights programs.",
      "\"The potential long-term impacts are devastating for U.S. national security and prosperity,\" she said.",
      "For more than 80 years, VOA and its related outlets have delivered news across the world, including to more than 427 million people every week in 49 languages, according to a 2024 internal report. The broadcaster began during World War II to provide Germans with news, even as Nazi officials attempted to jam its signals. The Soviet Union and China attempted to silence its broadcasts during the Cold War. Iranian and North Korean governments have also tried to block access to VOA for decades.",
      "But the most successful attempt to silence VOA has been through its own government. It was effectively shut down in March through an executive order.",
      "Lisa Brakel, a 66-year-old retired librarian in Temperance, Michigan, said VOA was a \u201cmainstay\u201d when she was a music teacher in Kuwait in the 1980s. She and her colleagues would listen together in the apartment complex where the American teachers were housed, using it as a way to stay up-to-date with U.S. news.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw the news, I thought, \u2018No, they can\u2019t shut this down. Too many people depend on that,\u2019\u201d Brakel said. \u201cAs a librarian, any cuts to free access to information deeply concern me.\u201d",
      "The broadcaster\u2019s future remains in flux after a federal appellate court paused a ruling that would have reversed its dismantling. This was just a day after journalists were told they would soon return to work after being off the air for almost two months. Even if they are allowed back, it's not clear the mission would be the same. This past week, the Trump administration agreed to use the conservative and heavily pro-Trump media network OAN\u2019s feed on VOA and other services.",
      "In Asia, dismantling Radio Free Asia would mean losing the world\u2019s only independent Uyghur language news service, closing the Asia Fact Check Lab as it reports on misinformation from the Chinese Community Party, and curbing access to information in countries such as China, North Korea and Myanmar that lack free and independent media, the broadcaster\u2019s president, Bay Fang, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cTheir invaluable work is part of RFA\u2019s responsibility to uphold the truth so that dictators and despots don\u2019t have the last word,\u201d Fang wrote in May in The New York Times.",
      "Experts who monitor global democracy said the information gap created by the administration will embolden U.S. competitors such as Russia and China, which already are at work trying to shape public opinion.",
      "Barbara Wejnert, a political sociologist at the University at Buffalo, who studies global democracies, said diplomatic efforts through U.S. broadcasters and democracy nonprofits helped precipitate a \u201crapid increase in democratizing countries\u201d in the late 20th century.",
      "\u201cEspecially today when the truth is distorted and people don\u2019t trust governments, spreading the notion of freedom and democracy through media is even more vital,\u201d she said.",

      "PALMER, Alaska -- It is one of Alaska\u2019s favorite Mother\u2019s Day traditions, getting up close and personal with animals that have survived the ice age.",
      "All moms get a daisy and free admission Sunday at the Musk Ox Farm in Palmer, about an hour\u2019s drive north of Anchorage. Once inside they will have the chance to view 75 members of the musk ox herd, including three young calves just getting their feet under them. Also a draw is an old bull named Trebek, named after the late \u201cJeopardy!\u201d host Alex Trebek, a benefactor of the facility.",
      "\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day with a musk ox mom and the most adorable calf you\u2019re ever going to find in your life?\u201d said Mark Austin, the farm\u2019s executive director.",
      "Mother\u2019s Day is the traditional start of the summer season for the farm, which traces its roots back to 1964 and at several locations before moving in 1986 to Palmer.",
      "That move put it on Alaska\u2019s limited road system, provided easier access to grazing land than in tundra communities and it to incorporate educational opportunities at the farm facility, which is dwarfed by the the Talkeetna and Chugach mountain ranges.",
      "\u201cWhen we opened the doors here, we started doing Mother\u2019s Day as a grand opening every year,\u201d Austin said.",
      "He called it a natural decision, celebrating mothers with cute, newborn baby musk oxen on the grounds. So far this year, three baby musk oxen have been born and are on display, and more could be on the way.",
      "Mother\u2019s Day is the busiest day of the year, attracting more than 1,500 visitors. It is a tradition that now stretches over three generations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge, just kind of rite of passage for a lot of people,\u201d Austin said. \u201cIf we ever talked about not doing it, there\u2019d be a riot.\u201d",
      "Musk oxen are ice age survivors.",
      "\u201cThey were running around with saber-toothed tigers and mastodons, and they\u2019re the ones that lived,\u201d Austin said. The herd members all have diverse personalities, he added, and they are crafty, smart and inquisitive.",
      "Their closest relatives to animals of today would be Arctic goats. Mature musk ox bulls can stand 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) tall and weigh as much as 800 pounds (about 360 kilograms), while female cows are smaller at about 4 feet (about 1.2 meters) and up to 500 pounds (about 230 kilograms), according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's website.",
      "They are stocky, long-haired animals with a slight hump in their shoulder, a short tail and horns, the website says. The Inupiat call musk ox \u201citomingmak,\u201d which means \u201cthe animal with skin like a beard,\u201d for its long hair hanging nearly to the ground.",
      "The mammals once roamed across northern Europe, Asia, Greenland and North America before they began to die off. By the 1920s the last remaining ones were in Greenland and Canada.",
      "Efforts to reintroduce the musk ox to Alaska started in 1934, when 34 were delivered to Fairbanks from Greenland. Since then, the wild population has grown to about 5,000, located throughout the nation's largest state, Austin said.",
      "The nonprofit farm welcomes donations from visitors on Sunday. Some people will make a beeline for the baby musk oxen, while others will throw a $100 bill on the counter first.",
      "\u201cWe do like to see the donation, but we truly offer this as an event to the community, as a thank you,\u201d Austin said. \u201cIt really gives us a chance to give something back.\u201d",

      "Bobby Gumpright was in the throws of addiction 25 years ago when he fabricated a story that he had been robbed at gunpoint by a Black man",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- As 18-year-old Bobby Gumpright rode his bike home from his bartending job in New Orleans in 1999, he began to concoct a story about why he didn't have any money. In the throes of addiction and not wanting to admit he had spent his paycheck on drugs, Gumpright lied to his father and said a Black man had robbed him at gunpoint.",
      "The fabrication spun out of control when a detective, armed with photos of potential suspects, asked Gumpright to point to the culprit.",
      "Across town, Jermaine Hudson, a 20-year-old Black man, was pulled over for a traffic stop and taken into custody. He figured he would soon be released to go home to his pregnant wife and 10-month-old daughter.",
      "Instead, he was charged with a crime he didn't commit.",
      "Even though two jurors didn't believe Gumpright's story, Hudson was found guilty by a split jury, a practice that 20 years later would be deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, which acknowledged its origins from racist Jim Crow laws.",
      "Nearly 1,000 people convicted by split juries remain in prison in Louisiana.",
      "Now, 25 years after Gumpright's lies sent Hudson to prison, the two unlikely friends are sharing their story in a push for legislation to give some of those people a chance to have their cases retired.",
      "As Hudson sat in the courtroom in 2001, he grappled with a reality that he didn't create.",
      "\u201cNever in my wildest dreams would I have thought my life would have been at a standstill ... missing out on my kids\u2019 life, on my life,\" Hudson told The Associated Press last month.",
      "Two witnesses testified: the officer who responded to the 911 call and Gumpright.",
      "As Gumpright took the stand, Hudson prayed the stranger would acknowledge the wrongful allegation and his nightmare would end.",
      "A prosecutor asked Gumpright, who is white, if he was sure it was Hudson who robbed him. He responded, \u201c110%.\u201d",
      "In a 10-2 vote, the jury convicted Hudson of armed robbery. The judge sentenced him to 99 years in prison.",
      "At the time of Hudson's trial, only Louisiana and Oregon allowed convictions if one or two jurors disagreed.",
      "Louisiana adopted the practice in 1898, fueled by efforts to maintain white supremacy after the Civil War. Diluting the voice of Black jurors allowed the often-white majority to determine the outcome.",
      "In 2018, Louisiana voters did away with the use of nonunanimous jury convictions, two years before the Supreme Court ruling.",
      "Of the 1,500 people in Louisiana prisons from split jury convictions at that time, about 80% were Black and most were serving life sentences, according to a Project of Justice Initiative analysis.",
      "Following the high court decision, Oregon's Supreme Court granted new trials to hundreds of people. But Louisiana\u2019s Supreme Court rejected arguments to apply the ruling retroactively, leaving people like Hudson locked up with scarce legal options or waiting on a miracle.",
      "Years of Hudson's life dwindled away as he missed the birth of his second daughter, graduations and other milestones. He prayed Gumpright would \u201ccome forward with the truth.\u201d",

      "In 2021, Hudson was preparing to take a new deal: plead guilty to armed robbery in exchange for a sentence of time served. Just days before the bargain was finalized, Hudson received news he long waited for. Gumpright, who had entered a drug treatment facility, had come clean about his lies.",

      "BOSTON -- A Tufts University student from Turkey returned to Boston on Saturday, one day after being released from a Louisiana immigration detention center where she was held for over six weeks.",
      "Upon arrival at Logan Airport, Rumeysa Ozturk told reporters she was excited to get back to her studies during what has been a \u201cvery difficult\u201d period.",
      "\u201cIn the last 45 days, I lost both my freedom and also my education during a crucial time for my doctoral studies,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am so grateful for all the support, kindness and care.\u201d",
      "A federal judge ordered Ozturk\u2019s release Friday pending a final decision on her claim that she was illegally detained following an op-ed she co-wrote last year criticizing her university\u2019s response to Israel and the war in Gaza.",
      "Ozturk said she will continue her case in the courts, adding, \u201cI have faith in the American system of justice.\u201d",
      "She was joined by her lawyers and two of Massachusetts\u2019 Democratic members of Congress, Sen. Edward Markey and Rep. Ayanna Pressley.",
      "\u201cToday is a tremendous day as we welcome you back, Rumeysa,\u201d Markey said. \u201cYou have made millions and millions of people across our country so proud of the way you have fought.\u201d",
      "Appearing by video for her bail hearing the previous day, Ozturk, 30, detailed her growing asthma attacks in detention and her desire to finish her doctorate focusing on children and social media.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Sessions in Vermont ruled that she was to be released on her own recognizance with no travel restrictions. She was not a danger to the community or a flight risk, he said, while noting that he might amend the release order to consider any conditions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in consultation with her lawyers.",
      "Sessions said the government offered no evidence for why Ozturk was arrested other than the op-ed.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review did not respond to an email message seeking comment Friday afternoon.",
      "Ozturk was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece last year in campus newspaper The Tufts Daily. It criticized the university\u2019s response to student activists demanding that Tufts \u201cacknowledge the Palestinian genocide,\u201d disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.",
      "On March 25 immigration officials surrounded Ozturk in Massachusetts and took her into custody. She was then driven to New Hampshire and Vermont and flown to a detention center in Basile, Louisiana.",
      "Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said.",
      "Ozturk\u2019s lawyers first filed a petition on her behalf in Massachusetts, but they did not know where she was and were unable to speak to her until more than 24 hours after she was detained. A Massachusetts judge later transferred the case to Vermont.",
      "A State Department memo said Ozturk\u2019s visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions \u201c\u2018may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization\u2019 including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.\u201d",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in March, without providing evidence, that investigations found that Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist group.",
      "This week a federal appeals court upheld Sessions' order to bring Ozturk back to New England for hearings to determine whether her constitutional rights, including free speech and due process, were violated, as her lawyers argue.",
      "Immigration proceedings for Ozturk, initiated in Louisiana, are being conducted separately in that state and Ozturk can participate remotely, the court said.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- More than 100 people have been taken into custody by federal immigration officials in a joint operation with the Tennessee Highway Patrol, leaving many in Nashville's immigrant community uncertain and worried.",
      "\u201cNone of us have ever seen anything like this,\u201d Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition said Friday.",
      "The operation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a reminder of how local and state law enforcement jurisdictions are critical to President Donald Trump\u2019s plans for mass deportations. Last week, Florida officials touted a joint operation with ICE that resulted in 1,120 immigration arrests.",
      "Tennessee's Gov. Bill Lee recently signed a law creating a division of immigration enforcement with the state\u2019s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which includes the Highway Patrol. He is one of a number of Republican officials pledging to use state resources to carry out Trump\u2019s plans.",
      "Meanwhile, city officials in the Democratic stronghold of Nashville have disavowed involvement and been critical of the arrests. Nashville Law Director Wally Dietz said the state-federal operation, which began May 3, caught everyone in city government by surprise.",
      "Responding to concerns about Nashville police presence outside an ICE office, Dietz said Wednesday that the city \"routinely receives requests for extra patrols for a variety of reasons and responds to the extent resources are available.\" He said he didn't know who was detained and that, when he requested more information from the Highway Patrol, he was told to file a public records request.",
      "The Highway Patrol said Friday that it made 588 stops in the joint operation with ICE, which took custody of 103 under investigation for immigration violations.",
      "The stops \u201cled to the recovery of illegal drugs and firearms \u2014 taking dangerous elements off the street and making Tennessee safer,\u201d the Highway Patrol said. One person was wanted in a killing in El Salvador.",
      "The Highway Patrol said stops are based solely on driver behavior. \"We do not enter neighborhoods or stop vehicles based on who someone is \u2014 we stop based on what they do behind the wheel,\" it said.",
      "But immigrant rights supporters contend that the patrols have focused on parts of the city where the majority of residents are people of color.",
      "\u201cAll signs point to this being racial profiling intended to terrorize the heart of the immigrant and refugee community,\u201d Sherman Luna said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve heard is that THP is flagging people down for things like a broken taillight or tinted windows.\"",
      "Sherman Luna believes some of those being detained would be allowed to stay in the country if they were able to receive competent legal representation at an immigration hearing. Instead, she has heard that people are agreeing to be deported out of fear that they could spend months or years in immigration detention.",
      "About 9% of the Nashville metropolitan area population of about 2 million are immigrants, with many from Mexico and Honduras, according to the Migration Policy Institute's analysis of census data. The city also has a large Kurdish population living alongside refugees from Sudan, Myanmar and other countries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a strategy to strike fear into our vibrant, diverse, beautiful neighborhoods,\" Sherman Luna said.",

      "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was released after spending several hours in custody following his arrest at a new federal immigration detention center he has been protesting against.",
      "Baraka was accused of trespassing and ignoring warnings to leave the Delaney Hall facility and was finally released around 8 p.m. Friday. Stepping out of an SUV with flashing emergency lights, he told waiting supporters: \u201cThe reality is this: I didn't do anything wrong.\u201d",
      "The mayor said he could not speak about his case, citing a promise he made to lawyers and the judge. But he voiced full-throated support for everyone living in his community, immigrants included.",
      "\u201cAll of us here, every last one of us, I don\u2019t care what background you come from, what nationality, what language you speak,\u201d Baraka said, \u201cat some point we have to stop these people from causing division between us.\u201d",
      "Baraka, a Democrat who is running to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, has embraced the fight with the Trump administration over illegal immigration.",
      "He has aggressively pushed back against the construction and opening of the 1,000-bed detention center, arguing that it should not be allowed to open because of building permit issues.",

      "Alina Habba, interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said on the social platform X that Baraka trespassed at the detention facility, which is run by private prison operator Geo Group.",
      "Habba said Baraka had \u201cchosen to disregard the law.\u201d",
      "Video of the incident showed that Baraka was arrested after returning to the public side of the gate to the facility.",
      "Witnesses said the arrest came after Baraka attempted to join three members of New Jersey\u2019s congressional delegation, Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman, in attempting to enter the facility.",
      "When federal officials blocked his entry, a heated argument broke out, according to Viri Martinez, an activist with the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. It continued even after Baraka returned to the public side of the gates.",
      "\u201cThere was yelling and pushing,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThen the officers swarmed Baraka. They threw one of the organizers to the ground. They put Baraka in handcuffs and put him in an unmarked car.\u201d",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the lawmakers had not asked for a tour of Delaney Hall, which the agency said it would have facilitated. The department said that as a bus carrying detainees was entering in the afternoon \u201ca group of protestors, including two members of the U.S. House of Representatives, stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility.\u201d",
      "Watson Coleman spokesperson Ned Cooper said the three lawmakers went there unannounced because they planned to inspect it, not take a scheduled tour.",
      "\u201cThey arrived, explained to the guards and the officials at the facility that they were there to exercise their oversight authority,\u201d he said, adding that they were allowed to enter and inspect the center sometime between 3 and 4 p.m.",
      "Watson Coleman later said the DHS statement inaccurately characterized the visit.",
      "\u201cContrary to a press statement put out by DHS we did not \u2018storm\u2019 the detention center,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe author of that press release was so unfamiliar with the facts on the ground that they didn\u2019t even correctly count the number of Representatives present. We were exercising our legal oversight function as we have done at the Elizabeth Detention Center without incident.\u201d",
      "In video of the altercation shared with The Associated Press, a federal official in a jacket with the logo of the Homeland Security Investigations can be heard telling Baraka he could not enter the facility because \u201cyou are not a congress member.\u201d",
      "Baraka then left the secure area, rejoining protesters on the public side of the gate. Video showed him speaking through the gate to a man in a suit, who said: \u201cThey\u2019re talking about coming back to arrest you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on their property. They can\u2019t come out on the street and arrest me,\u201d Baraka replied.",
      "Minutes later several ICE agents, some wearing face coverings, surrounded him and others on the public side. As protesters cried out, \u201cShame,\u201d Baraka was dragged back through the gate in handcuffs.",
      "Several civil rights and immigration reform advocates, as well as government officials, condemned Baraka\u2019s arrest. New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, whose office is defending a state law barring private immigration detention facilities, criticized the arrest during a seemingly peaceful protest and said no state or local law enforcement agencies were involved.",

      "The announcement was part of President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to sharply increase detention beds nationwide from a budget of about 41,000 beds this year.",

      "GENEVA -- The U.S. Treasury Secretary and America\u2019s top trade negotiator began talks with high-ranking Chinese officials in Switzerland Saturday aiming to de-escalate a dispute that threatens to cut off trade between the world\u2019s two biggest economies and damage the global economy.",
      "China's Xinhua News Agency says Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer have begun meetings in Geneva with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng.",
      "Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks have begun but spoke anonymously and the exact location of the talks wasn't made public. However, a motorcade of black cars and vans was seen leaving the home of the Swiss Ambassador to the United Nations in the wealthy Swiss city, and a diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the meeting, said the sides met for about two hours before departing for a previously arranged luncheon.",
      "Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they\u2019ve slapped on each other\u2019s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries\u2019 boycotting each other\u2019s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Even before the talks began, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \u201c 80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\u201cThe best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\u201d she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \u201cIt cannot just be words.\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example, imposed a 10% tax on imports from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump\u2019s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.",
      "During Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2014 such as China\u2019s subsidies \u2014 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn\u2019t come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China's tech policy now resumes.",
      "Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland, Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Trump last month suspended plans to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\u201cAn increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland\u2019s interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\u201d the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \u201cis therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\u201d",
      "The government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another 21% beginning Wednesday.",
      "The United States is Switzerland\u2019s second-biggest trading partner after the EU \u2013 a 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",

      "A man who was found dead along Interstate 5 in Oregon has been identified after nearly 45 years and police say a notorious California serial killer is the sole person of interest in the case.",
      "The 30-year-old was identified Friday as Larry Eugene Parks. Oregon State Police spokesperson Kyle Kennedy said Randy Kraft, who has been dubbed the \u201cScorecard Killer,\u201d is the only person under investigation for the 1980 killing.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some evidence that we\u2019re processing to determine that link,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe are very confident that we have the correct person of interest.\u201d",
      "Kraft, now 80, was convicted in 1989 of brutalizing and killing 16 men over a decade in California and sentenced to death. He remains incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison and has denied killing anyone.",
      "On July 18, 1980, police responded to a report of a body now identified as Parks along I-5 south of Portland near Woodburn. Police opened a homicide investigation at the time and unsuccessfully tried to identify the victim.",
      "Parks, a Vietnam veteran whose family had lost contact with him in 1979, had last been seen in Pensacola, Florida, police said.",
      "Kraft was pulled over in his vehicle on a California freeway in 1983 after a trooper spotted him driving erratically. In the passenger seat of the vehicle was a strangled U.S. Marine. In the trunk of Kraft\u2019s vehicle was a coded list believed to tally 67 victims in California, Oregon and Michigan, according to police.",
      "Prosecutors described Kraft, a former computer programmer, as a fetishist who kept some of the dismembered parts of his victims in his freezer.",
      "In 2024, an Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department investigator reached out to the Oregon State Police Cold Case Unit and offered to help identify the remains using forensic investigative genetic genealogy. A genetic profile was developed from a blood sample and Parks' identity was confirmed after possible family members submitted DNA profiles for comparison, according to police.",
      "Until his identification last month, the circumstances of his disappearance were unknown to the his family, police said.",
      "In 2023, the remains of a teenager believed to have been killed by Kraft in California were also identified using investigative genetic genealogy.",

    "story": [
      "A California judge has ordered the Trump administration to halt much of its massive downsizing of the federal workforce",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The Trump administration must halt much of its dramatic downsizing of the federal workforce, a California judge ordered Friday.",
      "Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco issued the emergency order in a lawsuit filed last week by labor unions and cities, one of multiple legal challenges to Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to shrink the size of a federal government he calls bloated and expensive.",
      "\u201cThe Court holds the President likely must request Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks, and thus issues a temporary restraining order to pause large-scale reductions in force in the meantime,\u201d Illston wrote in her order.",
      "The temporary restraining order directs numerous federal agencies to halt acting on the president\u2019s workforce executive order signed in February and a subsequent memo issued by the Department of Government Efficiency and the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The order, which expires in 14 days, does not require departments to rehire people. Plaintiffs asked that the effective date of any agency action be postponed and that departments stop implementing or enforcing the executive order, including taking any further action.",
      "They limited their request to departments where dismantlement is already underway or poised to be underway, including at the the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which announced in March it will lay off 10,000 workers and centralize divisions.",
      "Illston, who was nominated to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, said at a hearing Friday the president has authority to seek changes in the executive branch departments and agencies created by Congress.",
      "\u201cBut he must do so in lawful ways,\u201d she said. \u201cHe must do so with the cooperation of Congress, the Constitution is structured that way.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly said voters gave him a mandate to remake the federal government, and he tapped billionaire Elon Musk to lead the charge through DOGE.",
      "Tens of thousands of federal workers have been fired, left their jobs via deferred resignation programs or have been placed on leave as a result of Trump\u2019s government-shrinking efforts. There is no official figure for the job cuts, but at least 75,000 federal employees took deferred resignation, and thousands of probationary workers have already been let go.",
      "In her order, Illston gave several examples to show the impact of the downsizing. One union that represents federal workers who research health hazards faced by mineworkers said it was poised to lose 221 of 222 workers in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, office; a Vermont farmer didn\u2019t receive a timely inspection on his property to receive disaster aid after flooding and missed an important planting window; a reduction in Social Security Administration workers has led to longer wait times for recipients.",
      "All the agencies impacted were created by Congress, she noted.",
      "Lawyers for the government argued Friday that the executive order and memo calling for large-scale personnel reductions and reorganization plans provided only general principles that agencies should follow in exercising their own decision-making process.",
      "\u201cIt expressly invites comments and proposals for legislative engagement as part of policies that those agencies wish to implement,\u201d Eric Hamilton, a deputy assistant attorney general, said of the memo. \u201cIt is setting out guidance.\u201d",
      "But Danielle Leonard, an attorney for plaintiffs, said it was clear that the president, DOGE and OPM were making decisions outside of their authority and not inviting dialogue from agencies.",
      "\u201cThey are not waiting for these planning documents\" to go through long processes, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not asking for approval, and they\u2019re not waiting for it.\u201d",
      "The temporary restraining order applies to departments including the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Labor, Interior, State, Treasury and Veterans Affairs.",
      "It also applies to the National Science Foundation, Small Business Association, Social Security Administration and Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Some of the labor unions and nonprofit groups are also plaintiffs in another lawsuit before a San Francisco judge challenging the mass firings of probationary workers. In that case, Judge William Alsup ordered the government in March to reinstate those workers, but the U.S. Supreme Court later blocked his order.",
      "Plaintiffs include the cities of San Francisco, Chicago and Baltimore; labor group American Federation of Government Employees; and nonprofit groups Alliance for Retired Americans, Center for Taxpayer Rights and Coalition to Protect America\u2019s National Parks.",

      "NEW YORK -- Columbia University has suspended dozens of students and barred alums and others who participated in a pro-Palestinian demonstration inside the school\u2019s main library earlier this week, a school spokesperson said Friday.",
      "The Ivy League institution in Manhattan placed more than 65 students on interim suspension and barred 33 others, including those from affiliated institutions such as Barnard College, from setting foot on campus.",
      "Interim suspension generally means that a student cannot come to campus, attend classes or participate in other university activities, according to Columbia's website. The university declined to say how long the disciplinary measures would be in place, saying only that the decisions are pending further investigation.",
      "An undisclosed number of alums who also participated in the protest are also now prevented from entering school grounds, according to Columbia.",
      "Roughly 80 people were arrested in connection with the Wednesday evening demonstration at the university's Butler Library. Most face trespassing charges, though some may also face disorderly conduct, police have said.",
      "The mask-clad protesters pushed their way past campus security officers, raced into the building and hung Palestinian flags and other banners on bookshelves. Some protesters also scrawled phrases on library furniture and picture frames, including \u201cColumbia will burn.\"",
      "New York City police in helmets and other protection broke up the demonstration at the request of university officials, who denounced the protests as an \u201coutrageous\u201d disruption for students studying and preparing for final exams.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said his office will be reviewing the visa status of those who participated in the library takeover for possible deportation.",

      "A man convicted of killing a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper in 1978 has been granted parole after having past requests rejected",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- A man convicted of killing a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper in 1978 has been granted parole after having past requests rejected, inspiring criticism and prompting the governor on Friday to call for reconsidering the decision.",
      "Jimmie K. Nelms and another man, both from Tulsa, Oklahoma, were sentenced to serve two life sentences for the aggravated kidnapping and murder of Trooper Conroy O'Brien following a traffic stop on the Kansas Turnpike about 55 miles (89 kilometers) northeast of Wichita. Nelms' codefendant, Walter Myrick, died in prison in 2009.",
      "In Kansas, killing a law enforcement officer now can be punished by death, with the only other possible sentence in a capital case being life in prison without parole. But in 1978, Kansas had no death penalty, and Nelms was eligible for parole after 30 years in 2008. He sought parole in 2011 and 2021.",
      "A date for Nelms' release hasn't been set. His release was approved by the Prisoner Review Board, comprised of three veteran state Department of Corrections employees appointed by its top administrator. Department spokesman David Thompson said the decision came several weeks after a March 6 hearing.",
      "\u201cThe Kansas Prisoner Review Board believes that Mr. Nelms is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen and is of the opinion that there is reasonable probability that Mr. Nelms can be released without detriment to the community or to himself,\u201d Thompson said in a statement.",
      "The decision didn't become public until the Kansas State Troopers Association condemned it as \u201cdisgraceful and disgusting\u201d in a statement Thursday. Under Kansas law, it appears unlikely that critics can prevent Nelms' release.",
      "\u201cThose who murder law enforcement officers should expect to receive the death penalty, not to be walking free on the streets of KS,\u201d state Attorney General Kris Kobach said in a post on the social platform X.",
      "The Kansas Legislature's top leaders, Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, called the parole decision \u201cunconscionable\u201d Friday.",
      "They and Kobach are Republicans; the Department of Corrections is under Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat. But Kelly wants the board to consider reversing the decision \u201cif legally possible,\" spokesperson Grace Hoge said.",
      "\u201cThe facts of this case demonstrate a brutal and intentional killing of a law enforcement officer,\u201d Hoge said in an email. \u201cThere is no justification for this decision.\u201d",
      "According to court records and news reports, O'Brien stopped Nelms' car for speeding about 2 miles south of a turnpike service area. Myrick was driving.",
      "As O'Brien wrote a ticket in his patrol car, Nelms approached the driver's side with a gun, according to authorities. Nelms forced O'Brien to get out of the car and told him to lie down in a ditch. Authorities said Nelms took O'Brien's gun, struck the trooper with it, and, when O'Brien fell to the ground, shot him twice in the head.",
      "O'Brien was 26 with a pregnant wife. Nelms was 31 and Myrick, 25. A 21-year-old man was also in the car with Nelms and Myrick, but he pleaded guilty to lesser charges and provided crucial testimony against Nelms.",
      "The men fled in Nelms' car, left the turnpike, and eventually drove north, where another patrol trooper spotted the car about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of where O'Brien died. Nelms' car and the trooper's collided in a pasture, and a gun battle ensued.",
      "Nelms denied he was the shooter, but jurors convicted him and Myrick of murder, aggravated kidnapping and other charges during a joint trial.",
      "Nelms served most of his sentence in maximum-security prisons but was transferred to a lower-security facility in 2023. Online Department of Corrections records show four disciplinary reports against him from 1996 to 2017, the last for disobeying orders. Thompson said Nelms works in the prison laundry.",
      "When Nelms sought parole in 2011, decisions were made by a three-member parole board appointed by the governor, subject to state Senate confirmation. That same year, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback issued an executive order abolishing the parole board in favor of a panel of Department of Corrections employees.",
      "Brownback said the move would save the state $500,000 a year, and sentencing laws after 1993 limited parole. Critics worried that the department's board would release inmates just to avoid prison overcrowding, and Kelly, then a state senator, called the change \u201ca really bad idea.\u201d",
      "Masterson, the current Senate president, backed the change in 2011 but said Friday that it \u201chas not functioned as intended\" and that he would work for changes to see that the review board members \u201crightly answer to the people of Kansas.\u201d",
      "Democratic state Rep. Tom Sawyer, who reviewed Nelms' case as a parole board member from 2009 through June 2011, said the board sometimes rejected parole when corrections officials recommended. Now, he said, the process is \u201call in-house.\u201d",
      "As for Nelms, Sawyer said, \u201cI think it\u2019s highly unlikely the parole board would have let him go, based on my experience.\u201d",

      "Favre is among more than three dozen people sued by the state in an attempt to recover misspent welfare dollars through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. More than $1 million in TANF funds were funneled through a nonprofit and used to help pay for a $5 million volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi, Favre's alma mater. Favre's daughter played volleyball at the university starting in 2017.",
      "Favre has repaid $1.1 million, but White is suing the Pro Football Hall of Fame member, saying Favre still owes about $730,000 because interest caused growth in the original amount he owed.",

      "The family of a pilot who died when his helicopter crashed while fighting a Southern California wildfire in 2020 has reached a $15 million settlement with the company that maintained the aircraft",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The family of a helicopter pilot who died when his helicopter crashed in 2020 while fighting a wildfire in Southern California reached a $15 million settlement with the company that maintained the aircraft, their attorneys said Friday.",
      "Michael Fournier was making water drops on Aug. 19, 2020 over hilly, rugged terrain when his bright red Bell UH-1H copter suddenly plunged into a hillside as he was helping battle the Hills Fire burning 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of the small Central Valley town of Coalinga.",
      "Fournier worked for a private Southern California company that contracts with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, and other agencies to provide firefighting aircraft and other services.",
      "\u201cThe Fournier family\u2019s lawsuit sought answers and accountability, and this result does just that,\u201d said Andrew Robb, one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit. Robb said the family would not be making any public comments.",
      "An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s concluded that the helicopter crashed because of \u201ca hydraulic system failure.\u201d",
      "Moments before the crash Fournier radioed to air traffic control that he was having trouble with the helicopter\u2019s hydraulics, Robb said.",
      "Fournier was working with Guardian Helicopters, which is based in Fillmore, California and at the time had a contract with Cal Fire to provide emergency services. The settlement was paid by Rotorcraft Support, Inc., the company that maintained the helicopter. A phone message left with the helicopter maintenance company was not immediately returned Friday.",
      "Fournier\u2019s copter went down in a remote, hilly, smoke-filled area that took a Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s Department search and rescue team nearly four hours to reach.",
      "Fourteen team members in five Jeeps traveled for miles through soft dirt under smoke-filled skies, finally abandoning the vehicles to walk the last several hundred yards to the crash site. There, they carefully wrapped the body in an American flag and carried it to one of the vehicles.",

      "Toy dolls have become the latest rhetorical poster child for President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade has taken aim at a number of foreign goods, from European wines and car parts from Mexico to films made abroad. Lately, the president's wandering ire has found another rhetorical poster child: toy dolls.",
      "Trump asserted that children will be fine having two dolls \u2014 perhaps three or five \u2014 instead of 30 if U.S. import taxes increase consumer prices. The response on social media included memes of him portrayed as the Grinch and photos of a young Barron Trump\u2019s child-sized Mercedes convertible.",
      "\u201cCOMPLETELY out of touch,\" The Loyal Subjects CEO Jonathan Cathey, whose collectible toy company in Los Angeles produces Strawberry Shortcake and Rainbow Brite dolls, wrote on Linkedin. \"If that ain\u2019t a \u2018Let them eat cake\u2019 moment shot through the echoes of history? Love how toys and dolls have become THE martyr metaphor for this nonsensical trade war incoherence.\u201d",
      "The president's comments also touched a nerve with parents, both ones who took offense at the casual way he hypothesized that perhaps \u201ctwo dolls will cost a couple bucks more\u201d and those who acknowledged their own kids have more toys than they need.",
      "Either way, the U.S. toy industry has a lot riding on a possible deescalation of the tariff standoff between the Trump administration and the government in Beijing. Nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. come from China.",
      "The Toy Association, a trade group, has lobbied for an immediate reprieve from the 145% tariff rate the president put on Chinese-made products. Some toy companies warn the likelihood of holiday shortages increases each week the tariff remains in effect.",
      "Here's a snapshot of the doll debate and how tariffs are impacting toys:",
      "From Barbie, Bratz and Cabbage Patch Kids to Adora baby dolls, American Girl and Our Generation, dolls are a big business in the U.S. as well as beloved playthings.",
      "The doll category, which includes accessories like clothes, generated U.S. sales of $2.7 billion last year compared to $2.9 billion in 2023 and $3.4 billion in 2019, according to market research firm Circana.",
      "Consumers splurged on toys during the height of the COVID pandemic to keep children and themselves occupied, but sales flattened as inflation seized the economy.",
      "Younger girls becoming more interested in buying makeup and skincare also has cooled the demand for dolls, Marshal Cohen, Circana's chief retail advisor, said.",
      "The nation's largest toy maker, Mattel, said this week it would have to raise prices for some products sold in the U.S. to offset higher costs related to tariffs.",
      "The company, whose brands include Barbie and American Girl, said the increases were necessary even though it\u2019s speeding up the expansion of its manufacturing base outside of China.",
      "Smaller toy companies are expected to have a harder time than Mattel and Hasbro, which makes the eating, drinking and diaper-wetting Baby Alive. Cathey said he paused The Loyal Subjects' shipments from China in April because he couldn't pay the stratospheric tariff they would have incurred.",
      "\u201cNobody insulates themselves with that much cash,\u201d he said.",
      "With about four months' worth of inventory on hand, Cathey said his ability to secure holiday stock depends on a break in the U.S.-China trade standoff happening in the next two weeks since it would take time for cargo operations to resume.",
      "Cepia, a Missouri company that was behind the 2009 holiday season hit Zhu Zhu Pets, launched a line of 11-inch fashion dolls called Decora Girlz last year. CEO James Russell Hornsby said he was working to relocate some production but the move won't happen in time to replace the orders he planned to get from China.",
      "Hornsby described himself as a Trump supporter and said he understands the administration's desire to reduce trade imbalances.",
      "\u201cLet's just get the deals done and stop all this because (Trump's) disrupting Christmas,\u201d he said.",
      "Although American Girl launched in 1986 with a line based on fictional historical characters, the dolls never were domestic products. They were made in Germany before production eventually moved to China.",
      "Toy experts say that in addition to lower costs, Chinese factories have developed techniques and expertise that are not easily replicated.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any capacity in the U.S. to make rooted doll hair. And then you\u2019ve got things like the faces. Some of them are hand-painted, others are done with a Tampo (printing) machine,\u201d James Zahn, editor-in-chief of industry publication The Toy Book, said of doll-making.",
      "Hornsby said rooting the synthetic hair onto the heads of Decora Girlz dolls is carried out by skilled workers at factories in Guangzhou and Dongguan, China.",
      "\u201cIt's not just sticking into a machine and it automatically does it,\" he said. \u201dYou have to know what you\u2019re doing in order to make that doll look like it\u2019s got a full set of hair when literally maybe only 60% of the head is filled with hair.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said last week that he assumes consumers would prefer to pay more for American-made products. Dolls made in China might have lead paint in them, he said.",
      "Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said the picture is more complicated.",
      "Products for children ages 12 and under require third-party testing and certification from labs approved by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing lead levels in toys, Murray said.",
      "The rules apply to all products sold in the U.S. Toys by major brands such as Fisher-Price, Mattel, Hasbro and Lego, which have long outsourced manufacturing to China, are usually in compliance, she said.",
      "But the rise of online shopping, including e-commerce platforms that ship directly to U.S. consumers from overseas, has posed a challenge, according to Murray. When valued at less than $800, such parcels entered the U.S. duty-free and were not subject to the same scrutiny as bulk imports, she said.",
      "The White House eliminated the customs exemption starting May 2 for low-value parcels that originated in mainland China and Hong Kong. U.S Customs and Border Protection expects additional oversight will make it easier to flag problems.",
      "Toy companies and industry experts argue the high tariffs on Chinese imports will tempt price-sensitive shoppers to search for cheap counterfeit toys that carry higher safety risks.",
      "Plenty of people agree American consumer culture has gotten out of hand, in large part due to prices kept low through the labor of foreign factory workers who earn much less than they would in the U.S.",
      "Katie Walley-Wiegert, 38, a senior marketer in Richmond, Virginia, and the parent of a 2-year-old son, agrees there\u2019s too much materialism but thinks parents should have choices when deciding what is best for their children. She found the wealthy Trump\u2019s comments off-putting.",
      "\u201cI think it is a small view of what purchase habits and realities are for people who buy toys for kids,\u201d Walley-Wiegert said.",
      "San Francisco resident Elenor Mak, who founded the Jilly Bing doll company after she couldn't find an Asian American doll for her daughter, Jillian, now 5, said the president's remarks upset her because some families struggle to buy even one doll.",
      "The trade war with China \u201cjust makes it even more impossible for those families,\u201d Mak said.",

      "Leading aid organizations are triaging aid after countries led by the U.S. funnel less money to foreign assistance",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the world's humanitarian organizations are triaging their shrinking amount of funding, the head of the International Rescue Committee stresses that the choice is stark: Keeping millions alive in the most vulnerable countries will require pulling some assistance for programs in better-off countries that target everything from climate change to refugee resettlement.",
      "Life-saving food, water and health programs already are shutting down in countries including Sudan, where the closing of 80% of communal kitchens has ended the only access to food for millions. That comes after the Trump administration dissolved the lead U.S. aid agency and terminated thousands of foreign assistance programs.",
      "\u201cThere are lives on the line,\u201d David Miliband, president of the IRC, told The Associated Press in an interview this week in Washington, where he also was speaking to lawmakers and Trump administration officials.",
      "\u201cOur point is there's no way you can keep the aid system as it was,\u201d said Miliband, a former U.K. foreign secretary. As it was, he notes, only 14% of total aid was going to humanitarian efforts, while middle-income countries got more funding than low-income ones.",
      "The triage underway shows the impact of the Trump administration decision to pull the U.S. back from being the world\u2019s single largest aid donor. The United States previously provided about a third of the more than $200 billion in foreign assistance given annually by governments worldwide. The White House last week proposed a budget for next year with an 84% cut to such funding.",
      "Other important European donors, including Britain, say they also are cutting aid as they work to free up more money for defense spending, fearing U.S. changes in European defense commitments.",
      "Miliband and his International Rescue Committee are more explicit than some aid groups in offering their ideas for change in leaner funding times. Countries that are doing OK or are downright wealthy should have some of their donor funding redirected, so it can go to the range of needs of poor countries most affected by war and climate change.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a guideline, I would say at least half the global aid budget needs to go to conflict states,\u201d Miliband said. That\u2019s up from about a quarter of total aid now.",
      "Miliband points to climate mitigation in wealthier countries and help for newly arrived refugees to settle in wealthier countries as programs that should be lower priorities for donors in the current harsh aid environment.",
      "With the dust settling from the Trump cuts, aid organizations are looking at how to reorganize to focus on the most vital and strategic aid, said Kate Phillips-Barrasso, a vice president of Mercy Corps, another top humanitarian organization.",
      "\u201cMy fear is that we're going to end up in a world\u201d where donors split their efforts between two poles: arranging financing for infrastructure and economic development in middle-income countries or paying for only the most basic aid \u201chelping people not die\u201d in poor countries, Phillips-Barrasso said.",
      "\u201cI worry about pretty much everything in the middle disappearing,\u201d she said. That would leave the very poorest and most fragile countries never getting the help they need to get ahead of climate change and other threats.",
      "For Miliband and the IRC, donors should focus on getting humanitarian aid, climate help and other vital assistance to 13 poor countries struggling the most with conflicts and environmental damage. That includes Afghanistan, where the Trump administration has cut aid on the grounds that it could benefit the Taliban, and Yemen, where the U.S. recently reached a ceasefire with Houthi militants, who have been targeting global shipping.",
      "The other countries that the IRC identifies as priorities for the shrinking pool of aid funding are Haiti, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad, Mali, Mozambique, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s cuts already have forced top aid organizations to pull out of entire countries. Groups say that endangers the progress many countries in Africa and elsewhere have made and threatens further destabilization and extremist gains in volatile regions, including the southern edge of the Sahara.",

      "The choice of Steiner has been seen by the postal unions as a harbinger for possible privatization of some or all of the venerable quasi-public institution, which is largely self-funded and has a mission to serve every address in the country \u2014 nearly 167 million residences, businesses and post office boxes.",

Steiner\u2019s selection is an open invitation to do just that.\u201d",

While postal officials contend it has led to major efficiency improvements, some members of Congress have criticized it for leading to mail delays, unsustainable postage increases and declines in business.",

    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, \"freaked out\".",
      "US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (\u00a3601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures.",
      "It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit.",
      "Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu.",
      "But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling.",
      "US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages.",
      "With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner.",
      "\"I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,\" she says.",
      "Use of rules known as \"de minimis\", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade.",
      "Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods.",
      "By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day.",
      "Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers.",
      "Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country.",
      "Trump recently called de minimis a \"scam\", brushing off concerns about higher costs. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said.",
      "However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home.",
      "Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple.",
      "Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled.",
      "\"I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly.\"",
      "When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the US.",
      "'End of an era'",
      "Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households.",
      "\"It does kind of feel like the end of an era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers.",
      "She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a \"money grab\" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up.",
      "\"I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer.",
      "\"It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves.\"",
      "As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift.",
      "The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border.",
      "Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant \"on paper\", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation.",
      "She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements.",
      "\"Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,\" she says.",
      "'An insurmountable shift'",
      "Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before.",
      "Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously.",
      "Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices.",
      "Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive.",
      "\"If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,\" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing.",
      "\"But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift.\"",
      "In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, warned that ending de minimis posed a \"significant threat to the viability\" of its business and other mid-size American firms like it.",
      "Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US.",
      "His firm has been pushing to reduce its reliance on China, halting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price increases and job cuts.",
      "He says his business has room to manoeuvre, since it caters to higher income customers, but he expects \"thousands\" of other brands to die without changes to the situation.",
      "\"We want more time,\" he says. \"The speed at which everything is happening is too fast for businesses to adjust.\""

      "And the commerce ministry framed it as a favour to Washington, saying it was answering the \"calls of US businesses and consumers\".",

      "\"They said we initiated? Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files,\" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.",

      "The timing is also key for Beijing because it's during Xi's visit to Moscow. He was a guest of honour on Friday at Moscow's Victory Day parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World War Two victory over Nazi Germany.",
      "Xi stood alongside leaders from across the Global South - a reminder to Trump's administration that China not only has other options for trade, but it is also presenting itself as an alternative global leader.",
      "This allows Beijing to project strength even as it heads to the negotiating table.",
      "The pressure is on",
      "Trump insists that the tariffs will make America stronger, and Beijing has vowed to \"fight till the end\"- but the fact is the levies are hurting both countries.",
      "Factory output in China has taken a hit, according to government data. Manufacturing activity in April dipped to the lowest level since December 2023. And a survey by news outlet Caixin this week showed that services activity has reached a seven-month low.",
      "The BBC found that Chinese exporters have been reeling from the steep tariffs, with stock piling up in warehouses, even as they strike a defiant note and look for markets beyond the US.",
      "\"I think [China] realises that a deal is better than no deal,\" says Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute in National University Singapore.",

      "And so with the major May Day holiday in China over, officials in Beijing have decided the time is right to talk.",
      "On the other side, the uncertainty caused by tariffs led to the US economy contracting for the first time in three years.",

      "Trump himself has acknowledged that US consumers will feel the sting.",
      "American children may \"have two dolls instead of 30 dolls\", he said at a cabinet meeting this month, \"and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally\".",
      "Trump's approval ratings have also slid over fears of inflation and a possible recession, with more than 60% of Americans saying he was focusing too much on tariffs.",
      "\"Both countries are feeling pressure to provide a bit of reassurance to increasingly nervous markets, businesses, and domestic constituencies,\" Mr Olson says.",

      "The plant now operates 24 hours a day and new supply chains, that source more of the explosives and propellants domestically, mean that the plant, along with its sister facility in South Wales, can increase production 16-fold over the next five years,  according to BAE munitions chief Steve Cardew.",

      "As part of the tariff deal the UK has agreed to allow up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef imports from the US tariff-free. That is the equivalent of one medium-sized steak per adult per year. Currently the US exports around 1,000 tonnes to the UK with a 20% tariff, the UK's Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) said.",

      "The ONS's flagship jobs survey has struggled to gather enough responses, as fewer and fewer people completed its questionnaires.",

      "Criticisms",

      "ONS statisticians went on strike over the reversal of one of the most generous work-from-home policies in the civil service.",
      "The Office for Statistics Regulation - the regulator - criticised the ONS for its \"defensiveness\" when responding to questions about a new analysis of gender identity.",
      "And repeated upward revisions undermined the credibility of the ONS's estimates of the levels of migration.",
      "In April, the Cabinet Office announced a rapid review, to be overseen by Sir Robert Devereux, a retired senior British civil servant.",
      "The review will look into the ONS's delivery of core statistics and major programmes, its organisational culture, structure and leadership and its relationships with the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury."

      "Zara is owned by Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer, which runs a string of store chains including Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear.",
      "It relies on 1,800 suppliers across the world, but nearly all the clothes are brought to Spain where the company is based, to be despatched to stores in 97 countries.",
      "Zara doesn't advertise and rarely gives interviews. But as it marks 50 years since the opening of its first store, I've come to its vast campus in Galicia to meet the boss and workers for a rare glimpse into how the secretive brand operates.",
      "It's a time when the company finds itself having to navigate fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, who ship their goods direct from China, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs.",

      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments following the latest cut, said the banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though,\" she said.",
      "Interest rates are the Bank's main tool in try to maintain the annual rate of inflation at, or close to, its target of 2%.",
      "The most recent UK inflation figures show prices rose 2.6% in the year to March. However, the rate is expected to jump following a series of household bill increases at the start of April \u2013 including energy and water prices.",
      "The Bank said it expected inflation to rise \"temporarily\" to 3.5% this year due to the bill increases before falling back due lower oil and gas prices set to feed through in the coming months.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank expects UK growth for the first three months of this year to be stronger than it originally forecast at 0.6%, boosted by US firms stockpiling goods ahead of Trump's tariffs coming into effect. The official figures are set to be released next week.",
      "A boost in growth would be welcome news to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority in order to boost living standards.",
      "The government's Budget decision to increase National Insurance last month for employers kicked in last month, but the Bank said the effect of the tax increase \"appears to have been fairly small to date\", though it added business confidence had taken a hit in recent months.",
      "A lot of firms are taking a \"wait and see\" approach to whether the UK economy picks up before hiring and investing, it said.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest rate cut was \"welcome news\", but added: \"There is more to do, and I know families are still facing cost of living pressures.",
      "Mr Bailey said the UK had \"still a lot to do\" on growth: \"We have seen over the last, really since the financial crisis, 15 years or so now, the rates of growth be consistently lower than they were before that.\"",

      "No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details.",
      "Speaking from a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands, Sir Keir Starmer described the agreement as a \"fantastic platform\".",

      "US agreement leaves the UK open to do a much more significant EU deal",

      "The two sides said the US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars - which Trump had raised by 25% last month - to 10% for 100,000 cars a year.",
      "That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs.",
      "\"This was very serious,\" he said. \"It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough.\"",
      "Tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump raised earlier this year to 25%, have also been slashed, according to the Prime Minister's Office. The US said instead it would establish a quota, as had existed previously.",
      "The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country, according to documents released by the US Trade Representative.",
      "The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20% duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes.",
      "Overall, the US said the deal would create a $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) \"opportunity\" for exports, including $700m in ethanol and $250m in other agricultural products.",

      "UK Steel director General Gareth Stace welcomed the agreement, saying it would offer \"major relief\" to the steel sector.",
      "\"The UK government's cool-headed approach and perseverance in negotiating with the US clearly paid off,\" he said.",

      "\"I'm trying to be excited but I'm struggling a bit.\"",
      "While Labour MPs praised the deal, opposition parties asked for more detail and scrutiny in Parliament.",
      "Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US.",
      "\"This is not a historic deal with the US,\" she said. \"We've been shafted.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats demanded a vote on the deal in Parliament, saying it would show \"complete disrespect to the public\" if MPs were denied a say.",
      "Sir Ed Davey said: \"When it comes to any trade deal - and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald Trump - the devil will be in the detail.",
      "\"One thing is clear, Trump's trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries, threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK.\"",

      "But the US has long pushed for changes to benefit its farmers and pharmaceutical issues, which had been non-starters politically for the UK.",
      "It was not clear how much those issues had advanced.",
      "The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the agreement in-principle had delivered a \"tremendous win\" for American ranchers but the US Meat Export Federation, which tracks trade barriers for farmers in the US, said it was still trying to pin down information about the changes.",

      "Heathrow was closed to all flights for much of 21 March after a fire at a nearby electrical substation, which started the previous night, caused a power outage at the airport.",
      "In Thursday's report, the National Energy System Operator (Neso) said a transformer disconnected and caught fire at the substation in Hayes, west London.",
      "The grid operator's final report is due by the end of June. Heathrow Airport said it welcomed the interim findings and that it hoped the final report would provide answers on what caused the fire.",
      "The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit carried out an initial investigation into the fire, but Neso noted that detectives found there \"no evidence to suggest\" the incident was suspicious.",
      "The power outage and subsequent closure of Heathrow led to more than 270,000 journeys being affected.",

      "The power outage affected 66,919 domestic and commercial customers, including Heathrow Airport, Neso said.",

      "Neso's chief executive Fintan Slye said: \"It is important that the right lessons are learnt from this incident to prevent future instances where possible and to manage them effectively when they do occur.\"",
      "Power was restored to Heathrow's substations by 06:25 using circuits from another nearby substation, Neso said, and the flow of electricity to all four of Heathrow's passenger terminals was restarted by 10:56.",
      "But Flights did not resume until after 18:00 that day, once safety checks were completed. Planes were able to land and take off through the night to allow Heathrow to get back up to full capacity.",
      "Neso said the re-energisation of the entire airport was only fully completed by 14:23.",
      "Other customers' power was restored by 12:24, the report said, and supply from the North Hyde substation was reinstated the following day.",
      "Heathrow relies on three electricity substations, and has emergency back-up power supplies, such as diesel generators and batteries - but these only keep crucial safety systems running, such as landing equipment and runway lights.",
      "Heathrow's chief executive Thomas Woldbye previously said the shutdown was caused not by a lack of power but by the time it took to switch from the damaged substation's supply to the other operational substations.",

      "Last week she determined Apple was flouting that demand - a finding Apple has now called \"extraordinary.\"",

      "Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.",
      "One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.",
      "Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.",
      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",

      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",

    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",

      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though,\" she said.",
      "Interest rates are the Bank's main tool in try to maintain the annual rate of inflation at, or close to, its target of 2%.",

      "The Bank said it expected inflation to rise \"temporarily\" to 3.5% this year due to the bill increases before falling back due lower oil and gas prices set to feed through in the coming months.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",

      "The Bank expects UK growth for the first three months of this year to be stronger than it originally forecast at 0.6%, boosted by US firms stockpiling goods ahead of Trump's tariffs coming into effect. The official figures are set to be released next week.",
      "A boost in growth would be welcome news to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority in order to boost living standards.",

      "Mr Bailey said the UK had \"still a lot to do\" on growth: \"We have seen over the last, really since the financial crisis, 15 years or so now, the rates of growth be consistently lower than they were before that.\"",

      "When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.",

    "story": [
      "More than four in 10 universities in England are expecting to be in a financial deficit by this summer, according to new report from the Office for Students (OfS).",
      "The OfS, which regulates higher education providers, said universities were closing courses and selling buildings to cut costs, but \"significant reform and efficiencies\" were needed to turn the tide.",
      "It said a drop in international students coming to the UK was the main reason for the worsening financial position.",
      "Universities UK (UUK) said the report was \"deeply sobering\", while the education secretary said it demonstrated the necessity of raising tuition fees in England.",
      "The report found that 117 of 270 higher education institutions (43%) registered with the OfS expected to be in deficit by the end of July - despite course closures, job losses and selling off assets.",
      "This third consecutive year of worsening finances was mainly driven by a fall in international student numbers, it said, particularly following visa changes in January 2024.",
      "The number of international students was almost 16% lower last year than previously expected, according to the report.",
      "Universities have become increasingly reliant on higher fees from international students in recent years, as tuition fees from UK students have not kept up with inflation.",
      "Their financial plans predict that more than half of the growth in their tuition fee income up to 2028 will come from international students - but the OfS warned that this was optimistic.",
      "Susan Lapworth, chief executive of the OfS, told the BBC it was \"not currently expecting any large or medium institutions to fail over the next 12 months or so\".",
      "She said: \"Many institutions are financially secure or taking sensible steps to ensure that they're financially secure, so I wouldn't want students to be unduly concerned about these issues.\"",
      "But she went on to say that the OfS was working with a small number of institutions that were \"under real pressure\", including ensuring they drew up plans to protect students in the event that they were forced to close.",
      "Ms Lapworth said OfS was \"constantly thinking\" about when students might need to be told about the situation at those institutions, explaining: \"We know that if the regulator says 'we're working with a particular university', the risk is that its financial failure is then precipitated by simply saying that.\"",
      "The OfS has also said that any student going to university this autumn should expect the course to be delivered as advertised.",
      "Why are university tuition fees going up?",
      "Everything you need to know about student loans",
      "University tuition fees rising to \u00a39,535 in England",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the figures were \"concerning\" and demonstrated why raising tuition fees in England from this autumn was necessary.",
      "\"Further reforms are needed to fix the foundations of higher education, and universities must do more to make their finances work,\" she added.",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of UUK, which represents 141 institutions, said the report was \"deeply sobering\" but not surprising given frozen domestic tuition fees, visa changes and \"a longstanding failure of research grants to cover costs\".",
      "She said universities were doing \"everything they can\" to manage costs and that a UUK sector-wide taskforce would \"unlock greater efficiencies\".",
      "But she added: \"The scale of the challenge means none of this will be enough without government on the pitch too.\"",
      "Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said universities were \"under severe financial stress\".",
      "\"Over 10,000 jobs are already set to disappear from the sector as vice-chancellors attempt to bin courses and cut student provision to the bone,\" she said.",
      "She added that university staff would gather in London on Saturday, calling on the government and university leaders to \"protect higher education, one of our last world-leading sectors\".",
      "University cash crisis to get worse despite tuition fee rise, BBC told",
      "Why tuition fees are set to rise - and what this means for students",
      "'My university course made me who I am - now it's being cut'",
      "A recent snapshot of the financial decisions of 60 of the 141 institutions in UUK found that almost half of those responding had closed courses or reduced options for students in the last three years.",
      "Industrial disputes are under way in several cities as a result.",
      "Universities are now anxiously awaiting the government's draft plan for managing immigration,  which is expected to further limit visas for students applying from Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.",
      "Attracting international students who pay higher fees and spend money in the UK is counted as an export.  The rule change in January 2024 prevented postgraduate students from bringing relatives, and has led to a drop in numbers applying.",
      "The higher fees paid by international students have been used to prop up university finances after many years in which tuition fees for students in England have barely increased.",
      "While fees are due to go up this autumn to \u00a39,535 for students in England,  ministers have yet to say what will happen in following years.",
      "The government is carrying out a review of university education, including funding, which is due to report this summer.",

      "Dani Dyer shot to fame on Love Island, winning the 2018 series. She and her father have since appeared together on Celebrity Gogglebox, an Italian travel series, and on their podcast Sorted With The Dyers.",
      "'A lot of bad decisions'",
      "Danny Dyer, who shot to fame in the 1999 film Human Traffic, has gone on to become one of the most recognisable stars of British TV and film.",
      "In his interview, the 47-year-old spoke about how fame has affected his personal life, leading him to make \"a lot of bad decisions\".",
      "He said at one stage of his career, he was \"doing a lot of drugs\".",
      "\"I'd go to nightclubs and DJ sometimes but in general just wave off of balconies and I'd get paid quite a lot of money to do it,\" he added.",
      "Dyer says looking back is \"awful\" and that his days of \"hedonism\" and \"mad behaviour\" are over.",
      "He said one of his turning points came in 2013, when he was offered the role of Queen Vic landlord Mick Carter in EastEnders, which he says he took because he \"had no money\".",
      "\"I had bailiffs [coming round], no-one would hire me and the more I'm doing these club appearances, the more drugs I'm taking, and drink, so I'm in this weird spiral.\"",
      "Four years later, he made the decision to go to rehab in Cape Town during an awards show after-party at his house.",
      "\"I remember I had this moment where I was sitting in my ensuite trying to work out how to put a pair of jeans on - I was that off my head.",
      "\"I looked up, I looked at my wife and I could just see how tired she looked and I could hear kids running around downstairs, and I thought 'I need to sort my life out',\" he added.",
      "Dyer says it made him realise how addiction \"affects so many people around you, not just yourself\".",
      "Dyer recalls theatre fail after night on drugs",
      "Danny Dyer to leave EastEnders this year",
      "Danny Dyer: 'I have posh kids since moving to Essex'",
      "Dyer, who is nominated for best male comedy performance at Sunday's Bafta TV Awards for his role in Mr. Bigstuff, has also experienced success with Disney hit Rivals this year.",
      "He said a lot of the work he took in the early stages of his career was due to the lack of money he had and the added pressure of becoming a first-time parent with his now-wife Joanne at the age of 19.",
      "\"I'd made a few films but I just wasn't getting paid any money and I was desperate to get on the property ladder,\" he said.",
      "\"I was still living on a council estate with my daughter and Jo.\"",
      "Dyer says he then got offered a documentary series in 2006 called The Real Football Factories and \"couldn't believe the money that was offered to me\".",
      "\"I can't watch them back now [the documentaries], I cringe at them, but I needed to earn money, I needed to get a house and I needed to do the right thing,\" he added.",
      "You can listen to Danny Dyer's episode of Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 at 10:00 on Sunday. Alternatively, an edited version of the show will be available on BBC Sounds after it has been broadcast."

    "summary": "Rivals and Slow Horses are also nominated at the ceremony, which will be hosted by Alan Cumming.",
    "story": [
      "Baby Reindeer and Mr Bates vs the Post Office will go head to head at the Bafta TV Awards, which take place later at London's Royal Festival Hall.",
      "The event is one of the most prestigious in the TV calendar, and will see shows broadcast in 2024 compete for awards voted for by the British Academy.",
      "First screened by ITV in January 2024, Mr Bates vs the Post Office was one of the most impactful shows of the year and led to widespread public outcry about the wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters.",
      "Baby Reindeer, meanwhile, was a breakout viral hit for Netflix about an aspiring comedian and his stalker, but it also prompted a defamation claim from the woman said to have inspired it.",
      "The TV Baftas mark the final stop on the awards circuit for both shows, after wins at other events such as the Emmys, Golden Globes, SAG and National Television Awards.",
      "Which shows have the most Bafta nominations?",
      "4 nominations - Baby Reindeer, Mr Bates vs The Post Office3 - Rivals, Slow Horses, Mr Loverman, Say Nothing, The Traitors2 - Sherwood, Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, Gavin & Stacey: The Finale",
      "4 nominations - Baby Reindeer, Mr Bates vs The Post Office",
      "3 - Rivals, Slow Horses, Mr Loverman, Say Nothing, The Traitors",
      "2 - Sherwood, Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, Gavin & Stacey: The Finale",
      "Scroll down for the nominations list in full",
      "The above tallies include nominations for the memorable moment prize, the only award voted by the public.",
      "The numbers do not include the shows' earlier nominations and wins at the Bafta Craft Awards, which took place last month and saw Baby Reindeer's Richard Gadd take home best comedy writing, with Slow Horses and Inside No. 9 among the other winners.",
      "The Post Office scandal is widely considered the biggest miscarriage of justice in modern British history, and saw hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongly prosecuted and convicted of crimes they didn't commit, based on inaccurate data from the Horizon software system.",
      "The story was reported in the media over several years, but ITV dramatisation Mr Bates vs the Post Office brought it a new league of public attention and prompted the government to announce new legislation to exonerate and compensate victims.",
      "Meanwhile, Baby Reindeer told the story of a struggling stand-up comedian, the woman who stalks him, and the powerful man in the TV industry who mentors and then sexually assaults him. Richard Gadd's partly autobiographical drama became one of the most dissected series of the year.",
      "Other nominees include Rivals, a Disney+ adaptation of a Jilly Cooper novel about two powerful men battling for control of a local TV network, and Slow Horses, about a dysfunctional unit within MI5 made up of disgraced agents.",
      "Say Nothing, which followed the lives of those growing up during the troubles in Belfast, is also nominated, alongside Mr Loverman, a screen adaptation of Bernadine Evaristo's novel about an elderly man whose marriage falls apart after his long-term affair with his male friend is revealed.",
      "Sherwood focused on a Nottinghamshire community still reeling from the 1980s miners' strike, while Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light continued Hilary Mantel's trilogy about Thomas Cromwell's continued rise to power and eventual fall from grace.",
      "Other nominees include reality series The Traitors, a game of deception played in a Scottish castle, and Gavin & Stacey: The Finale, which saw the long-running series about two families from from Billericay in Essex and Barry in Wales reach an emotional conclusion.",
      "Who is hosting the Bafta TV Awards?",
      "Actor and TV presenter Alan Cumming will take over hosting duties this year, and we hope he brings just as much drama as he did to the latest cracking series of The Traitors US.",
      "The Scottish star's film credits include Eyes Wide Shut, GoldenEye and Emma, as well as two absolute masterpieces of 1990s cinema - Spice World: The Movie and Romy and Michele's High School Reunion.",
      "Bafta's executive director of awards and content, Emma Baehr, said Cumming would \"definitely bring a playful sense of mischief and fun to the ceremony\".",
      "Elsewhere in the ceremony, Jessie J will deliver her first TV performance in six years, singing the appropriately titled The Award Goes To, while Tom Grennan will perform his new single Full Attention.",
      "Awards will be presented by stars including Dame Mary Berry, Billy Porter, Suranne Jones, Ashley Walters, Katie Piper, Sir David Suchet, Big Zuu, Ellie Simmonds, Owen Cooper, Rose Ayling Ellis, Stacey Dooley and Baroness Benjamin.",
      "How to watch the Bafta TV Awards",
      "The ceremony will be broadcast on BBC One at 19:00 BST.",
      "But it actually takes place a couple of hours earlier, so that some sections of the ceremony can be edited down before the show airs.",
      "BBC News will be running spoiler-free coverage, with winners revealed on our live page in line with when they are announced on BBC One.",

    "summary": "Eurovision songwriters, judges and more discuss crafting the ideal anthem.",
    "story": [
      "The Eurovision Song Contest was watched by around 163 million people last year \u2013 meaning there are potentially 163 million different opinions on what makes a perfect entrant.",
      "Do you go for a soulful ballad, guaranteed to leave Europe misty-eyed and full of love and peace?",
      "Or do you opt for a cheesy extravaganza, complete with saucy takes on regional costumes and eye-popping staging that will have the entire continent (and Australia) raving in their living rooms?",
      "The perfect song",
      "Forensic musicologist at Boston's Berklee College of Music Joe Bennett has analysed hundreds of Eurovision finalists, identifying two dominant musical styles.",
      "One is the \"Euro-banger\" - high-energy, 120+ BPM songs with kick drums and synth-heavy production, like Sweden's winning entries Euphoria (Loreen, 2012) and Heroes (M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w, 2015).",
      "The other is the slow-burning ballad - typically around 70 BPM, such as Portugal's Amar Pelos Dois (Salvador Sobral, 2017) and the Netherlands' Arcade (Duncan Laurence, 2019).",
      "There is a clich\u00e9 that Eurovision songs are only about love and peace \u2013 reinforced by a song performed during the 2016 contest's interval about writing a perfect Eurovision song, called Love Love Peace Peace.",
      "According to Bennett, there is some validity to this, with every Eurovision song falling under six broad lyrical themes: \"love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history and songs about making music\".",
      "He adds that \"songs of self-assertion or lyrical self-empowerment do very well\" - as seen with Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix (Conchita Wurst).",
      "Keep staging simple and effective",
      "Acts might be tempted to go over the top on staging, but this may not be the way to secure victory, according to our experts.",
      "Songwriter Thomas Stengaard co-wrote Denmark's 2013 winner Only Teardrops (as well as this year's UK entry What the Hell Just Happened by Remember Monday). He puts his success down, in part, to its simple staging, which he says made it easy to remember.",
      "\"If you asked a kid to draw that staging, they could. It was a girl with no shoes on, two guys playing the drums and a flute guy. Very simple, but it worked.\"",
      "Vocal coach Carrie Grant, who led the UK's jury in 2014 and came sixth in the contest as part of Sweet Dreams in 1983, agrees.",
      "\"There is nothing worse than having an artist whose stage has lots of money but their performance doesn't warrant it,\" she says. \"It makes that performance seem worse.\"",
      "The 2014 winner (and Carrie's personal favourite) was Conchita Wurst \u2013 the first act to win the contest without backing singers or dancers on stage since 1970.",
      "What made Conchita stand out was that she was a bearded drag queen. Carrie believes Eurovision fans love things that are quirky and that \"embrace the LGBT community\".",
      "But she adds that Conchita wasn't a gimmick but instead \"a brilliant singer who could deliver what we call in vocal coaching 'money moments'\".",
      "The key is key",
      "Minor-key songs increasingly dominate Eurovision.",
      "Bennett debunks the idea that \"major equals happy, minor equals sad\", adding that \"minor keys are more a shorthand for emotional depth\".",
      "In 2023, 85% of finalists performed in minor keys, according to the Press Association. In the last 20 years, only two major-key songs have won - 2011's Running Scared (for Azerbaijan) and 2017's Amar Pelos Dois.",
      "Professor Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis, a researcher in music cognition at Princeton, highlights source sensitivity \u2013 our instinct to associate a song's sound with its intended context. A few bars of a techno song, for example, and we have a mental image of a dark nightclub, and of the sort of DJ who might perform there.",
      "This means certain minor keys now immediately signal \"Eurovision-ness\" to audiences.",
      "Remember Monday's What the Hell Just Happened was written at a songwriting camp, with multiple songwriters working together at a countryside retreat to write the perfect song for this year's UK act.",
      "The song was intentionally written in a major key to stand out in a sea of minor-key songs - similar to the UK's 2022 second-place entry, Spaceman by Sam Ryder (B Major).",

      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Have a surprise up your sleeve",
      "Repetition is important to make a song stick in the mind, says Margulis. But songs should avoid being too repetitive. Margulis says that what particularly makes a song catchy is \"not only when they are heard repeatedly, but also when they throw in some kind of surprise twist\".",
      "Bucks Fizz's 1981 winner for the UK, Making Your Mind Up, is a classic example. First, the song changes key, quickly followed by a memorable costume change in which the female singers' skirts were ripped off to reveal shorter skirts \u2013 a joint visual and musical twist.",
      "Earlier Eurovision winners were often mocked for their nonsense lyrics, like Sweden's 1984 winner Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley, but Bennett argues this highlights Eurovision's strong focus on melody.",
      "\"Eurovision really needs big melodic hooks. You want people across Europe to be singing that melody. The need for a very accessible, catchy chorus is essential.\"",
      "Key changes have long been a way to introduce novelty into Eurovision songs. The 2000s saw multiple winners follow this formula, including Olsen Brothers' Fly on the Wings of Love for Norway (2000), and Serbia's Molitva in 2007.",
      "But as Bennett points out, though they are still present in around a fifth of finalists, no song with a final chorus key change has won since Molitva almost 20 years ago.",
      "Stengaard's song for this year's UK act Remember Monday is certainly full of surprises. BBC music correspondent Mark Savage said the song featured \"a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts\".",
      "The song is the songwriter's answer to the question he asks himself whenever he writes for Eurovision: \"How do you stand out in a contest where everyone wants to stand out?\"",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's representatives have told the BBC she is being brought into a legal row between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively to create \"tabloid clickbait\".",
      "The 35-year-old singer was summoned to a US court after it was alleged she encouraged Baldoni to accept script re-writes by Lively for It Ends With Us, a film that both starred in and is the centre of a sexual harassment case.",
      "Baldoni says he was invited to Lively's New York home in 2023 to discuss script changes, where Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, and Swift were there to serve as her \"dragons\".",
      "Representatives for Swift said \"she was not involved in any casting or creative decision\" and \"never saw an edit or made any notes on the film\".",
      "Lively, 37, sued Baldoni, 41, in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign. Baldoni is counter-suing Lively and her husband, the actor Ryan Reynolds, on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "Lively and Baldoni have been locked in a dispute since the film, which is an adaption of a Colleen Hoover novel, was released last summer.",
      "According to Baldoni, there were tensions over the 2023 re-write of the scene, at which he was surprised to find Reynolds and Swift present.",
      "He alleges Lively wrote in a text to him: \"If you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you'll appreciate that I'm Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for.\"",
      "Baldoni says he responded supportively, writing: \"I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor).",
      "\"You really are a talent across the board. Really excited and grateful to do this together.\"",
      "It is also alleged that Swift was involved in the casting of Isabela Ferrer in the film, who played a younger version of Lively's character, Lily Bloom.",
      "Speaking at the New York premiere of It Ends With Us, Ferrer said: \"She [Taylor Swift] was a helpful part of the audition, which I found out later when I got it, and that rocked my world.\"",
      "But Swift's representatives said the only involvement she had in the film was permitting the use of her song, My Tears Ricochet, noting that she was among 20 artists featured in the film.",
      "Swift \"never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, [and] she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film\", they said.",
      "They added that Swift did not see It Ends With Us until \"weeks after its release\" as she was \"travelling around the globe\" on tour at the time.",
      "The popstar's spokespeople argued that the subpoena \"designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case\".",

    "story": [
      "The 2025 Eurovision Song Contest pops its cork on Sunday, with a \"turquoise carpet\" parade featuring competitors from all 37 nations.",
      "But the competition really begins on Tuesday, when the first semi-final will see five countries unceremoniously kicked out.",
      "Another six will lose their place at the second semi-final on Thursday, before the Grand Final takes place in Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday, 17 May.",
      "This year's entrants include two returning contestants, one professional opera singer, a thinly veiled allusion to sexual emissions and a dance anthem about a dead space dog.",
      "It's a lot to take in.",
      "To help you prepare, here's a guide to all 37 songs in the contest, which I've sorted into rough musical categories, mainly for my own sanity (it didn't work).",
      "Left-field pop bangers",
      "Win or lose, UK contestants Remember Monday have given headline writers a gift with the title of their entry: What The Hell Just Happened?",
      "A souped-up, full throttle pop anthem, it cherry-picks the best bits of Queen, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Beatles, presumably to remind voters of Britain's rich musical heritage.",
      "With eight tempo changes, it could prove tricky for voters to grasp, but the band's stellar harmonies and sparkling personalities should carry them through.",
      "Crucially, the song avoids the Eurovision cliches of jackhammer dance anthems and windswept balladry \u2013 something Remember Monday have in common with this year's favourites.",
      "Sweating it out at the top are Swedish representatives KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the restorative powers of the sauna, complete with dancers in skimpy towels.",
      "Unreasonably catchy, it's won the approval of Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus, whose been   singing the track in his own private sauna. As you do.",
      "Stiff competition comes from Austrian singer JJ, and his operatic ballad Wasted Love.",
      "A timeworn story of unrequited love, it leans on his training as a counter-tenor, before exploding into an unexpected techno breakdown.",
      "A favourite with the bookies, the song's only Achilles heel is its similarity to last year's winner, Nemo.",
      "Distinctive in a different way is Ireland's entry, Laika Party \u2013 a 90s trance-pop anthem about a dog who was sent to space by Russia and left to die there.",
      "Singer Emmy aims for a hopeful spin on a tragic story but, despite a peppy performance, it's a bit of a downer.",
      "More palatable is Luxembourg's Laura Thorn, whose La Poup\u00e9e Monte Le Son is a callback to France Gall's 1965 winning entry, Poup\u00e9e De Cire, Poup\u00e9e De Son.",
      "Where the original was about a \"fashion doll\" operated by songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, Thorn's response is all about taking control.",
      "\"If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mum,\" she scolds. Yeouch.",
      "Other countries sucking up to Italy",
      "Rome must be blushing. This year features not one, but two, songs about the vibrant culture of Il Bel Paese.",
      "The first comes, not surprisingly, from San Marino \u2013 the independent microstate that nestles inside north-central Italy.",
      "Titled Tutta L'Italia, it celebrates everything from the county's football team and its vineyards, to the Mona Lisa (under her Italian name Gioconda).",
      "Written by Gabry Ponte \u2013 one of the brains behind Eiffel 65's Blue (Da Ba Dee) \u2013 it's a slight, but fun, mixture of dance beats, traditional accordion playing and the folk dances of Calabria.",
      "The staging could be its downfall, though, with Gabry marooned behind his DJ decks while the singers, who for some reason wish to remain anonymous, obscure their faces with masks.",
      "More memorable, but definitely more unhinged, is Estonia's Espresso Macchiato.",
      "Performed by Tommy Cash (the only Eurovision contestant to have appeared on a Charli XCX record) it's an affectionate-ish caricature of Italian stereotypes, featuring the indelible lyric: \"Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it\".",
      "Smut!",
      "I'm trying to give up sexual innuendo, but Eurovision is making it har... difficult.",
      "A trio of artists are trying to sneak smut past the censors, led by Malta's Miriana Conte, with a throbbing club track called Serving.",
      "In its original form, the song's chorus revolved around the phrase \"serving kant\" \u2013 the word kant being Maltese for \"singing\" and a homophone for an English term that definitely doesn't mean singing.",
      "It's a reference to a well-known phrase in the drag / ballroom world; but several countries complained it broke broadcasting guidelines, prompting a hasty re-write.",
      "If the stunt was meant to generate headlines it worked, but now that Miriana has our attention, she's not letting go.",
      "Her performance, featuring a giant disco ball pursed between two red lips, is gloriously OTT, and she has an enviable set of pipes. Too bad the song is riddled with Europop cliche.",
      "Another contestant doubling his entendres is Australia's Go-Jo, who wants us to \"take a sip\" of milkshake from his \"special cup\". Interpret that how you want but I'd be wary of hitching a lift in his ice cream van, if I were you.",
      "With a smattering of Electric Six's saucy disco funk, Milkshake Man is tasty enough to get Australia back in the finals after only achieving a semi last year.",
      "Finally, we have Finland's Erika Vikman, whose song Ich Komme is billed as a \"joyous message of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance\".",
      "Structured to mimic the pneumatic realities of lovemaking, it recalls iconic gay anthems such as Kylie's Your Disco Needs You and Donna Summer's Hot Stuff \u2013 and ends with Erika shooting into the sky astride a massive gold microphone that's definitely not a stand-in for a phallus.",
      "Three songs inspired by cancer",
      "Little in life is more devastating than the phrase \"I'm afraid it's cancer\".",
      "The disease will affect one in two of us and, although survival rates have dramatically improved, the impact can be devastating.",
      "This year, three separate Eurovision contestants have been touched by cancer, inspiring songs of unmatched heartbreak and reflection.",
      "French singer Louane captures it best. Her song Maman, is an intimate conversation with her mother, who died when she was just 17 years old.",
      "Over three verses, Louane describes the \"emptiness\" she was felt; and how she filled the void with bad behaviour and meaningless love affairs. But, as the song progresses, she tells her mum she's settled down and found purpose... by becoming a mother herself.",
      "She sings it beautifully, with a mixture of regret and strength. And when her daughter's voice appears in the final moments of the song, it would take a steely heart not to shed a tear.",
      "Over in Norway, 19-year-old Kyle Alessandro shared a similar story, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Thankfully, she's now in remission, but something she said during her treatment inspired his Eurovision entry: \"Never lose your light.\"",
      "Kyle took that phrase and turned it into a thumping pop song about surviving adversity. \"Nothing can burn me now,\" he sings. \"I'm my own Lighter.\"",
      "Klemen Slakonja, meanwhile, is a comedian best known in Slovenia for his impressions of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin -  but his ballad, How Much Time Do We Have Left was written after his wife, actress Mojca Fatur, was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer.",
      "As he sings, Klemen's dancers raise him into the air and hold him upside down, to represent the disorientation the family felt.",
      "\"When she read her diagnosis, our world turned upside down and I felt that rush of blood in my head, the same one I feel whenever I am upside down in the performance,\" he told Eurovision World.",
      "Defying the odds, Mojca survived, and joins him on stage at Eurovision. It's a deeply intimate and moving moment.",
      "The bops",
      "Listening to this year's line-up, it's like the contestants all heard Cascada's Evacuate the Dancefloor and went, \"Nah, we're good, thanks\".",
      "There are club bangers everywhere, with Belgium's Red Sebastian (named after the crab in The Little Mermaid, bless him) submitting an entire song about the loved-up liberation of an all-night rave.",
      "\"Where no words are needed to feel the connection / Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending.\"",
      "A favourite with fans, the 90s rave elements of Strobe Lights feel a little dated to me, but his meticulously-choreographed performance is a treat.",
      "Denmark's Sissal takes a similar sound, with a throwback Euro-bop called Hallucination that effortlessly evokes two-time Eurovision winner Loreen.",
      "Sissal said her biggest goal was for the audience to feel they couldn't sit down during the song. Mission accomplished.",
      "Germany, meanwhile, are pitching for a home run with Baller, a super-catchy trance anthem that wouldn't sound out of place at Berlin superclub Berghain.",
      "Performed by Austrian siblings Abor & Tynna, it's languishing in the middle of the field, after Tynna developed laryngitis, robbing the duo of the chance to impress fans at Eurovision's various pre-parties. But now that she's recovered, the song could rise up the rankings.",
      "That's less likely for V\u00e6b, aka the Icelandic Jedward. Their energetic dance-rap song, R\u00f3a, is all about rowing from Iceland to the Faroe Islands, \"because no matter what happens in life you just keep on rowing through the waves\".",
      "Sadly, it's not as deep as it sounds.",
      "Spanish star Melody fares better with Esa Diva, a pumping house track with a sprinkling of flamenco guitar, that documents her journey to fame.",
      "And Azerbaijan's Mamagama go all Maroon 5 on Run With U, a smooth pop song elevated by a twinkling riff on the saz \u2013 a long-necked plucked instrument similar to the lute.",
      "Post-immigrant pop",
      "OK, so I've stolen that description from Shkodra Elektronike.",
      "They're an Albanian duo living in Italy, who fuse the ethnic music of their hometown, Shkod\u00ebr, to a progressive electronic sound.",
      "Their song Zjerm (Fire) imagines a time when cross-cultural understanding would lead to peace and harmony \u2013 a world without a need for soldiers and ambulances, and where \"oil would smell like lilac\" (no, me neither).",
      "Greece's entry, Asterom\u00e1ta, is also rooted in history and memory, as Klavdia describes the unbreakable bond that refugees share with their homeland.",
      "\"Even if they cross the seas / They shall never forget the sacred earth they called home,\" she sings, in a haunting ballad that blends traditional Greek and Pontic elements with soaring strings.",
      "Taking a more upbeat approach is Dutch singer Claude. A refugee from the bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he moved to the Netherlands at the age of nine and fell in love with Eurovision while waiting in the refugee centre.",
      "His song, C'est La Vie, is a tribute to his mum, who taught him to see the positive in their situation.",
      "Fizzing with freedom and joy, it combines elements of chanson and French-Caribbean zouk, and looks set for a top 10 placing.",
      "Witchcraft, sorcery and moody goth boys",
      "The success of \"goth gremlin witch\" Bambie Thug at last year's Eurovision has conjured a veritable coven of imitators in 2025.",
      "Polish singer Justyna Steczkowska, representing her country for the second time, even includes a Slavic magic spell in her song, Gaja \u2013 summoning the spirit of the mother Earth to \"cleanse\" her of a toxic relationship.",
      "It's a suitably intense performance, with Justyna singing long sustained notes and playing a furious violin solo, before being hoiked into the rafters on a pair ropes.",
      "What a time to be alive.",
      "Marko Bo\u0161njak, meanwhile, is cooking up a Poison Cake to feed to his tormentors - chiefly the people who bombarded him with homophobic hate messages after he was selected to represent Croatia.",
      "The criticism was so intense that he lost his voice and couldn't leave the house for five days.",
      "His song is suitably melodramatic, replete with guttural synths and creepy playground chants. It's a little overbaked, but should still sail through to the finals.",
      "Taking a more ethereal approach are Latvian group Tautumeitas, whose song Bur Man Laimi translates as \"a chant for happiness\".",
      "Reminiscent of Bjork and Enya, its overlapping folk harmonies are based on traditional Latvian wedding songs, making it one of this year's most captivating entries. I fear it may be too subtle to score well, though.",
      "Further mystery is provided by, Theo Evan, Cyprus's answer to Nick Jonas. The lyrics to his song, Shh, are a riddle, written by former tennis player Elke Tiel, whose \"hidden truth will only be revealed on the Eurovision stage in May\".",
      "He opens his performance perched between two pieces of scaffolding in a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man sketch \u2013 so there's a clue.",
      "Shh is one of a number of gothic pop songs, sung by brooding young men with interesting hair.",
      "Among the best is Kiss Kiss Goodbye, by Czechia's Adonxs, who divebombs from an angelic falsetto to an unsettling baritone as he confronts his absent father.",
      "Lithuanian band Katarsis are an interesting experiment, with a deliberately downbeat rock song that declares \"the foundations of everything have begun to rot\".",
      "Titled Tavo Akys (your eyes), it builds to a compelling climax, but it's hard to see it being a vote-winner, unless Eurovision suddenly attracts an audience of depressed emo teens.",
      "Rounding out the field are Armenian singer Parg, with the Imagine Dragons-inspired Survivor and Serbia's Princ, whose overwrought ballad is called Mila.",
      "Both performers give it their all, but the songs don't feel strong enough to survive the semi-finals.",
      "70s rock throwbacks",
      "Four years after M\u00e5neskin's victory, Eurovision's rock revival continues apace.",
      "Italy are back at it again, thanks to Lucio Corsi \u2013 think David Bowie as Pierrot \u2013 and his glam rock ballad Volevo Essere Un Duro (I wanted to be tough).",
      "A delicate anthem for people who feel they don't fit in, it recalls how Lucio was bullied as a kid, and how he's  grown to embrace his fragility. At one point, he sings: \"Instead of a star, [I'm] just a sneeze.\"",
      "It's a timeless bit of songwriting that pulls off that crucial Eurovision trick of sounding new and familiar all at once.",
      "Portuguese indie band Napa also have a 70s vibe, channelling Paul McCartney's Wings on the soft rock tear-jerker Deslocado (out of place).",
      "It's another song about migration, written after the band were forced to relocate from Madeira to the Portuguese mainland due to the economic crisis.",
      "\"Even though we've been here for a few years we always have that desire to go back, and that anguish of saying goodbye to family,\" said singer Guilherme Gomes.",
      "Last but not least are Ukraine's Ziferblat, who continue the country's astonishing run of high-quality entries in the midst of a war with Russia.",
      "Their song, Bird Of Pray, is an unexpected mix of 70s new wave band Cars, birdsong and the guitar riff from Rachel Stevens' Sweet Dreams My LA Ex \u2013 while the lyrics are full of hope for a peaceful reunion with their loved ones.",
      "It's better than that makes it sound.",
      "The ballads",
      "Where would Eurovision be without a raven-haired woman bellowing into a wind machine set to \"hurricane\"?",
      "Israel has strong form in this category, and sets the bar again with New Day Will Rise, a melancholy piano ballad sung in a mixture of English, French and Hebrew.",
      "The song's performed by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova music festival, where an attack by Hamas claimed the lives of 378 people and triggered Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.",
      "It's hard not to interpret her lyrics as a response to those events \u2013 \"everyone cries, don't cry alone\". As a result, her participation hasn't received the same level of criticism as Eden Golan, who represented Israel last year.",
      "That can't be said for Georgia's contestant, Mariam Shengelia, who has been booed during pre-Eurovision appearances for her alleged support of the country's authoritarian, pro-Russian, anti-LGBT ruling party, Georgian Dream.",

      "\"Lights, camera\u2026 tariff?\" - that's the question a scrambling movie industry has been asking this week after an unexpected intervention from US President Donald Trump.",
      "Writing on his Truth Social platform last Sunday, Trump announced plans to hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he attempts to stop Hollywood dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "His threat comes as studios increasingly shift productions abroad to places such as the UK.",
      "The White House has since clarified that \"no final decision\" has been made and that they're \"exploring all options\" for revitalising the US film industry.",
      "But Trump's suggestion alone has sent shockwaves through the industry - from Hollywood to Hertfordshire - so what might all of this mean in practice?",
      "In 2014, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was shot by Disney at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, and Hollywood has kept growing closer to the UK since.",
      "Last year alone, the British Film Institute says 65% of UK production spend came from the five major US film studios and three US streaming giants - Netflix, Apple and Amazon. This amounted to \u00a31.37bn ($1.71bn), a near 50% jump on 2023.",
      "In Hollywood, by contrast, film and television production in Los Angeles has dropped by nearly 40% over the past decade.",
      "The reason? Well largely, it's cheaper to make films in the UK. That's thanks to generous tax incentives such as the Film Tax Relief, which offers a 25% tax rebate - as well as lower labour costs and centralised national funding for film.",
      "As British actor Brian Cox told Times Radio on Tuesday: \"The reality is films go where they can afford.\"",
      "For Universal's blockbuster Jurassic World: Dominion, these incentives delivered a reported \u00a389.1m ($111.38m) in savings.",
      "In the US, tax incentives operate on a state level - and Hollywood has relatively poor tax breaks - not only compared with the UK, which can offer 10% more, but other states such as New York and Georgia, too.",
      "Fixing that is no easy task. Trump has appointed Golden Globe Award-winning actor Jon Voight, 86, as a special ambassador to Hollywood, and met with him a day before dropping his light-on-detail proposal.",
      "But it's not exactly clear how tariffs would solve the internal tax problem in the US. A possible solution, raised by Voight, is a federal tax incentive to mirror the UK.",
      "The Wrap's film reporter Jeremy Fuster tells the BBC it is \"unlikely\", in the current highly-charged climate, that Republicans would \"support a federal tax incentive that can easily be portrayed as a handout to 'woke Hollywood'\".",
      "And what would the impact be on moviegoers if the levy goes ahead?",
      "Fuster says costs, like any other tariffed good, would be passed onto audiences through ticket prices, premium on-demand increases or subscription rates.",
      "How exactly this would take form is \"something nobody knows\".",
      "It's not all about the money, because while a boost to US production could benefit parts of the industry, some projects will still need to shoot abroad. \"Amazon isn't going to make the next James Bond entirely in America,\" Fuster notes.",

      "\"Whatever I was doing - maybe cleaning up or doing homework - when I heard the 'oooh-oooh-oooooh',\" Adesoji Kukoyi says, mimicking the iconic Doctor Who theme tune, \"I dropped everything and ran straight to the television.\"",
      "As a child growing up in 1980s Nigeria, Mr Kukoyi was infatuated with sci-fi sensation Doctor Who. British shows like Allo Allo and Fawlty Towers aired regularly as a cultural hangover from the colonial era, but none captured Mr Kukoyi's imagination like the time-travelling Doctor did.",
      "\"He always spoke to me,\" 44-year-old Mr Kukoyi, who currently has a vintage Doctor Who theme as the ringtone on his phone, tells the BBC.",
      "\"Like there's somebody watching out for us... yes, we make mistakes, but we do our best, especially if we have a teacher that will lead us on the right path.\"",
      "Mr Kukoyi has been watching Doctor Who for decades, so when he heard that on Saturday an episode will, for the very first time, be set in Nigeria, he was elated.",
      "\"I was watching last week's episode with my wife and the preview [for the following week] said: 'Welcome to Lagos, Nigeria'. I screamed like a little girl!\" Mr Kukoyi says.",
      "The setting is momentous not just for Mr Kukoyi - a native of Nigeria's biggest and liveliest city Lagos - but for the show too. Saturday's adventure will be the first primarily set in Africa.",
      "It is fitting that the producers chose Nigeria for this milestone - in 2013, fans worldwide were delighted when nine lost Doctor Who episodes from the 1960s were unearthed in a Nigerian TV facility.",
      "Ariyon Bakare, who in the upcoming episode plays the mysterious Barber, says fans can expect \"a time-bending cultural ancestral collision\" and \"hair, lots of hair\".",
      "The preview also teases a vibrant barber shop, a brimming Lagos market and a towering, monstrous-looking spider.",
      "Fans speculate that this creature is Anansi, a legendary character in West African and Caribbean folktales, but scriptwriter Inua Ellams is keeping specifics under wraps.",
      "As for why the show has enjoyed such popularity in Nigeria, he says: \"There's something Nigerian about the Doctor. Nigerians are sort of loud, gregarious people... the Doctor is mysterious, boisterous, sort of over-confident but somehow manages to save the day.\"",
      "Ellams, who moved from Nigeria to the UK as a child, also considers why in 62 years, a character known to traverse the universe has barely spent any time in Africa.",
      "It could be that no writer has felt confident enough to produce an authentic African story, he says, or it might be down to the Doctor's need to \"blend into his environment and be inconspicuous\".",
      "\"Ncuti Gatwa [who plays the Doctor] being an actor of African descent means that we can tell new stories with the Doctor and negotiate in different spaces because of his appearance.",
      "\"And this is the brilliance of the show - every Doctor creates new opportunities to tell new stories in different ways,\" Ellams tells the BBC.",
      "But these fresh Doctor Who stories have a smaller reach than the old ones did, as the show is no longer broadcast on Nigerian public TV. If you are in the country and want to catch up on the Doctor's exploits, you would have to subscribe to streaming service Disney Plus.",
      "Regardless, Mr Kukoyi insists that a dedicated troop of Nigerian Doctor Who lovers will be sitting transfixed on their sofas on Saturday evening, bearing witness to the Tardis materialising in Lagos.",
      "\"I'm waiting with baited breath,\" he says. \"Finally, he is coming!\"",
      "Mr Kukoyi - whose first experience of the Doctor was one played by a stripy scarf-wearing Tom Baker - says his young daughters are not so taken with his beloved show.",
      "He is \"trying to get them onboard\", he says.",
      "Perhaps seeing the Doctor wearing traditional Nigerian clothing, squeezing his way through a quintessential Lagos market and getting caught up in local folklore will help them fall in love with the show the way their father once did.",

      "Kara Weipz still recalls how she and her family found out her brother Richard was among the dead - they heard it for the first time on a news report about the bombing.",
      "As well as adding to their trauma, she says it also highlighted faults in the response system for victims' families.",
      "\"I think it was very important to make sure those lessons were learned - like families had to be notified before names could be released,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "\"We didn't have that luxury in 1988, when names were released before we were notified. So that's something that came out of it, and changed as a result.\"",
      "As president of the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 group, a role she took on from her father Bob Monetti, she says it's crucial that relatives \"know what rights they have\", while stressing the group's role in \"educating those who deal with victims\".",
      "Those lessons went on to improve how victims' families were treated in the aftermath of 9/11, when four planes flying over the eastern US were seized simultaneously by hijackers, killing 2,977 people.",
      "Screenwriter Gillian Roger Park, who was born just a couple of days before the Lockerbie bombing and grew up not far from the Scottish town, is a co-writer on the series.",

      "\"After their lobbying and campaigning, a lot of the protocols introduced in the aftermath of 9/11 were based on what they campaigned for,\" she says.",
      "Airlines also benefited from their experiences.",
      "\"A lot of Pan Am 103 family members trained airlines on how to deal with victims,\" she adds.",
      "Kathryn Turman, played in the series by Severance actress Merritt Wever, was head of the Office for Victims of Crime, for the US Department of Justice.",
      "Turman arranged travel for family members plus secure closed-circuit viewing in the US, for the trial of two bombing suspects in the Netherlands, in 2000. The FBI notes this was unprecedented at the time.",
      "Weipz adds: \"We have victim services in the FBI, in the Department of Justice, in the US Attorney's office. Why? Well, because of Kathryn, but also because of the Pan Am 103 families.\"",
      "Turman's character poignantly says in one of the episodes: \"The families should have been protected and prioritised from the start... we can't make that mistake again.\"",
      "The drama also highlights that lobbying by UK and US-based family groups resulted in \"key reforms, from strengthening travel warning systems and tighter baggage screening, to people-centred responses to major disasters\".",
      "For the series' lead writer Jonathan Lee, creating a factual drama 37 years later was also a way of exploring the human stories behind the horror.",
      "A co-production with Netflix, the show shines a light on \"the story of these small, but heroic acts of connective humanity, in the wake of this bomb that tried to blast things apart\", he says.",
      "For such a dark topic, it has some surprisingly uplifting moments.",
      "We witness the strength of bonds forged between people, in the wake of the bombing.",
      "\"Collaboration between families, countries and law enforcement agencies gets us from the worst of humanity to the best of it\", former lawyer Lee tells the BBC.",
      "\"We piece things together by working together.\"",
      "The series is something of a jigsaw - we see the police and FBI painstakingly process thousands of fragments of evidence, in the build-up to Abdulbaset Al Megrahi being convicted over the bombing in 2001.",
      "Two years later, Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi accepted his country's responsibility for the bombing, and paid compensation to the victims' families.",
      "The other pieces in the TV drama's puzzle focus on the lives of the people of Lockerbie and beyond, with volunteers stepping up to help traumatised families.",
      "Weipz recalled one scene in the drama, where her father tries to reach a financial settlement for his son's death with the Pan Am insurance panel.",
      "\"That was one of the worst days of my life... hearing your brother really had no value because he was 20 years old, and was an assistant manager at a swim club and mowed lawns...",
      "\"Watching it, you see how horrifying it was.\"",
      "We also see women from Lockerbie, who made endless cakes for the investigators, washed victims' clothes before they were returned to families and showed relatives the spot where their loved ones died.",
      "\"It was important to flesh out those emotional, human stories, to bring the Scottish stories to life,\" says Roger Park about the volunteers.",
      "\"They did such hard work and it wasn't their jobs, they were just locals who felt a moral obligation to help.",
      "\"Those women are just like my gran, I know those types of women, and I just think we rarely centre on those kinds of domestic stories.",
      "\"And what strong stuff you'd have to be made of to do what they did. I just love that they used the tools of their domestic lives to do such heroic work.\"",
      "New York-based Michelle Lipkin, whose father Frank Ciulla was killed on the flight, speaks fondly about \"the women who laundered the clothes\", including Ella Ramsden and Moira Shearer.",

      "\"There's no words to describe the gratitude we have for them, because our loved ones were murdered.",
      "\"It's the most evil of evil, and so every piece of clothing they laundered, every meal they made for the searchers - that just brought back what is possible, and the human spirit and kindness.\"",
      "Weipz also speaks about the \"compassion\" shown by the people of Lockerbie in the hours after the bombing.",
      "\"People slept outside with the bodies too. They didn't want them to be alone. It just overwhelms me at the times when I think about it,\" she says.",
      "Scottish actress Lauren Lyle plays June, the wife of Det Sgt Ed McCusker, one of the lead Scottish police officers.",
      "She says although the investigation was a \"male-heavy story because it was the 80s\", she also thinks \"the women just stepped right up\", often behind the scenes.",

      "The pair met on the 2019 series of Love Island, later becoming engaged and welcoming their daughter Bambi in 2023.",
      "Hague announced their split last year, and suggested in her subsequent docuseries that Fury's drinking had become a problem in the relationship.",
      "But in the latest episodes, released on Friday, Hague confirmed they were back together, saying Fury had not drunk alcohol for four months and that \"things are looking so much better\".",
      "'He's really different these days'",
      "Hague is the most successful former Love Island contestant, with 8.5 million Instagram followers and her own clothing brand.",
      "Speaking in a new episode of her Amazon Prime Video docuseries, Behind It All Part II, Hague described the relationship as \"worth saving\".",
      "She added she does not want to rush anything with Fury but to take \"things slow\" as the couple rebuild.",
      "\"I love Tommy so much and I love our family so much that I'm willing to ride the wave,\" Hague said.",
      "\"And that's not something that everyone wants to do, but it's something that I'm willing to do because I want my family.\"",
      "She continued: \"Obviously, he knows it's the drink. He's not drank now for what, four months?",
      "\"I don't think the drink's gone away forever. Do I think that drink could still be a problem for us, potentially? Yeah, but I think the break-up showed Tommy that I'm serious.\"",
      "\"He's just really different these days.\"",
      "The news comes several months after Hague and Fury were seen kissing at a New Year's Eve party.",
      "In January, Hague denied their break-up had been a \"publicity stunt\", adding that the situation was \"really complicated\".",
      "In the new episodes of her TV series, Hague also spoke about a recent family holiday with Fury and Bambi which Mae described as \"picture perfect\".",
      "\"Dubai was picture perfect, like it was just the best trip ever,\" she said. \"It just felt like everything I wanted it to be, and more. It was exactly what we needed.",
      "\"All the noise of everyone, just like it just switched off everyone's opinions. Nothing mattered. It was just like us in our bubble.\"",
      "She added: \"Things are looking so much better for us. I'm gonna start spending more time at Tommy's house, keeping things slow and not rushing anything.",
      "\"But, as always, I always say I don't know what the future holds. I don't think it's going to be a plain sailing future. I don't, that's just me being honest. I think we're still going to have bumps.",
      "\"The dream is still the same that, you know, we'll get to a place one day when we will all be happy in that house together and have more children, hopefully, and just have a really nice, happy life together. That's all I've ever wanted for us.",
      "\"I don't want to get too excited, but I'm getting glimmers of what I always wanted, which is, my family.",
      "\"I know that we have got something completely worth saving but you never know what's around the corner.\"",

    "summary": "After being dismissed as \"indie landfill\", many guitar bands are back with a vengeance after 20 years.",
    "story": [
      "\"I'm pretty sure we hung out in Brixton. Hopefully I didn't embarrass myself.\"",
      "Luke Pritchard, the eternally youthful lead singer of The Kooks, is reintroducing himself to fellow indie survivor and Hard-Fi frontman, Richard Archer.",
      "Both admit the 2000s, when they each sold millions of records, are a bit of a blur.",
      "\"But I think I'd remember if you'd done something odd,\" reassures Archer, all chiselled good looks and friendly bonhomie.",
      "\"It's weird, because we were all part of the same scene but, when you're on tour, everyone's like planets, orbiting around but missing each other.\"",
      "The Kooks and The 'Fi were at the epicentre of the last great indie boom \u2013 a scene that kicked off in 2002 when The Libertines jolted British guitar music out of its post-Britpop slump.",
      "Over the next half-decade, they joined acts like Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs and Razorlight as they surfed a wave to the top of the charts.",
      "Angular riffs, clever-clever lyrics and big, hooky choruses were the order of the day.",
      "By 2006, seven of the UK's 10 best-selling new albums were by guitar bands, including the Arctic Monkeys' incendiary debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and The Kooks' Inside In/Inside Out.",
      "But the party couldn't last forever.",
      "In 2008, The Word magazine coined the phrase \"indie landfill\" to describe a seemingly endless parade of identikit bloke-bands cluttering the airwaves.",
      "Where were they all coming from? Why couldn't you tell them apart? Why where they all called \"The Something\"?",
      "Almost overnight, radio stations ditched indie for a new generation of forward-thinking pop (Lady Gaga, Florence + The Machine) and club-centric hip-hop (Black Eyed Peas, Dizzee Rascal).",
      "\"It did suddenly seem that four boys in a band became very un-hip,\" says Archer.",
      "\"The opportunities dried up in England,\" agrees Pritchard. \"We were playing smaller venues and the vibe just wasn't exciting any more.\"",
      "\"It got to a point where we were just exhausted,\" Archer continues. \"It felt like we were screaming into the void. So we stopped and tried other things.\"",
      "In the 2010s, Hard-Fi's guitarist Ross Phillips retrained as a tiler, while Archer formed the short-lived blues band OffWorld.",
      "But when he streamed an acoustic set of Hard-Fi songs during Covid, the response was big enough to tempt the band back on stage. A one-off gig at London's Forum sold out in minutes.",
      "\"The response was just so warm. I was quite taken aback by it,\" says Archer.",
      "The show led to a full reunion. This summer, the band will release a 20th anniversary edition of their class-conscious, Mercury Prize-nominated debut, Stars of CCTV, while preparing a long-delayed fourth album.",
      "The Kooks, meanwhile, never went away, recording a clutch of more experimental albums that blended drum loops, pastoral pop and even Ethiopian jazz influences.",
      "But today, the band are bigger than ever after hits like Na\u00efve and Ooh La found a new audience on TikTok.",
      "Later this year, they will headline the O2 Arena for the first time, with18 to 24-year-olds making up 45% of the audience.",
      "How do they explain this sudden revival?",
      "\"We're at that point where teenagers start going back to listen to the music their parents grew up with,\" Pritchard observes.",
      "\"In the 90s, we did it too, going back and discovering Nick Drake, so there's a circular nature to it. The scene, and even the fashion, has come around again.\"",
      "But there's something else, too. Songs like The Kooks' She Moves In Her Own Way and Hard-Fi's Hard To Beat have something that went missing in the 2010s - choruses you can sing until you're hoarse.",
      "\"Yeah, that anthemic thing was removed from guitar music,\" agrees Pritchard. \"People started consuming music on earbuds, so they connected with the introspective stuff.",
      "\"But when we were gathering a little fanbase in Brighton, we'd play all these small clubs and you'd filter the setlist by whether people could sing along to the hook.\"",
      "Archer recalls the grind of those early tours. In their first year, he reckons, Hard-Fi were on the road for \"almost 365 days\".",
      "But with one grassroots venue closing every fortnight in the UK, it's getting harder to book tours and road-test songs.",
      "\"What worries me is, if you're a new artist now, do you have the opportunity to go out there and make mistakes and fix them?\" says Archer.",
      "A shrinking live scene isn't the only upheaval in the industry.",
      "The Kooks' debut album sold 1.5 million copies in 2006 \u2013 making it the fifth biggest record of the year. Compare that with 2024, when the best-selling album in the UK (Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department) only sold 600,000 copies.",
      "Streams have cannibalised sales, turning every artist into a cult act. It doesn't help that opportunities for promoting music have dried up.",
      "The only music TV show left standing is Later... With Jools Holland, while weekly music magazines like the NME are no more - not that everyone laments its demise.",
      "\"We were never the best friends with the NME,\" laughs Archer.",
      "\"Who was?\" asks Pritchard. \"There were two or three anointed bands and the rest of us were cast out.\"",
      "Are there any reviews seared into their memories?",
      "\"No, I've done a lot of work on that,\" Pritchard jokes. \"But I definitely was more sensitive than I should have been.\"",
      "\"How can you not be, though?\" asks Archer. \"They're criticising something you've sweated blood and tears over.\"",
      "While compiling the anniversary edition of Stars of CCTV, he found an old clipping where a critic said the band's fans didn't understand real music.",
      "\"I kept it,\" he says, \"so I could get revenge later.\"",
      "\"You should frame it and put it in the loo,\" Pritchard suggests.",
      "\"Then I'd just be angry every time I have a dump.\"",
      "But the music press was powerful in the 2000s. Both frontmen recall feeling pressure to live up to the NME's ideal of a gobby frontman.",
      "Archer, a thoughtful and introspective character, was even provoked into saying he wanted to be the biggest star in the world.",
      "\"I don't see the point in being just another indie band,\" he boasted in one interview. \"What's the point of being parochial and small-time? I'm in competition with Eminem.\"",
      "\"You had to be super-confident and say provocative things,\" Pritchard reflects now.",
      "\"But what I learned is that a lot of songwriters are introspective, insular people - and when you throw them in front of a camera, it's quite challenging.\"",
      "With hindsight, both men emerged from the 2000s relatively unscathed, and share a newfound appreciation for their early records.",
      "Pritchard, in particular, is revisiting the breathless pop of The Kooks' first two albums on their new record Never/Know, released this week.",
      "\"I felt like I slightly lost my identity [because] I'd been collaborating with outside producers so much,\" he says.",
      "\"So I went back and played all the records we were listening to when we started -  not to repeat ourselves, but to get a firm hand on the identity again.\"",
      "The result is an album that's perfectly timed for summer road trips and sun-soaked festival sets, replete with buoyant melodies and timeless guitar grooves.",
      "Archer is in a similar place, with a new album inspired by a CD-Rom of old demos an ex-girlfriend sent to him last year.",
      "So, have the bands got a five-year plan?",
      "\"Definitely - but it's locked up in my safe,\" laughs Pritchard. \"I think it's good to have goals!\"",
      "\"Do you really?\" asks Archer, with a concerned frown.",
      "\"I literally don't know what I'm going to have for lunch.\""

      "Speaking to BBC News, Vikander, 36, said she was \"thrilled\" to be returning to the stage, but added it was a \"daunting thing to do... it's my first time on stage as an adult\".",
      "The production will play at London's Bridge Theatre for eight weeks from 10 September, organisers announced on Wednesday.",
      "\"I grew up being at the theatre a lot, my mother [Maria Fahl] was a stage actress, and I think even when I was dreaming of becoming an actress myself, being on stage was the journey that I kind of visualised,\" Vikander said.",

      "\"It's a daunting thing to do, obviously, it's my first time on stage as an adult, and it's on the London stage, and obviously I want to make sure people get their ticket money's worth! But I'm really excited.\""

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkg403x1gxo",
    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 11:14:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday, life followed fiction when 133 cardinals began the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave takes place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican knew the outcome until a plume of white smoke curled from its chimney on Thursday, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church had a new leader. That man was Cardinal Robert Prevost, now known as Pope Leo XIV.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave operates, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "What is behind the new Pope's chosen name, Leo?",
      "Who is Robert Prevost, the new Pope Leo XIV?",
      "Pope Leo XIV marks new beginning for Catholic Church",
      "What Pope's speedy election says about Church's priorities",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants would have been \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the most recent election was one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote had been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis' appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This added a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision of who would succeed Pope Francis.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

    "summary": "As Trump turns his attention to what he calls the \"dying\" US film industry, his solution has provoked strong reactions.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "He later said he would consult Hollywood executives to see if \"they're happy\" with his proposal, after the news sent shockwaves through the industry.",
      "So what might this mean for both the US film industry and the global movie business, including the UK?",
      "Is Hollywood 'dying'?",
      "Announcing the new tariffs, Trump declared that Hollywood was \"dying\". So is it?",
      "It's true that the industry has been through a really rough time in recent years.",
      "The pandemic saw production close down and the impact is ongoing.",
      "Hollywood studios spent $11.3 billion on productions in the second quarter of 2024, a 20% drop from the same period in 2022, as studios continued to cut costs in an attempt to recover from Covid losses.",
      "Any shoots of recovery were then severely stifled by the 2023 actors and writers strikes.",
      "Then the wildfires struck earlier this year.",
      "And for several years now, more and more people - not just youngsters - have been turning to YouTube and other streaming platforms for content.",
      "The US remains a major film production hub and according to Variety, 2025 has seen a rebound in box office numbers since last year, with overall domestic revenues up 15.8% on 2024 so far.",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "The latest Marvel superhero film, Thunderbolts*, topped the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million, marking a promising start to the summer season.",
      "But Hollywood is definitely still up against it.",
      "What is Trump proposing?",
      "The president says he wants to \"immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies made in America again!\"",
      "This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad.",
      "Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Hit franchises like Mission Impossible also shoot overseas.",
      "We also don't yet know if the tariffs will be applied retrospectively.",
      "Trump later told reporters that \"other nations have been stealing the movies and movie-making capabilities from the United States\", which may suggest he was only referring to non-US films.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC that \"no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made\", and added that the administration is \"exploring all options\".",
      "We will have to wait for more detail.",
      "What incentives do other countries offer?",
      "Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on.",
      "But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad.",
      "Some choose to do so for the specific location, exotic and exciting backdrops for example. Who could forget Tom Cruise's ascent of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol?",
      "What could it mean for the next James Bond movie, a franchise now owned by US giant Amazon, but based on an iconic British character who works for MI6, based in London?",
      "And it's not just other countries that offer incentives - other US states are luring film production away from Hollywood.",
      "Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky are among the many other US states which California are now competing with.",
      "Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who Trump described as \"grossly incompetent\" when speaking about the movie tariffs on Monday, is currently pushing for his plan to more than double the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually.",
      "While Newsom has made no comment yet on Trump's proposal, his senior communications advisor told Deadline: \"We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.\"",
      "How would any such tariffs actually work?",
      "There are more questions than answers at this stage.",
      "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a moratorium on tariffs for digital goods until 2026. Presumably films count as digital goods.",
      "And what would they base the tariffs on? Box office revenue or production costs? Is streaming content included? That would have a huge impact on US companies like Netflix. What about post-production ie editing?",
      "Tim Richards, Vue Entertainment CEO and founder, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"A big part of this is what constitutes US film - is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?\"",
      "And how do you even classify a foreign film when so many are co-productions and are often shot in several countries?",
      "Trump appeared to be talking about film and not TV but it's not 100% clear at this stage. Would tariffs apply to films made for streaming or just cinema releases? We'll have to wait for more detail. And of course, Trump may rollback on the proposals as he has done with some other tariffs.",
      "What could it mean for other countries?",
      "Obviously, putting a 100% tariff on foreign films means a huge cost increase for those production companies who want to sell to the US market.",
      "Commenting on Trump's announcement, the UK government's Culture Media and Sport Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: \"Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real.",
      "\"Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way.\"",
      "Head of media and entertainment trade union Bectu in the UK, Philippa Childs, said in a statement: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, questioned how the tariffs would work, pointing out that blockbusters like Barbie, which was distributed by US film studio Warner Bros Pictures, \"was actually shot virtually entirely in the UK\".",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" she told PA.",
      "The governments of Australia and New Zealand have also spoken out in support of their countries' film industries.",
      "\"Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,\" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said.",
      "New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs.",
      "\"But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,\" he added.",
      "And with the Cannes film festival just around the corner, uncertainty hangs in the air with many US film producers looking to sell foreign distribution rights.",
      "Could such tariffs work?",
      "Tariffs could incentivise US film companies to make more films on home soil but the risk is that if it's more expensive than to do so abroad, some films just won't get made.",
      "More incentives or rebates could help offset this but we just don't know at this stage if that's under discussion on a national scale.",
      "NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry.",
      "Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it \"harder for these films to make profits overseas\".",
      "\"It may create a situation where the tariffs in America are causing more harm than good,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "Just when you'd come to terms with the fact that Grand Theft Auto 6 had been delayed until next year, Rockstar Games goes and drops a brand new trailer.",
      "Last week, the video game developer announced the game had been pushed back to May 2026, shocking fans who were expecting it to land this autumn.",
      "It's been 12 years since the last GTA game was released, and the long wait for the most anticipated sequel of all time just became even more agonising.",
      "But earlier, the company released a new, three-minute trailer, giving eager players a stack of new information to dissect in the meantime.",
      "Here are some of the highlights.",
      "The record-breaking first trailer for GTA 6, published online in late 2023, introduced players to protagonists Jason and Lucia -  a couple who live a life of crime in Leonida, the fictional US state where the game is set.",
      "We now know a bit more about their backstory.",
      "The new trailer opens with Jason doing odd jobs before driving around Vice City - the Miami-inspired location from the 2002 PlayStation 2 game.",
      "According to Rockstar, Jason was a troubled teen who joined the army to escape his bad influences, but fell back into crime after returning home.",
      "In the trailer he eventually collects Lucia from prison, where she has been serving time for \"protecting her family\".",
      "From there, the clip launches into a montage of action sequences, romantic scenes and glimpses of the game's wider world.",
      "We see the couple carrying out armed heists, partying on a yacht and riding a jetski together.",
      "According to a description on Rockstar's website, the two want to forge a new life together but are plunged into \"the middle of a conspiracy\" after an \"easy score goes wrong\".",
      "New characters revealed",
      "Players also got to put names to faces of some of game's wider cast, including bank robber Raul Bautista, smuggler Brian Heder and rap combo Real Dimez.",
      "Like GTA 5, which was heavily based on Los Angeles and its surrounding areas, the sequel also appears to contain accurate recreations of some of Florida's most famous landmarks.",
      "Vice City's version of Miami's art deco, neon-lit beachfront appears in the trailer, as does the Grassrivers swampland, inspired by the Florida everglades.",
      "Rockstar also revealed the Leonida Keys, the industrial Ambrosia region, sleazy Port Gellhorn and the mountainous Kalaga National Park.",
      "In each case, it suggested the areas would be home to different groups and factions, from \"hillbilly mystics\" to biker gangs.",

      "More victims of the infected blood scandal will die without ever receiving full compensation, a government minister has said.",
      "The paymaster general Nick Thomas-Symonds was giving evidence to a special session of the public inquiry into what's been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history.",
      "It's thought 30,000 patients in the UK were infected with HIV or hepatitis B and C after being treated with a contaminated blood clotting product or given a blood transfusion in the 1970s and 80s.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds agreed it was \"profoundly unsatisfactory\" that just 106 final compensation awards have been paid, almost a year after a damning report into the scandal was published.",
      "What is the infected blood scandal?",
      "'Infected blood has ruined my life for 40 years'",
      "\"I'm never going to think this is satisfactory until everybody has received the compensation that is due,\" the Cabinet Office minister said.",
      "\"The objective should be absolutely to pay [people] as soon as possible.\"",
      "A final report into the scandal, published last year, found that the disaster could largely have been avoided if different decisions had been taken by the health authorities at the time.",
      "The report said too little was done to stop the importing of contaminated blood products from abroad in the 1970s and 80s, and there was evidence that elements of the scandal had been covered up.",
      "Last month the chair of the public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, ordered two days of extra hearings after he received \"letter after letter, email after email\" expressing concerns about the way the government's compensation scheme has been managed.",
      "The Chancellor Rachel Reeves set aside \u00a311.8bn in the last budget to make final awards to victims and their family members, but the latest figures show less than 1% of that total, some \u00a397m, has been paid out to date.",
      "Survivors of the scandal and some bereaved relatives have also received a series of smaller interim compensation payments over the last three years.",

      "\"They have lost all hope of ever getting justice and we can't be doing this for much longer.\"",

      "Gary Webster, a haemophiliac who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C when a pupil at Treloar's School in Hampshire in the 1970s and 80s, said that \"[some] people will not get their compensation and a lot of claims will die with them.\"",
      "\"It's just too slow and people won't get the justice they deserve,\" he added.",
      "Under the current rules, if someone infected with HIV or hepatitis B or C dies before receiving full compensation, then any final award can be passed on to their relatives through their estate.",
      "But compensation can also be claimed by those affected by the scandal \u2013 a partner, sibling or parent of a child, for example \u2013 for the separate impact on their lives.",
      "And if they die before that compensation is agreed, then their claim will die with them and cannot be passed on.",
      "In questioning later in the day, Mr Thomas-Symonds, who leads on the response for the government, said he was \"restless for further progress on payments\".",
      "The Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA), an independent body set up to pay victims of the scandal, has said it expects the \"bulk\" of awards to be made to infected survivors by the end of 2027, with most of those affected, such as family members and carers, paid by the end of 2029.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds said he regarded that timeline as a \"backstop\" rather than a target to work towards.",
      "\"The logic for that is there may be other people who have not yet come forward at this stage [to claim],\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A former health ombudsman has condemned mental health services for their handling of two vulnerable young men who died in their care.",
      "Sir Rob Behrens, who was parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO) from 2017 to 2024, spoke at the Lampard Inquiry, which is examining the deaths of more than 2,000 people under mental health services in Essex over a 24-year period.",
      "Sir Rob said it was \"a disgrace\" how Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) had failed in its care of 20-year-old Matthew Leahy, who died in 2012, and a 20-year-old man referred to as Mr R, who died in 2008.",
      "\"This was the National Health Service at its worst and needed calling out,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "'Near-complete failure'",
      "Sir Rob referred in his inquiry appearance to several reports made during his tenure, including \"Missed Opportunities\", which looked into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Mr Leahy and Mr R.",
      "Mr Leahy was found unresponsive at the Linden Centre in Chelmsford. He reported being raped there just days before he died.",
      "Sir Rob told the inquiry the PHSO identified \"19 instances of maladministration\" in Mr Leahy's case by North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust - a predecessor to EPUT - including that his care plan was falsified.",
      "The former ombudsman said there had been \"a near-complete failure of the leadership of this trust, certainly before it was merged\" with South Essex Partnership Trust to become EPUT.",
      "\"This was an indictment of the health service,\" he added.",
      "Sir Rob paid tribute to Matthew's mother, Melanie Leahy, who campaigned for more than a decade for a public inquiry, calling her \"an exemplary complainant\".",
      "\"She was very well prepared for every meeting, she was courteous but assertive. She knew what she wanted out of an investigation.",
      "\"Given the tragedy that she'd been through, it was a remarkable contribution to public life that she performed over many years,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "He also said that the way some doctors spoke about Mr R was \"staggering\".",
      "Mr R was found unresponsive in the Linden Centre in December 2008 and died afterwards. Sir Rob Behrens found he had been failed multiple times by those treating him.",
      "\"Some clinicians were interviewed after he died, and they had a very patronising approach to him\" he told the inquiry.",
      "\"In their view, [Mr R] didn't have mental health problems at all, and he had been admitted because he wanted somewhere to live because he was homeless. That is staggering.\"",
      "'No confidence'",
      "In a report called \"Broken Trust\", published in 2023, Sir Rob referenced there were more than a dozen different health and care regulators playing important roles in patient safety.",
      "\"Political leaders have created a confusing landscapes of organisations, often in knee-jerk reaction to patient safety crisis points,\" the report said.",
      "Sir Rob agreed with a suggestion put to him by Nicholas Griffin KC, chief counsel to the inquiry, that some incidents \"fall through the gaps\" due to the complexity of the complaints process and therefore are not investigated.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who simply don't know where to go,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "\"At the moment, I have no confidence that people trust the system because they don't know where to go when they want to make a complaint.\"",
      "Sir Rob said that Essex was \"not exceptional\" and the issues he had discovered there could be seen in other places as well.",
      "\"The absence of leadership\u2026 not communicating effectively with patients, the safety issues around ligature points\u2026 and the absence of training and development - these are still issues which the NHS has to address generally, not just in Essex,\" he said.",
      "The former ombudsman also told the inquiry that he was prevented from investigating a significant number of deaths\u00a0due to a \"serious limitation\" in his office's powers.",
      "Sir Rob Behrens explained the ombudsman could only investigate following a complaint, but that for understandable reasons of bereavement or trauma, many families in Essex did not complain following the deaths of loved ones.",

      "The \"big baby\" trial aimed to find out if starting labour earlier than 38 weeks made it less likely for infants who appeared large in the womb to be born with shoulder dystocia, where the shoulder becomes stuck during delivery.",
      "Study findings from between 2018 and 2022 showed giving birth a week to 10 days earlier reduced the risk, researchers said.",

      "Shoulder dystocia occurs in 1 in 150 vaginal deliveries, delaying birth and leading to possible complications, including a stretching in the nerves of the infant's neck.",
      "The NHS says the condition occurs more often in bigger babies but there is uncertainty over how often.",
      "It is estimated it could affect 1 in 25 women with a big baby who have a vaginal delivery.",

      "Prof Quenby said the trial findings empowered women to decide \"how and when they want to deliver their baby\".",
      "Trial data crucially revealed babies did not suffer more harm if they were delivered later. It also showed earlier delivery reduced the need for emergency Caesarean section and did not increase the risk of tearing.",
      "\"Whether you're induced at 38 weeks or whether you choose to wait for a natural labour, in both groups the baby's outcomes were the same,\" Prof Quenby said.",
      "\"Both groups had a risk of shoulder dystocia, it was actually slightly higher if you waited for labour naturally - but babies didn't do any worse if you wait for labour naturally.\"",

      "Finley, from Battlesbridge, Essex, underwent more than 20 operations at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London as doctors tried to understand his condition, and how best to treat it.",
      "His mum, Rhys, 37, said: \"It's heartbreaking at times - people don't see what Finley goes through day-to-day.",
      "\"They see the happy, chirpy young man, but psychologically he goes through a lot.\"",

      "\"He might not be able to eat it, but he's had the same normality in that respect as everybody else.\"",
      "Finley, who is also autistic, said the look and smell of food did not make him hungry or feel like he was missing out.",
      "\"Having my feed is all I know, so I just see other people eating and it doesn't bother me,\" he added.",
      "How does Finley eat?",
      "Finley receives a lipid infusion via a portacath, or tube, which enters his chest and links directly to the central vein in his heart.",
      "\"We have to bypass the gastro-intestinal tract completely,\" Dr Datta said.",
      "\"Not only the fat, but he even cannot tolerate the normal carbohydrates and proteins as well,\" he added.",
      "Finley receives carbohydrates and proteins - along with vitamins, minerals and electrolytes - three times a day into his stomach via a different tube.",
      "\"I can't remember when I had [the infusion] first because it's just my life now - I can't really escape it,\" Finley said.",
      "\"There isn't a name for what Finley has\" said Rhys, adding her son called his condition \"Finley-itis\".",
      "\"There's no-one else that we know that has the lipid element infused directly.\"",
      "\"We are actually thinking about reporting this case to some sort of journal because it's such a rare condition,\" Dr Datta said.",

      "When did authorities know about infected blood?",
      "By the mid-1970s, there were repeated warnings that imported US Factor VIII carried a greater risk of infection.",
      "However, attempts to make the UK more self-sufficient in blood products failed, so the NHS continued using foreign supplies.",
      "Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk.",
      "BBC News has also uncovered evidence children were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments - often, without their family's consent.",
      "As late as November 1983, the government insisted there was no \"conclusive proof\" that HIV could be transmitted in blood, a line robustly defended by former Conservative health minister Ken Clarke when he appeared before the inquiry.",

      "Care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas as part of a crackdown on visas for lower-skilled workers, the home secretary has told the BBC.",
      "Yvette Cooper said \"it is time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad\" and rules will change this year - instead requiring firms to hire domestically or extend visas of overseas workers already in the UK.",
      "The government plans to unveil a series of changes to visa and recruitment laws on Monday in a bid to cut net migration, and says measures will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers coming to the UK over the next year.",

      "Labour to unveil big immigration plans next week - but will they win back votes?",

      "Net migration climbed to a record 906,000 in June 2023, and last year it stood at 728,000.",
      "The Home Office has not yet officially confirmed what will be in its immigration White Paper, due early next week.",
      "But speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Cooper said changes to skilled and care worker visas \"will come in in the course of this year and those changes... we expect to lead to a reduction of up to 50,000 fewer lower-skilled visas over the course of the next year\".",
      "She added targets for net migration would not be set, saying \"they undermined the credibility of anything that governments do\".",
      "Philp told the same programme that the Conservatives would push for a Parliament vote on installing an annual cap on migration. When asked what the cap would be, he said \"we're working on the detail to specify that number\", but it would be \"a further reduction of significantly more than 50,000\".",
      "Cooper also said there would be \"some changes\" to rules around international students and graduates.",
      "\"We will let them continue to come and to stay and to work afterwards,\" she added.",
      "\"We are making some changes, particularly around the standards and the compliance for universities, because, again, we've had problems where some universities haven't had proper standards in place.",

      "Applications for Health and Care Worker visas peaked at 18,300 in August 2023, then collapsed to 1,700 by April this year following the ban on bringing dependants.",
      "And on 9 April, an additional restriction was added requiring care firms who want to recruit a new worker from overseas to prove they attempted to recruit a worker from within England first.",
      "But the new rules will now require care companies to recruit from domestic workers or a pool of over 10,000 care workers in the UK with cancelled sponsorships before hiring from abroad.",
      "Alongside this Cooper promised \"to bring in a new fair pay agreement for care workers\" to make care jobs more attractive to UK workers and reduce overseas demand.",

      "Yvette Cooper is getting ready to unveil the government's overhaul of the rules that determine who can come to the UK with permission, and for how long.",
      "Her White Paper, which will be called \"Restoring Control Over the Immigration System\" and be 69 pages long, is a big moment for Labour to try to sort a messy system, under which the numbers of people moving here rose way over most people's imagination.",
      "With Reform hard on Labour's heels, capitalising on public concern about immigration, the success or failure of Cooper is vital to the government.",
      "So what has Labour come up with?",
      "It will emerge in full on Monday, but we know a lot about what's on the table.",
      "It's expected that work visas will be strictly time-limited for jobs that don't need graduate-level skills.",
      "Foreign students who have studied for degrees here could lose the right to stay in the UK after they finish at university.",
      "Overseas workers will be expected to have a better understanding of English, but reported suggestions of A-level equivalent are wide off the mark.",
      "And companies who repeatedly can't show efforts to recruit UK-based staff, rather than hunt abroad, might lose their right to sponsor foreign workers to come here at all.",
      "There are also likely to be proposals designed to change how judges apply what's known as Article 8 of the Human Rights Act. It's designed to protect everyone's right to a family life.",
      "But how it's used sometimes by immigration lawyers to stop deportations has long been a concern of politicians \u2013 in 2011, I even remember Theresa May claiming an asylum seeker had been allowed to stay in the UK because of their cat.",
      "More than a decade later, recent cases like this one raised at Prime Minister's Questions have led the government to review how the courts have been interpreting everyone's right to a family life. We'll hear more of the details from the home secretary in the studio on Sunday, and likely from the prime minister on Monday.",
      "Some Conservatives and Reform argue the only way of making a material difference is to leave the European Convention on Human Rights altogether, rather than see ministers stick their nose into the courts. Whether the government's proposals here make a difference, we'll have to see.",
      "But the big principle in Cooper's thinking is that the immigration system should be fundamentally linked to the labour market \u2013 helping British workers get the skills to fill vacancies, rather than overseas workers being brought in again and again, to plug the gaps.",
      "The Whitehall wiring will be redirected to try to make that happen with a new approach under a 'quad' \u2013 where employers, the Department for Work and Pensions, the job centres, skills bodies, and the Migration Advisory Committee, that sets the specific rules, all work together.",
      "The idea, to wean the economy off relying on staff from overseas, by pushing employers to work much harder to find staff from here at home.",
      "That's the theory. Here are the politics: for years, conventional thinking in both main parties was the immigration was broadly good because it helped the economy. Politicians and members of the public who raised concern about the pace and scale of workers coming were sometimes dismissed.",
      "One Cabinet minister says last time Labour was in power, when \"people raised concerns, it was too easy to say it's a race question \u2013 there's a good understanding now that good, decent people worry about immigration \u2013 it's about fairness\".",

But Sir Keir Starmer's allies say he's been making the case for years, since a speech to the CBI in 2022, warning employers they wouldn't be able to rely on cheap foreign labour on his watch.",
      "Since then, partly down to the Conservatives' tightening up of visa rules before they left office, the numbers of people coming to the UK legally has dropped a lot and is expected to fall further this year. But the political prominence of the issue overall has gone the other way.",
      "By some polling measures in spring this year, immigration and small boats passed the NHS as the biggest worry for voters in 2025.",
      "If the numbers of workers coming is falling, why is the public more concerned?",
      "Sources inside government acknowledge that for many of the public, the issues of legal and illegal migration are bundled together.",
      "While legal migration has been falling, the numbers of those coming in ways considered illegal and trying to claim asylum has gone the other way, hitting the highest level since 1979.",
      "And there are two highly visible signs of that \u2013 small boat crossings, and asylum seekers being housed in hotels around the country.",
      "One member of the government told me: \"It's the boats, and everything is amplified on social media, we know it's having an effect as it's fed back to us on the doorstep \u2013 as a party we just seem to be floundering.\"",
      "The use of hotels isn't just costly \u2013 projected recently to be \u00a315bn, triple the amount the Conservatives reckoned when they signed the contracts back in 2019 \u2013 they can also create unease and resentment in communities.",
      "A Labour MP with an asylum hotel in their constituency tells me a big part of the problem is that constituents link spending on hotels with the government squeezing cash elsewhere.",
      "\"It is impossible to make the case we need to do some form of austerity while we are spending so much money on putting people up here \u2013 whether it's winter fuel and PIP (welfare payments) \u2013 you haven't got money for this, but you have money for that.\"",
      "There's even a belief in Downing Street that had there not been an asylum hotel in Runcorn, Labour would likely have held on to its seat in the by-election last week.",
      "The other blindingly obvious reason immigration has become so fraught politically is that for decades, successive governments have told the public one thing but done another. Under Tony Blair, people from countries joining the EU were allowed immediately to come and work in the UK.",
      "The government had publicly estimated the numbers likely to move would be around 13,000, but hundreds of thousands of people from Eastern Europe made the UK their home in the following years. Papers released at the end of last year reveal that some of Blair's team worried precisely about that happening.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has said that the outcome of talks between Ukraine's allies in Kyiv marks a \"significant moment\" in the push to secure a ceasefire in its conflict with Russia - but admitted it was not \"the end of the process\".",
      "Speaking to the BBC in Kyiv following a virtual meeting of the \"coalition of the willing\", the UK prime minister said \"we haven't seen unity like this pretty well throughout the conflict\".",
      "Around 30 global leaders reasserted their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire from Monday, threatening \"massive\" sanctions if it does not comply.",
      "Noting other conflicts including India-Pakistan hostilities, Sir Keir said \"we are living in a more uncertain world\" that \"requires leadership stepping up\".",
      "The UK prime minister joined French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk for the meeting, which was hosted by Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelensky.",
      "Other members of the \"coalition of the willing\" participated remotely, including Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Canadian PM Mark Carney, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, and Mark Rutte, the secretary-general of Nato.",
      "In a phone call with Donald Trump following the meeting, the US president reportedly reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire, after Vladimir Putin rejected his initial proposal in March.",
      "Sir Keir said Trump was \"absolutely clear that this is a demand that must be met\".",
      "The leaders assembled in Kyiv warned that \"new and massive\" sanctions will be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire \"in the air, at sea and on land\".",
      "Sir Keir told the BBC that \"material progress\" had been made during the meeting.",
      "\"We've been able to collectively get to a much better position and a more unified position today that holds out a better prospect of a ceasefire,\" he said.",
      "\"You've got unity in the demand, but also unity in what the response will be if the demand is not met. We haven't seen that sort of unity during this conflict.\"",
      "\"I'm not going to pretend this is the end of the process but this is a significant moment we now need to push on and make sure this happens,\" he added.",
      "Further coordinating sanctions on Russian oil, fossil fuels and other assets would make a \"material difference\", the prime minister said.",
      "The Kremlin reacted to the proposal by accusing European leaders of making \"contradictory\" and \"generally confrontational\" remarks about Russia.",
      "Press secretary Dmitry Peskov said that Ukraine's allies must stop sending weapons to Ukraine before any ceasefire can happen - something European leaders have rejected - before later saying Russia would consider the proposal.",
      "\"We have to think about this. This is a new development,\" state-run Russian news agency Tass reported Peskov as saying.",

      "\"It was a hugely important, symbolic day here in Kyiv because there was a propaganda exercise in Moscow yesterday,\" Sir Keir told the BBC.",
      "\"80 years on from VE Day it was really important that we were here today... to demonstrate that the values that underpinned what was being fought for 80 years ago are the same values now\".",
      "Asked whether he feels \"scared about the state of the world\" as others in Britain do - given conflicts in the Middle East and India-Pakistan tensions - Sir Keir said \"we are living in a more uncertain world and we're in a different era of defence and security\".",
      "But he said it did not keep him up at night \"because it's really important that I focus on what I can do - bringing people together, making significant steps today, making sure we're preparing with Ukraine for what might happen next\".",

      "The government's efforts to fix the prison crisis may not work without \"bold investment decisions\", the leading union for the probation service has said.",
      "Ian Lawrence, general secretary of Napo, said a review of sentencing policy by former Conservative Justice Secretary David Gauke \"may come to little effect\" if the probation service was underfunded.",
      "The union boss said he supported proposals to scrap short sentences for some offenders and toughen up community orders supervised by probation officers.",
      "But he said probation staff were already \"overworked\" and suggested any \"cost cutting\" could increase pressure on the service.",

      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said a \"crisis\" in the justice system had \"put a huge strain on the probation service\".",
      "\"We are hiring 1,300 new probation officers, investing in technology to cut back on admin, and increasing focus on those offenders who pose the greatest risk to the public,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"This will ease pressure on the service, help cut reoffending and keep our streets safe.\"",
      "Gauke is understood to be considering recommending the idea of scrapping short prison terms as part of the sentencing review.",

      "The money allocated to government departments for the three years beyond 2025-26 will be set out in the spending review in June.",
      "Lawrence said a reduction in funding for the Ministry of Justice, which oversees the probation service, could mean less funding to support offenders in the community and worse outcomes.",
      "\"In other words, they go out of prison and they've got no option but to commit crime because they have no means of supporting themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"They're back in prison within weeks. And so it goes on and that costs the taxpayer millions.\"",

      "Lawrence said Napo was in dispute with the prison and probation service over pay progression and workloads.",
      "He said the union had submitted a claim for a 12% pay rise for probation staff this year.",
      "That's way above the increases independent pay review bodies have advised the government to give teachers (4%) and NHS workers (3%).",
      "Lawrence said probation workers going on strike was a possibility if the pay offer was too low.",
      "\"We think senior leaders in [the service] have a responsibility to let ministers know the gravity of the situation,\" he said.",

      "But a similar shift could not be seen in other large British cities, he added, where spending in bars was more likely to shift into the weekend.",
      "He also added that a decline in city-centre spending had not been matched by a similar increase for high streets outside urban centres.",

      "Mr Swinney, director of the Centre for Cities think tank, was among various experts giving evidence to a special House of Lords committee set up earlier this year to examine the impact of remote and hybrid working in the UK.",
      "Last month, the think tank published research on the pre and post-pandemic spending patterns of city-centre workers in pubs and bars around their places of work, by comparing credit and debit card data from 2019 and 2024.",
      "The analysis showed that during that period, the share of weekly spending in pubs in central London on Fridays fell, whilst on Thursdays it rose, making it the most most popular night of the week.",
      "But a similar pattern was not seen in the data for nine other large British cities, including Glasgow, Liverpool, Bristol, Newcastle and Sheffield.",
      "Surveys have shown Friday has become the most popular day for office workers to work from home, with attendance during the middle of the week returning to more similar levels to before the Covid pandemic.",
      "'Shift to weekend'",
      "Explaining the spending data to peers on Thursday, Mr Swinney said that in London \"the Friday night drink hasn't so much gone away, it's just shifted to a Thursday\".",
      "\"But when we looked at other large cities, that wasn't the case,\" he added.",
      "\"It appeared from the data that we have that the post-work drink has reduced in those other places.",

      "He added that suburban supermarkets had \"probably been the biggest winner\" from the shift in spending patterns since Covid.",
      "He said more flexible working patterns had led to some immediate benefits for workers, including reduced travel cost and more flexibility.",

      "He said given Swinney's position on the issue in the past, he thought he was \"unlikely\" to win his support.",
      "McArthur added: \"Nevertheless, I would like to thank [the first minister] for his considered approach, the time he has taken to discuss the issue with me and his recognition that in this vote he does not speak for his party but solely on a personal basis.\"",

      "More than 30 companies, including Microsoft and Google, will meet the government today to explore how technology could help monitor offenders in the community more effectively and tackle violence in prison.",
      "Lord Timpson says tagging more people instead of sending them to prison is a potential alternative punishment.",
      "But critics have questioned his previous comments about the UK being \"addicted\" to sentencing and punishment, and how \"only a third\" of inmates should be in prison.",
      "\"I don't think I'm soft on crime at all,\" Lord Timpson says in the wide-ranging BBC interview. \"I think I'm pretty tough in my style. In business, I'm tough but I use the evidence - and in this job I'm using the evidence.\"",
      "He says he is passionate about rehabilitating offenders in prison so they don't commit further crimes when released. However, 38.3% of adult criminals in England and Wales go on to reoffend within a year of being let out of prison.",
      "\"How do we reduce re-offending? How do we deal with people's drug addiction, mental health problems, the fact that people leave prison they don't know where to live, people don't have a job? That is also a really important part of my job,\" he says.",
      "How many people are in prison and who is being released early from jail?",
      "The former CEO of the Timpson Group, which provides key cutting and shoe repair services, is known for hiring ex-offenders and is a former chairman of the Prison Reform Trust.",
      "Lord Timpson took up his role at the Ministry of Justice in July last year, when the penal system in England and Wales was close to breaking point. Prisons were full, and months later thousands of inmates were released early as part of an emergency plan to ease overcrowding and free up space.",
      "He says prisons are still in a state of \"crisis\", with fewer than 1,000 spare places and more than 88,000 people in custody in England and Wales.",
      "\"We recently opened HMP Millsike,\" he says, describing the new category C prison which opened in East Yorkshire in March, with capacity for up to 1,500 inmates. \"We've got more cells opening across the country. We need to keep building prison places because the population is going up.\"",
      "Last month, three prison officers were seriously injured at HMP Frankland, in Durham, after they were attacked with makeshift weapons and hot oil by one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing. Hashem Abedi was being held in a separation centre - used to house a small number of the most dangerous and extremist inmates - at the category A, maximum security jail.",
      "\"What happened in Frankland is absolutely shocking,\" Lord Timpson says. \"The level of violence in prisons is far too high - and it is increasing.",
      "\"Our prison staff did an incredible job. I don't want them to turn up to work thinking that there's going to be violence. I want them to turn up to work helping people turn their lives around.\"",

      "Lord Timpson refutes claims that gangs are in charge of some of Britain's biggest jails, but acknowledges that serious organised crime is the one thing that \"keeps me awake at night\".",
      "\"Serious organised crime brings drugs in and creates violence and intimidation in prisons,\" he says. \"This has been a long-term problem in prisons, but it is even more of a problem when the capacity is as full as it is.",
      "\"If we had people who went to prison who didn't get drugs and weren't intimidated by serious organised criminals, they'd be far more likely to engage with a sentence and get well enough so that when they leave they don't commit further crime.\"",
      "Why Starmer hired key-cutting boss as prisons minister",
      "The government has commissioned an independent sentencing review to explore alternatives to prison in an attempt to ease overcrowding. The review will provide long-term solutions for the justice system and examine the use and composition of non-custodial sentences, including community alternatives to prison and the use of fines. Increased tagging will also be considered.",
      "The total number of people fitted with an electronic monitoring device in England and Wales on 30 June 2024 was 20,893, an increase of 17% on the previous year.",
      "There are three types of ankle tags currently used to monitor offenders: alcohol, GPS, and curfew tags. A new study suggests tags that monitor curfews cut reoffending by 20%.",
      "\"We want them to have a one-way ticket - not a return back into prison or back into non-custodial sentences,\" Lord Timpson says.",
      "\"What's really important is we embrace technology and look at the evidence - tagging can have some very important benefits.\"",
      "But the use of electronic tagging to monitor offenders has been problematic. In recent months several probation staff have told the BBC offenders who should be tagged, have not been. The security company Serco has been contracted by the government to manage tagging since October 2023.",
      "\"We inherited a contract with Serco and it's been far from perfect,\" Lord Timpson says. \"We're putting a lot of pressure still on them to perform, but we need to work together to make sure that people are tagged on time in the right way. Things are getting better, but we're not there yet.\"",
      "Anthony Kirby, Serco Group CEO, told the BBC he is pleased the prisons minister has recognised the progress Serco has made since taking over the electronic monitoring service: \"We are proud of the role we have supporting the Criminal Justice System, monitoring record numbers of people in the community and protecting public safety in partnership with HMPPS.\"",

    "story": [
      "You have to go back more than 100 years, to before 1922, for an election where Labour was not dominating Welsh politics.",
      "Rooted in the industrial heritage of the country which was once the home of the UK's first Labour MP, Keir Hardie, the party has beat all others in Wales in every major Westminster election ever since.",
      "Labour has always been the largest party in Cardiff Bay too, and has won every election for the Welsh Parliament.",
      "But for the first time, the outlook for Welsh Labour at the next Senedd election on May 7 2026 is much less clear.",
      "Led by Eluned Morgan, it faces a fight to hold on to the reins of the Welsh government, and the sway it has held over Welsh politics.",
      "How do you vote in the Senedd election?",
      "What's your Senedd constituency?",
      "What does the Senedd do?",
      "Polls have shown Labour neck and neck with two parties - the pro-independence Plaid Cymru, and Nigel Farage's Reform UK.",
      "But a survey published this week suggested Plaid Cymru was pulling ahead, with Labour falling behind Farage.",
      "Both Plaid and Reform are hoping they can leapfrog Labour and become the largest group in the Senedd, as are the Welsh Conservatives, who are polling behind the other three.",
      "A new voting system means the next Senedd could be split between about four parties of a similar size, raising questions about exactly how the next Welsh government could be brought together.",
      "A senior Tory has said a coalition in the next parliament is \"nailed on\", and there is talk among some about whether parties would need to share the top job of first minister.",
      "The Welsh Parliament, or Senedd Cymru, is what we now call the institution set up as the National Assembly in 1999.",
      "Whoever can command control of the parliament forms the Welsh government - the ministers which run the services Westminster decided to hand over to Cardiff Bay, including the NHS.",
      "While it has never won a majority, Labour has led every single government since 1999, with the assistance of Plaid and the Lib Dems.",
      "The potential for a shake-up in the Senedd is partly down to plans to expand the number of politicians there from 60 to 96 - the brainchild of former First Minister Mark Drakeford and former Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.",
      "As well as more politicians, the new parliament is likely to better reflect the proportion of votes won by each party - more so than the mixed system used up until now.",
      "This is important when it is considered against polls that suggest Welsh voters are divided.",
      "Two recent ones - from Survation and Beaufort Research - have put Labour ahead of Plaid and Reform but only just.",
      "But a poll by ITV Wales and Cardiff University conducted in late April placed Plaid on 30%, with Reform behind on 25% and Labour on 18% - a historic low. The Conservatives were placed at 13%, the Lib Dems 7% and the Greens 5%.",
      "All recent polling for Labour on Senedd voting intention is lower than how the party performed at the last general election, where it got 37% of the vote.",
      "Cardiff University politics expert Prof Richard Wyn Jones said the previous mixed proportional and first-past-the-post system helped Labour win around 50% of the seats in Wales with \"a third of the vote\".",
      "He said elections in both Wales and Scotland next year will be the \"most high-profile test for the Starmer administration\".",
      "\"It would be utterly seismic if they are not the largest party in Wales,\" he told BBC Wales.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones spoke before Tuesday's poll was published - as did everyone else in this article. He said Labour's chances of coming first should not be written off.",
      "\"But even if Labour is only barely ahead, that would be seismic because it would mean the Labour group in the Senedd is essentially not much bigger than the current Labour group in the Senedd, and the Senedd would be 36 seats bigger,\" he said.",
      "So, what could be behind it all?",
      "The post-pandemic period has been tough for Welsh Labour \u2013 plunged into crisis over the donation of \u00a3200,000 from a man convicted of illegally dumping waste to its now-former leader, Vaughan Gething.",
      "The row exposed splits within the Labour group of 30 MSs. Despite Welsh Labour having a landslide general election result, several Welsh ministers resigned to force Gething's ouster, prompting the rise of Morgan as first minister.",
      "Even before Drakeford decided to step down in late 2023, triggering the leadership contest that Gething won, Labour MSs had been arguing over transport policies, including the default 20mph speed limit, while the government has been struggling with long waits in the Welsh NHS.",
      "Former Labour special advisor turned lobbyist Cathy Owens, of Cavendish Cymru, partly blamed the leadership crisis and factors at a UK level.",
      "Or, as she puts it: \"As soon as Labour won power at UK level... everybody realised that Keir Starmer wasn't the most exciting leader we've had and then Labour had to make lots of difficult decisions.\"",
      "'We were lecturing over 20mph'",
      "NHS waits and the controversial 20mph speed limit were always among the top three issues relayed on the doorstep at the general election, according to a well-connected Welsh Labour activist.",
      "They said a mix of Welsh and UK issues were at play, but argued that the Welsh government \"got complacent\".",
      "The activist blamed the \"way\" the 20mph speed limit was delivered - \"it told voters we weren't listening to them and we were essentially lecturing them\".",
      "\"I agree with the desired outcomes of the policy, but you can't treat voters like that,\" they said.",
      "Alun Davies, Labour Blaenau Gwent MS, acknowledged the public was \"frustrated with politics\" but said: \"Labour remains the party that probably most people in Wales feel represents their own values.\"",
      "The politician, who is involved in the production of the party's manifesto, said: \"Eluned has got the power to transform Welsh Labour's fortunes during an election campaign.",
      "\"She is very straight-talking - what you see is what you get.\"",
      "Wales' Labour first minister says she will 'call out' Starmer",
      "Politics 'doesn't work' for many people in Wales",
      "Cathy Owens said the current first minister needed two things to get to 30% of the vote or more, \"one of which is to reduce waiting times\".",
      "For the second thing, Ms Owens said Morgan needed help from her party colleagues in the UK government - \"some funding, or some extra investment\" over and above what is automatically provided through the existing Barnett formula system, which is largely based on population.",
      "\"Now, that is proving more of a sticky wicket,\" she said. \"There has been no evidence of a win so far on that\".",
      "The relationship between Welsh and Westminster Labour has become a big part of the story of Morgan's time as Welsh Labour leader.",
      "She has been increasingly keen to distance herself from Sir Kier Starmer - on Tuesday she gave a speech where she was willing to call out his government, should it take decisions that \"harm\" Welsh communities.",
      "'The polls tell a good story'",
      "One party hoping to benefit from the turn in Labour's fortunes is Plaid Cymru.",
      "The left-leaning party has long struggled to beat its strong showing in the first assembly election of 1999 when it won almost 29% of the vote, but the splintering of British politics has presented Plaid with an opportunity.",
      "Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has been presenting himself as a first minister in waiting, while the party has published plans on health and the economy it said it would enact if it formed the next Welsh government.",
      "Unlike their political cousins in Scotland, the SNP, Plaid has never won a Welsh election and came third last time round.",
      "It took part in a short-lived coalition with Labour between 2007 and 2011, and helped Labour govern more recently in the form of the co-operation deal which ended in summer 2024.",
      "\"We're not getting too carried away with the polls,\" Plaid's Senedd party chairman Llyr Gruffydd said. \"But the polls do tell a good story for us.\"",
      "\"We will clearly be highlighting the need for change. It's a tired government.\"",
      "He said the party will face a challenge in helping \"people realise that this is a different electoral system. Every single vote counts - there will not be a wasted vote\".",
      "It was put to Gruffydd that it was difficult for Plaid to be seen as anti-establishment when it had been involved in helping Labour govern. \"We won't shy away from the fact that we've been punching above our weight... and still achieving elements of our manifesto,\" he said. \"Imagine what we could do if we were in government.\"",
      "'There's so much frustration'",
      "One party hoping to make their big entrance into Welsh politics is Farage's Reform UK.",
      "The party has polled closely to Labour and Plaid Cymru and came second in 13 seats at the last general election. While it has five MPs in England, and some councillors in Wales, it has no-one at Senedd at present.",
      "It is celebrating its recent English local election successes, where it made big gains, won control of 10 councils, two mayors and a by-election from Labour.",
      "Pointing to who the party is in Wales is difficult - it is yet to decide who will stand for them at the next election, or who might act as a figurehead.",
      "They are not starting from scratch - Farage's previous party UKIP had a short-lived stint in the Senedd after it won seven AMs in 2017.",
      "At least one of their former AMs is hoping to become a Reform MS - Caroline Jones. She is hoping to stand for Reform in the seat of Pen-y-bont Bro Morgannwg - which covers Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan.",
      "Opponents accuse Reform of simply being a protest party, something that would be denied by Jones. She told BBC Wales that another former UKIP Senedd politician, and one-time Tory MP and ex-Abolish the Assembly AM, Mark Reckless, was working with a team on policy for the Senedd.",
      "\"At the moment, there's so much frustration among the public - we are offering something different.\"",
      "Jones added: \"You have to have a party that's representative of the people, as opposed to just representing their own interests.\"",
      "UKIP's time in the Senedd was characterised by two changes in leadership, rows, and splits. At one point there were more UKIP AMs who had been leader than had not - including Jones herself.",
      "\"The Reform party is united,\" she said. \"There are hardly any arguments at all, and anything that people disagree on.\"",
      "Other parties may try to capitalise on Farage's relationship with the controversial US president Donald Trump to galvanise opposition to Reform.",
      "Jones said that was not a negative: \"If we've got special links with America, then I think it's to be capitalised on.\"",
      "Asked if she thought the party needed a Welsh figurehead, she said: \"That's above my pay grade.\"",
      "'This is what we're for'",
      "The Conservatives have a relatively new leader in the Senedd - Darren Millar, who took over late last year after a row over the leadership of Andrew RT Davies.",
      "Under Millar the party has tried to present itself as a serious alternative to Labour, with the Senedd leader keen to show he can be the next first minister and not simply an opposition force.",
      "But the Tories are still in the shadow of a disastrous general election, where the party went from having won 14 seats in the 2019 vote to zero. Recently it has been polling in fourth place. It came second in the Senedd election in 2021.",
      "Samuel Kurtz, chairman of the Tory group in the Senedd, said he was excited by the prospect of the election and the \"opportunities of a different political landscape come 8 May 2026\".",
      "The MS for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire said: \"We need to put forward a positive vision for what Wales could look like. We have had 25 years of the same party in charge, the same government, and a tried and tested method of pretty much trying the same thing.",
      "\"It's saying, look, this is what we're for. We're for a stronger economy, we're for the ability for families to have choice over certain things like education, we're for agriculture, we're for tourism.\"",
      "He added: \"What we've really done with Darren is really hunker down as to what is our USP as Welsh Conservatives, what are we for... rather than just saying we are against the 20mph speed limit for example, or we're against the tourism tax.\"",
      "Asked why he thought the Welsh Conservatives were struggling in polls, former Senedd Tory adviser Anthony Pickles said: \"Because the national party is still so involved in trying to work out its future strategy, its very difficult for the Welsh Conservatives to be diverging, and creating their own brand proposition\".",
      "Smaller parties are thought to be at a disadvantage in the new system - with experts suggesting parties need 13% to 15% to win seats.",
      "That is not to say they won't try - with the Greens among those who will be hoping to enter the Welsh Parliament for the first time.",
      "The Liberal Democrats, who won one regional seat at the last Senedd election and one at the last general election, are hoping to win more.",
      "Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds previously told the BBC: \"We'll have gold everywhere. Look at what we did in England [at the last general election].",
      "\"No-one thought we would win 72 seats. The results were coming in fast and furious that night and I reckon it is going to be like that next May as well.\"",
      "Who could work with who?",
      "It is early days, but the prospect of the electorate being split four ways or more raises questions about how the next government could be formed.",
      "Politicians can be reluctant to talk about the topic with 12 months to go, but for Labour, you would assume a deal with the Conservatives or Reform would be unthinkable. Ministers have instead worked with Plaid and the Lib Dems in the past.",
      "Plaid have ruled out working with Reform, but not Labour or the Tories.",
      "The Conservative's Kurtz declined to talk about who the party might work with, but said the likelihood of a coalition is \"nailed on - it'll have to be a coalition. No one party will reach the threshold of governing on their own\".",
      "Plaid's Gruffydd said a rotating first ministership - similar to how the coalition running the Irish government has operated with rotating prime ministers - \"could be on the agenda\".",
      "\"It depends on the arithmetic,\" he said, suggesting it could be discussed if there are \"two parties thoroughly at the same kind of level\".",
      "But Ms Owens said if Labour held at 27% as in some recent polls, you are \"more likely to have a Labour first minister\", with the party a few seats or more ahead of Plaid.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones also argued the upheaval in geopolitics could play a role.",
      "It could not be predicted, he argued, whether something happening worldwide could make people feel more positive about Labour.",
      "The expert added: \"This is such a hugely uncertain time that everything that we are saying needs to be caveated.\""

      "The anger among Labour MPs in the aftermath of the party's local elections drubbing was striking in its breadth and depth. The evidence so far is that it did not dissipate over the long weekend.",
      "The focus of many MPs' rage - and it is rage - is the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance.",
      "It is not just the view of critical MPs that this harmed Labour in the elections, but of cabinet ministers too.",
      "Earlier Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Breakfast: \"I'm not going to insult your viewers by pretending that winter fuel didn't come up on the doorstep, of course it did, and I know that people aren't happy about winter fuel allowance in lots of cases.\"",
      "Government sources spent Tuesday morning scotching the suggestion that a formal review of the policy is under way, and by the afternoon they were adamant.",

      "That will be a disappointment to those Labour MPs who believed that reversing the policy on winter fuel would be the clearest sign to the public that the prime minister, as he said on Friday morning, \"gets it\".",
      "Others closer to government thinking questioned whether there would be any political benefit to changing course at this stage, believing the damage has been done.",

      "\"When people were complaining about winter fuel on the doorstep you'd look at the [canvassing] sheet and often it's people who have never voted for us or haven't voted for us for a long time. With Pip, they were our people.\"",

      "Questions about the party's strategic direction will be paramount. Though the principal beneficiary of Thursday's local elections at Labour's expense was Reform UK, there are plenty in Labour who worry just as much about bleeding votes on their left flank to more progressive parties such as the Greens.",
      "Many are noting that in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election the Conservative vote more than halved, at least partly due to defections to Labour to stop Reform. Meanwhile, the Green vote actually nudged upwards.",
      "\"We couldn't squeeze the progressive vote - and we'll need to do that at the general election,\" one government source said.",

      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",
      "Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first past the post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.",
      "The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.",
      "That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.",
      "Brexit still a fault line",
      "Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.",
      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Romney Marsh in Kent and Chadsmoor in Staffordshire.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",
      "However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.",

    "summary": "A powerful prime minister tries and fails to stop an Old Labour stalwart's progress to City Hall.",
    "story": [
      "Regional mayors are now commonplace in England: Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, Ben Houchen in the Tees Valley and Tracy Brabin in West Yorkshire are all well-known spokespeople for their areas.",
      "But the most prominent directly-elected mayor in Britain was also the first: London.",
      "As is fitting for a city as exciting as London, the first election for that coveted position included allegations of betrayal, stitch ups and intrigue \u2013 and one candidate ended up in prison.",
      "Twenty five years ago Tony Blair's government, elected in 1997 and known as New Labour, was very keen on a new form of devolution.",
      "They wanted mayors like those in America, big personalities elected with powers and budgets (but not too many powers, or too big a budget).",
      "In the end, only one was created by Blair's government.",
      "The 1998 Greater London Authority referendum, held in May that year, asked whether there was support for creating a Greater London Authority with a directly elected mayor and Assembly.",
      "The voters were less keen than New Labour - just 34% turned out to vote, but the majority was clear nonetheless: 72% in favour.",
      "The 'Yes' vote won in every London borough, with support lowest in Bromley with 57% and highest in Haringey with 84%.",
      "Now London was to have a mayor, who would it be?",
      "The obvious candidate was Ken Livingstone, the former left-wing firebrand (and publicity-friendly) leader of the Greater London Council (GLC), who went toe-to-toe with the Thatcher government - and lost.",
      "The GLC was abolished in 1986, leaving London in the unenviable position of having 32 boroughs (and the City of London) but no overall strategic elected body for the largest city in Europe.",
      "However, Livingstone's ability to alienate prime ministers wasn't confined to Conservatives.",
      "Tony Blair was also not a Ken fan.",
      "\"Red\" Ken, as he was known, was Old Labour, not New Labour.",
      "The message from Downing St was clear: Stop Ken.",
      "The party management tried to get the very popular Mo Mowlam to stand, then switched to Frank Dobson.",
      "A bearded, avuncular figure who was serving as New Labour's first health secretary, he was 'persuaded' to stand against his old comrade Ken.",
      "Dobson had initially, and somewhat bravely, declared his desire to remain at health, but then had to give up his cabinet seat to run for a job he didn't want.",
      "The internal workings of Labour can be difficult for outsiders - and many insiders - to navigate.",
      "In this case, an electoral college was mandated which led to the popular Livingstone not winning selection.",
      "The vote was a third each for party members, trade unions and London MPs and other elected representatives.",
      "In the final ballot Livingstone won 60% of party members and 72% of affiliated unions, but Dobson won 86% of MPs, MEPs and Greater London Assembly candidates.",
      "Dobson therefore won a narrow overall victory, and the Blairites were accused of rigging the whole thing to keep Old Labour Ken from the nomination.",
      "Livingstone for his part had promised not to run as an independent, then decided that that was what he was going to do after all.",
      "The Tories also had a colourful time choosing their candidate.",
      "In September 1999 the novelist Jeffrey Archer was selected by party members, beating Steve Norris.",
      "But in a plot twist reminiscent of one of his books, Archer withdrew from the race a few months later after it was alleged he had committed perjury in a famous libel case.",
      "Lord Archer had secured the Conservative nomination with backing from former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, who in 1992 had made him a peer.",
      "Five years earlier, in 1987, Archer had won a libel case against The Daily Star which published a story that he had paid off a sex worker called Monica Coghlan.",
      "After his selection as a mayoral candidate, a former friend of Archer's told the News of the World that he had lied in the libel trial and asked him to provide a false alibi.",
      "Archer stood down from the race, and starred in a production of his courtroom play, The Accused, in London's West End while waiting for his trial to start.",
      "In July 2001 he was found guilty and spent two years in jail, but retained his peerage and membership of the House of Lords as there was no mechanism to remove them at the time.",
      "Norris was selected as the Conservative Party candidate to replace Archer.",
      "A very different type of Tory, Norris advocated for gay rights and had a relaxed approach to monogamy.",
      "He was also a former transport minister who was obsessed with buses.",
      "In that role, he had a hand in approving the Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford, and the privatisation of London's bus services.",
      "In the rough and tumble world of turn of the century politics, he was given the nickname \"Shagger\".",
      "A brief snippet from a Guardian profile piece published during that first mayoral campaign gives a flavour of Norris' complex appeal.",
      "\"The day his original candidature was announced was marked by a letter to the Times from his father-in-law, a retired rear-admiral, expressing astonishment at Norris's public plans to marry the fourth of his famous five mistresses \u2026 since as far as the rear-admiral knew, Norris was still married to his daughter.\"",
      "Norris was a self-made man, a millionaire car salesman who grew up in working class Liverpool, attending the same school as Paul McCartney.",
      "Not many 2025 Tories can boast that sort of hinterland.",
      "There may have been some intrigue in the Lib Dem selection process, but it is lost to history if there was.",
      "Their candidate was the estimable Susan Kramer, who was subjected to condescension and mansplaining throughout the campaign - this was a time when female Labour MPs were referred to as \"Blair's Babes\" by tabloid and broadsheet newspapers alike.",
      "Livingstone was to mount the first - and so far only - successful independent bid for Mayor of London.",
      "Dobson ran a campaign that never really captured the imagination of London's voters, and his old comrade won the historic poll despite a late surge in support for the Tory candidate.",
      "The May 2000 election was a disaster for New Labour: Dobson got just 13% of the vote and was eliminated in the first round along with Susan Kramer, who polled a respectable 11.9% for the Lib Dems.",
      "Livingstone led by 39% to 27% of first preference votes and polled a total of 776,427 votes to 564,137 for Norris, after second preferences were calculated.",
      "It was a bloody nose and a notable defeat for the previously unassailable Tony Blair.",
      "The BBC News website has an archive of reports from this election, a time capsule of the way politics used to be.",
      "It reported that Dobson's \"humiliation in the mayoral poll was underlined as he came fourth in the mayoral contest in Barnet and Camden - the seat which includes his parliamentary constituency\".",
      "The 2000 election reports reveal Livingstone said he would \"fight for the interests of Londoners as mayor, demanding more money from the government and telling ministers they were wrong over plans to partially privatise the London Underground\".",
      "London Underground, now part of Transport for London, remains in public hands under the control of the Mayor of London.",
      "It also reported that Blair \"made it clear Mr Livingstone would not be allowed to return to Labour after standing against an official party candidate\".",
      "Blair was wrong about that: in 2004 Livingstone was the Labour candidate, and he won, again defeating Norris.",
      "Livingstone was his party's standard bearer again in both 2008 and 2012, on both occasions losing to a young Conservative contender called Boris Johnson.",

      "The tiny grains of dust are now locked inside a safe in a high security facility in Milton Keynes - we were given the first look at them.",
      "Professor Mahesh Anand is the only scientist in the UK to have been loaned this extremely rare material, which he describes as \"more precious than gold dust\".",
      "\"Nobody in the world had access to China's samples, so this is a great honour and a huge privilege,\" he says.",
      "After grinding and zapping the dust with lasers, Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth.",
      "Inside the grains of dust could be evidence to back up scientists' theory that the Moon was made from the debris thrown out when Earth struck a Mars-sized planet 4.5 billion years ago.",
      "China collected the rocks on its Chang'e 5 space mission in 2020 when it landed on a volcanic area called Mons R\u00fcmker.",
      "A robotic arm drilled into the soil to collect 2kg of material, which was brought back to Earth in a capsule which landed in Inner Mongolia.",
      "It was the first successful lunar sampling since a Soviet mission in 1976 and catapulted China into a leading position in the new space race.",
      "Now, following a long tradition of global collaboration between space scientists, China has for the first time granted seven international researchers access to the samples to allow them to make new discoveries.",
      "The tiny vials were handed to Prof Anand at a glamorous ceremony in Beijing last week, where he met colleagues from Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Europe.",

      "The environment inside this high security room must be spotless to prevent contamination.",

      "We crouch down on the floor in front of a row of safes. Prof Anand unlocks one and carefully pulls out a ziplock bag with three containers the size of boxes that could keep a necklace.",
      "Wedged firmly in each one is a see-through vial with a dusting of dark grey at the bottom.",
      "That is the Moon dust.",
      "It looks underwhelming, but it is humbling to think of its cosmic journey.",
      "And Prof Anand says they don't need any more than this 60mg in total.",
      "\"Here, the small is mighty. Believe me, it is enough to keep us busy for years to come because we specialise in working on the micro,\" he adds.",

      "\"But I'm nervous - there's not much of the samples and they can't really go and get more very easily. This is high stakes,\" she adds.",
      "After she prepares the samples, they will go into two more labs.",
      "In one, we see a machine with an intricate network of countless tubes, valves and wires.",
      "Technician Sasha Verchovsky has been building it since the early 1990s. He shows us the small cylinder where the specs of dust can be heated to 1400C. That will help them extract carbon, nitrogen and noble gases.",

      "\"It's going to start to glow, and you will see it melt inwards,\" he says.",
      "The team has a year to finish their research. By the end, their search for answers will probably end up destroying the samples.",
      "But China has gone further since the Chang'e 5 mission.",
      "In 2024 its Chang'e 6 launch brought back the first samples from the far side of the Moon. It's a deeply mysterious place that might have evidence of long-quiet volcanic lava flows.",
      "\"I very much hope that this is the beginning of a long-term collaboration between China and international scientists,\" says Prof Anand.",

      "'Heart-breaking'",
      "Fellow Splott resident Lynne Thomas, who organises monthly volunteer litter picks, said much of the litter was caused by people incorrectly putting their bins out.",
      "\"The seagulls are getting savvy - if there's any food elements in any of the bags they're there in seconds - they will have it, they will shred it and strew it across the streets,\" she said.",
      "\"If everyone uses the right caddies and bags then that's one step towards keeping the streets cleaner.\"",

      "She urged people to \"be proactive and help each other out\" by joining litter picks, and reporting dumped waste to the council.",
      "The illegal dumping of waste, known as fly-tipping, is also an issue in the area.",
      "\"[This] is obviously an illegal fly-tip of what looks like domestic waste,\" explained Gareth Davies from Keep Wales Tidy, in reference to a large pile of rubbish in a gully between the housing estate and a main road.",
      "\"Often this isn't local residents, but rather people fly-tipping in other people's communities,\" he said.",

      "\"Trying to find the money we need to provide these litter services is a real difficulty - we're all struggling with it,\" said Ms Burnett, who also represents the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA).",
      "The need for increased funding for education and social care had meant other budgets were being squeezed, she warned.",
      "\"It's a huge issue for every single local authority in Wales,\" she added.",

      "While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage.",
      "\"It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,\" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said.",
      "Kosmos 482's lander capsule was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it had a robust heat shield and durable structure.",
      "This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere.",
      "However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space.",
      "Mr Lemmens explained that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently\". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones.",
      "Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground.",
      "China's Long March 5B booster re-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and the Tiangong-1 space station mostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018.",
      "Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies.",
      "Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft \"should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries\".",
      "This would allow for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas and protecting people and property while \"managing the environmental impact of space debris\"."

    "published": "Tue, 06 May 2025 20:13:28 GMT",
    "summary": "Sir David says his new film Ocean is one of the most important of his career.",
    "story": [
      "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.",
      "He believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.",
      "Sir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"",
      "The ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.",
      "The blue carpet was rolled out for the premiere the Royal Festival Hall in London.",
      "In attendance was the King, told Sir David he \"can't believe\" his 99th birthday was on Thursday.",
      "The pair posed for photos before they entered the auditorium for the screening.",
      "A host of celebrities also attended, including singer Geri Halliwell-Horner, astronaut Tim Peake, singer James Blunt and model Cara Delevingne.",
      "Earlier, Prince William attended a matinee in a \"private capacity\", along with hundreds of children from schools across the country.",
      "Toby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.",
      "The film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.",
      "Sir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"",
      "Since then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.",
      "Ocean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.",
      "The new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.",
      "\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.",
      "The process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.",
      "Sir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".",
      "Sir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.",
      "It is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.",
      "Just one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"",
      "But in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.",
      "One of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"",
      "Despite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"",
      "Sir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.",
      "He believes that could be transformational.",
      "\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"",
      "A healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.",
      "\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.",
      "As he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.",

      "The Wikimedia Foundation - the non-profit which supports the online encyclopaedia - is seeking a judicial review of rules which could mean Wikipedia is subjected to the toughest duties required of websites under the act.",
      "Lead counsel Phil Bradley-Schmieg said it was \"unfortunate that we must now defend the privacy and safety of Wikipedia's volunteer editors from flawed legislation\".",
      "The government told the BBC it was committed to implementing the act but could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.",
      "It's thought this is the first judicial review to be brought against the new online safety laws - albeit a narrow part of them - but experts say it may not be the last.",
      "\"The Online Safety Act is vast in scope and incredibly complex,\" Ben Packer, a partner at law firm Linklaters, told the BBC.",
      "The law would inevitably have impacts on UK citizens' freedom of expression and other human rights, so as more of it comes into force \"we can expect that more challenges may be forthcoming\", he told the BBC.",
      "These will add to the array of challenges the act already faces, from claims its burdensome rules are forcing harmless small websites to close - to those who argue the law and its enforcement are too weak and not up to the job.",
      "Why is Wikipedia unhappy?",
      "The OSA requires the regulator, Ofcom, to categorise platforms according to a number of factors, including how many users they have and what features they offer.",
      "Those designated \"Category 1\" - the highest level - will face additional duties to keep users safe.",
      "In very simple terms, sites are most likely to be classed as Category 1 if they allow millions of UK users to interact and share content with each other, and have systems that recommend content.",
      "These rules were originally designed to target the services where UK users were most likely to encounter harmful content - but Wikipedia is concerned they are so vaguely defined there is \"a significant risk\" it will be included in Category 1.",
      "If that happened, the consequences for the army of volunteers who write and edit articles could be serious and would reach beyond the UK, the Foundation argues.",
      "It has singled out additional duties which could, in effect, require the site to verify the identities of its volunteers - something it fears could expose them to data breaches, stalking, vexatious lawsuits or even imprisonment by authoritarian regimes.",
      "\"We would be forced to collect data about our contributors, and that would compromise their privacy and safety, and what that means is that people would feel less safe as contributors\", Rebecca MacKinnon the Wikimedia Foundation's vice president of global advocacy told the BBC",
      "\"We've seen in other parts of the world, when people do not feel safe contributing to Wikipedia, then they shy away from controversial topics that may be challenging to to people who are powerful, and that reduces the quality and the usefulness of the encyclopaedia\".",
      "'Outlier' services",
      "The Wikimedia Foundation stresses it is not trying to challenge the OSA in general, or the idea that there should be Category 1 services subject to additional duties.",
      "Instead, it is challenging parts of the so-called \"Categorisation Regulations\" that set out how the regulator Ofcom will decide which sites will have to follow the most stringent duties.",
      "It argues, as currently defined, they risk not only inappropriately catching sites such as Wikipedia but also missing some platforms which should be abiding by tougher rules.",
      "\"The Regulations do not just risk overregulating low risk \"outlier\" services, like Wikipedia,\" Phil Bradley-Schmieg wrote in a blog post.",
      "\"As designed, the regulations will also fail to catch many of the services UK society is actually concerned about, like misogynistic hate websites\".",

    "story": [
      "Apple is asking an appeals court to pause a US district judge's recent ruling in a case which could determine the future of its highly lucrative App Store.",
      "Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found last week the tech giant wilfully violated an order she had previously made in a case filed by Fortnite-maker Epic Games.",
      "That order - handed down in 2021 - demanded Apple refrain from anti-competitive conduct and pricing and allow outside payment options in the App Store.",
      "Last week she determined Apple was flouting that demand - a finding Apple has now called \"extraordinary.\"",
      "The iPhone maker has alleged in a court filing that her order unlawfully prevents the company from controlling \"core aspects of its business operations.\"",
      "\"A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free access to its products and services, including intellectual property,\" the company's lawyers wrote.",
      "Case origins",
      "Both of Judge Gonzalez Rogers' judgements stem from an antitrust case filed by Epic Games.",
      "In 2020, Epic accused the iPhone-maker of possessing an illegal monopoly with its App Store, which collected commissions of between 15% and 30% on in-app purchases.",
      "The judge rejected Epic's monopoly claims, but found Apple was stopping developers from giving users alternative payment options in violation of California competition rules.",
      "She ordered Apple to make changes that would help developers steer customers to cheaper payment options outside of the Apple ecosystem.",
      "Last year, Epic accused Apple of failing to comply by creating a new set of fees for developers instead.",
      "In a contempt order last week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple continued to interfere with competition, saying that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her 2021 injunction.",
      "'Substantial sums'",
      "On Wednesday, Apple requested an appeals court take action, including by lifting a ban that stops it from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store.",
      "The company wrote that such restrictions \"will cost Apple substantial sums annually\" and are based on conduct that has not been found unlawful.",
      "\"Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law Injunction that is itself invalid,\" Apple wrote.",
      "In response, Epic Games said Judge Gonzalez Rogers' contempt order last week was already benefitting consumers.",
      "\"Apple has faced a surge of genuine competition as developers have updated their apps with better payment methods, better deals, and better consumer choice,\" Epic wrote in a post on the social media platform X.",
      "The company criticized Apple's motion as \"a last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.\"",
      "Epic says it is on track with plans to bring Fortnite back to iPhones and iPads.",
      "Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store in 2020 after Epic unveiled an in-app payment system into the game.",
      "The move led to the current court battle between the two companies.",
      "Apple did not directly addresses Judge Gonzalez Rogers' stunning rebuke of company executives in its court filing.",
      "In her most recent order, she said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with her injunction, and allowed then-Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri to convince him not to.",
      "\"Cook chose poorly,\" she wrote.",
      "The company documents she reviewed reveal \"that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option\", she wrote.",
      "Judge Gonzalez Rogers said she would refer the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate if a criminal contempt proceeding against Apple is appropriate.",
      "Apple said last week it would comply with the court's order while it appeals.",

      "While some experts argue the unique use of AI is just another step into the future, others say it could become a slippery slope for using the technology in legal cases.",
      "His family used voice recordings, videos and pictures of Mr Pelkey, who was 37 when he was killed, to recreate him in a video using AI, his sister Stacey Wales told the BBC.",
      "Ms Wales said she wrote the words that the AI version read in court based on how forgiving she knew her brother to be.",
      "\"To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,\" said the AI version of Mr Pelkey in court. \"In another life, we probably could have been friends.\"",
      "\"I believe in forgiveness, and a God who forgives. I always have and I still do,\" the AI verison of Mr Pelkey - wearing a grey baseball cap - continues.",
      "The technology was used at his killer's sentencing - Horcasitas already had been found guilty by a jury - some four years after Horcasitas shot Mr Pelkey at a red light in Arizona.",
      "The Arizona judge who oversaw the case, Todd Lang, seemed to appreciate the use of AI at the hearing. He sentenced Horcasitas to 10-and-a-half years in prison on manslaughter charges.",
      "\"I loved that AI, thank you for that. As angry as you are, as justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness,\" Judge Lang said. \"I feel that that was genuine.\"",
      "Paul Grimm, a retired federal judge and Duke Law School professor, told the BBC he was not surprised to see AI used in the Horcasitas sentencing.",
      "Arizona courts, he notes, already have started using AI in other ways. When the state's Supreme Court issues a ruling, for example, it has an AI system that makes those rulings digestible for people.",
      "And Mr Grimm said because it was used without a jury present, just for a judge to decide sentencing, the technology was allowed.",
      "\"We'll be leaning [AI] on a case-by-case basis, but the technology is irresistible,\" he said.",
      "But some experts like Derek Leben, a business ethics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, are concerned about the use of AI and the precedent this case sets.",
      "While Mr Leben does not question this family's intention or actions, he worries not all uses of AI will be consistent with a victim's wishes.",
      "\"If we have other people doing this moving forward, are we always going to get fidelity to what the person, the victim in this case, would've wanted?\" Mr Leben asked.",
      "For Ms Wales, however, this gave her brother the final word.",
      "\"We approached this with ethics and morals because this is a powerful tool. Just like a hammer can be used to break a window or rip down a wall, it can also be used as a tool to build a house and that's how we used this technology,\" she said."

      "High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.",
      "Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.",
      "One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.",
      "Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.",
      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",
      "According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.",
      "\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"",
      "Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.",
      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",
      "The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.",
      "Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.",
      "\"It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,\" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.",
      "His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"",
      "At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.",
      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",
      "For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers.",
      "Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome.",
      "That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria.",

      "She was just 26 years old at the time - and had clearly impressed Botswana's incoming President Duma Boko, whose Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) had just won a landslide, ousting the party that had governed for 58 years.",
      "It was a seismic shift in the politics of the diamond-rich southern African nation - and Boko, a 55-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer, hit the ground running.",

      "It also has a high level of unemployment - 28%, which is even higher for young people and women who have limited economic opportunities and battle systemic corruption.",

      "A month into her appointment, she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create \"peace desks\" at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims.",
      "At the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness.",
      "This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season - this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue.",
      "The minister reiterated - on several occasions, including before parliament in March - that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied.",

      "\"It will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home, how parents behave around their children, how they model good behaviour.\"",

      "\"I hear a lot of people say: 'Why do you speak of women more than men?'",
      "\"It's because as it stands in society, women are mostly prejudiced [against].",
      "\"But when we speak of gender equality, we're saying that it should be applied equally for everyone. But what we strive for is gender equity.\"",
      "Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her - saying that women had to work \"10 times harder\" to succeed.",
      "\"[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive. And growing up, I got to realise that it's not an easy thing.",

      "Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft is likely to have re-entered the Earth's atmosphere after being stuck in orbit for more than half a century, the European Space Agency said.",
      "Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit and instead broke into four pieces that have been circling the planet for more than five decades.",
      "The EU Space Surveillance and Tracking centre (SST) said one fragment - believed to be the lander - \"most likely\" re-entered the atmosphere at about 06:16 GMT (07:16 BST) on Saturday.",
      "It is unclear whether the object fell to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere.",
      "It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere.",
      "While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage.",
      "\"It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,\" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said.",
      "Kosmos 482's lander capsule was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it had a robust heat shield and durable structure.",
      "This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere.",
      "However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space.",
      "Mr Lemmens explained that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently\". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones.",
      "Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground.",
      "China's Long March 5B booster re-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and the Tiangong-1 space station mostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018.",
      "Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies.",
      "Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft \"should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries\".",
      "This would allow for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas and protecting people and property while \"managing the environmental impact of space debris\"."

      "Israel and the US accuse Hamas of diverting aid. \"Previous actions have often been met with Hamas stealing the food that was intended for hungry people,\" the ambassador said.",
      "The UN and other agencies say they have strong supervisory mechanisms and that when aid has surged into Gaza, incidents of looting have largely halted. The World Health Organization says none of its medical supplies have been looted during the war.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to build momentum behind the new aid initiative ahead of the president's trip next week to wealthy Arab Gulf countries that could help to fund it.",
      "It says that a non-governmental organisation has been set up and that aid delivery will not be under Israeli military control.",

      "Aimed at potential donors, the paper states that \"months of conflict have collapsed traditional relief channels in Gaza\".",
      "It goes on: \"GHF was established to restore that vital lifeline through an independent, rigorously-audited model that gets assistance directly - and only - to those in need.\"",

      "The Gaza war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Some 59 are still held captive, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Israel's military campaign has killed more than 52,700 people in Gaza, mostly women, children and the elderly, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Last Sunday, Israel's security cabinet approved an intensified military offensive against Hamas in Gaza which could involve forcibly displacing the population to the south, seizing the entire territory indefinitely, and controlling aid.",
      "This was quickly met with widespread international condemnation. Many of Israel's allies pointed out that it was bound under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid.",
      "The UK's Minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer, told Parliament on Monday that the British government was gravely concerned that the Israeli announcements could lead to the 19-month-long war in Gaza entering \"a dangerous new phase\".",
      "On the subject of aid, he said: \"As the UN has said, it is hard to see how, if implemented, the new Israeli plan to deliver aid through private companies would be consistent with humanitarian principles and meet the scale of the need. We need urgent clarity from the Israeli government on their intentions.",
      "\"We must remember what is at stake. These humanitarian principles matter for every conflict around the world. They should be applied consistently in every war zone.\"",
      "This week, the US Special Envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, briefed members of the UN Security Council - which includes the UK - behind closed doors about the new plan to resume the delivery of aid.",
      "The Council's five European members - the UK, France, Denmark, Greece and Slovenia - have requested an urgent meeting to discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza, likely to be scheduled for Tuesday.",
      "The UK delegation said Israel's blockade was \"inexcusable\", adding that the only way to end the suffering of both Palestinians and Israelis was to return to a ceasefire, secure the release of all hostages and \"surge\" aid into Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, Israeli media reported that Israeli forces were already setting up distribution hubs in Rafah, in southern Gaza, in \"a sterile zone\" designed to be free of any Hamas presence.",
      "According to reports, Israel expects that aid will be distributed to security-screened representatives from each Gazan family who would be allowed to take supplies for his or her relatives only. They would be allowed into the hubs only on foot.",
      "The Israeli defence establishment was said to have assessed that the average quantity of aid that would have to be distributed as 70kg (154lb) per family per week.",
      "The Israeli military would ultimately be stationed outside the distribution hubs, allowing aid workers to hand out food without soldiers being directly involved, the reports say.",
      "Israel and the US argue that the new system would prevent Hamas from being able to steal food for its own benefit. By preventing its access to aid and involvement in security for convoys, they hope to reduce the group's influence over the Gazan population.",
      "However, there are major questions over the plan's feasibility. The current UN system uses some 400 points of aid distribution, while the situation in Gaza is now at a crisis point, with warnings that mass starvation is imminent.",
      "At a UN briefing in Geneva, aid officials said they had carried out \"careful analysis\" before deciding they could not participate in the US-Israeli scheme. They said they had not been formally presented with the GHF document that is currently circulating.",
      "James Elder, spokesman for the UN's children's agency Unicef, said the plan that had been laid out would lead to more children suffering, not fewer. He noted that civilians would have to travel to militarised zones to receive aid, meaning the most vulnerable - children and the elderly - would struggle to get there.",
      "He said the decision to locate all the distribution points in the south appeared designed to use aid as \"a bait\" to forcibly displace Gazans once again. The UN says 90% of the population has been displaced during the war, often many times.",
      "The plan that has been discussed with UN agencies envisages just 60 lorry loads of aid entering each day - far less than they say is needed to meet growing needs, and a tenth of the number that went in daily during the recent two-month ceasefire.",
      "OCHA's Jens Laerke said that in short, the proposals from Israel \"do not meet the minimum bar for principled humanitarian support\".",
      "Analysts say that the current impasse over aid for Gaza is not only an existential threat to the UN's vast humanitarian operation in the Palestinian territory but could also have implications for its future work.",
      "If it was to agree to a scheme accommodating the demands of the military on one side in a conflict, it could dent perceptions of the UN's neutrality and impartiality, and set a dangerous precedent leading to similar demands in other war zones where it operates.",
      "The UN and other aid agencies also point out that they currently have tonnes of supplies piled up near Gaza's border crossings, ready to enter, if Israel would allow it.",
      "Without an end to the blockade, the risk of famine is expected to grow.",
      "In Jabalia, in northern Gaza, which has already been the focus of Israeli military operations against Hamas, Palestinian families told the BBC of their growing despair as they waited for a food handout at a takia, or community kitchen, which turned into a chaotic scramble.",
      "\"Every day I come here and wait with my cooking pot to feed my children,\" Umm Ahmed said. \"The pot doesn't fill us up. We have been suffering for two months. There's no flour or anything. Open the borders so we can eat properly.\"",
      "She said she would not comply with Israeli efforts to force her to move south to Rafah to receive aid.",
      "\"We don't have money for transport, we don't have money to eat!\" she exclaimed. \"I don't want to evacuate from here, I'd rather die than leave.\"",
      "\"The takia is our last source of food,\" said Mohammed, who had been waiting for five hours in line. \"My wife is pregnant and sick, and I'm unable to get her to the hospital. How am I supposed to get to Rafah?\"",

    "summary": "Charlie Hopkins was imprisoned in Alcatraz in the 1950s, where he spent three \"lonely\" years.",
    "story": [
      "When Charlie Hopkins thinks back to the three years he spent in one of America's most famous prisons, he remembers the \"deathly quiet\" the most.",
      "In 1955, Hopkins was sent to Alcatraz - a famed prison on an isolated island off the coast of San Francisco - after causing trouble at other prisons to serve a 17-year sentence for kidnapping and robbery.",
      "Falling asleep at night in his cell on the remote island, he said, the only sound was the whistle of ships passing.",
      "\"That's a lonely sound,\" Hopkins said. \"It reminds you of Hank Williams singing that song, 'I'm so lonesome I could cry.'\"",
      "Now 93 and living in Florida, Hopkins said the San Francisco National Archives informed him that he is likely the last surviving former Alcatraz inmate. The BBC could not independently verify this.",
      "In an interview with the BBC this week, Hopkins described life at Alcatraz - which formed the setting for the 1996 film The Rock - where he made friends with gangsters and once helped plan an unsuccessful escape.",
      "Although it closed decades ago, US President Donald Trump recently claimed that he wants to re-open it as a federal prison.",
      "When Hopkins was transferred to the high-security prison in 1955, from an Atlanta facility, he remembers it being clean, but barren. And there were few distractions - no radio at the time, and few books, he said.",
      "\"There was nothing to do,\" he said. \"You could walk back and forth in your cell or do push-ups.\"",
      "Hopkins kept busy part of the time with his job cleaning Alcatraz, sweeping the floors and buffing them \"until they shined\", he said.",
      "He was sent to prison in 1952 in Jacksonville, Florida, for his role in a series of robberies and kidnappings. He was part of a group that took hostages to get through roadblocks and steal cars, he said.",
      "The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon",
      "The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon",
      "At Alcatraz, Hopkins had some infamous neighbours. The facility housed many violent criminals over its 30 years - Al Capone; Robert Stroud, a murderer known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\"; and crime boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger - making it the subject of a host of films and television shows.",
      "A 22-acre island, 1.25 miles (2km) off San Francisco and surrounded by freezing waters with strong currents, Alcatraz was originally a naval defence fort. It was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison. The US Justice Department took it over in the 1930s, transforming the facility into a federal prison to address rampant organised crime at the time.",
      "Even in the high-security prison, Hopkins said he still managed to get into trouble and spent many days in the facility's \"D Block\" - solitary confinement where inmates who misbehaved were held and rarely let out of their cells.",
      "His longest stint there - six months - came after he tried to help several other prisoners, including notorious bank robber Forrest Tucker, escape Alcatraz, Hopkins said. He helped steal hacksaw blades from the prison's electric shop to cut the prison bars in the basement kitchen.",
      "The plan didn't work - prison guards discovered the blades in other inmates' cells, Hopkins said. \"A few days after they locked them up, they locked me up,\" he said.",
      "But that did not stop one of the inmates.",
      "In 1956, when Tucker was taken to a hospital for a kidney operation, he stabbed his ankle with a pencil so prison guards would have to remove his leg irons, Tucker told the New Yorker. Then, as he was taken to get an X-ray, he overpowered hospital orderlies and ran away, he said.",
      "He was captured in a hospital gown in a cornfield hours later.",
      "As more prisoners attempted to escape Alcatraz over the years, officials ramped up security, Hopkins said.",
      "\"When I left there in 1958, the security was so tight you couldn't breathe,\" he said.",
      "All told, there were 14 separate attempts over the years involving 36 inmates, according to the National Park Service.",
      "One of the most famous involved Frank Morris, and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, who escaped in June 1962 by placing papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads in their beds and breaking out through ventilation ducts. They were never found, but the FBI concluded that they drowned in the cold waters surrounding the island.",
      "A year later, the prison shut down after the government determined it would be more cost-effective to build new prisons than to keep the remote island facility in operation.",
      "Now it's a publicly run museum visited by millions each year that generates about $60m (\u00a345m) a year in revenue for park partners.",
      "The building is decrepit, with peeling paint, rusted pipes, and crumbling toilets in each cramped cell. Construction on the main prison facility began in 1907, and more than a century of exposure to the elements has rendered the place all but uninhabitable.",
      "Trump said this week, however, that he wants his government to re-open and expand the island prison for the country's \"most ruthless and violent offenders\".",
      "Alcatraz \"represents something very strong, very powerful\" - law and order, Trump said.",
      "But experts and historians said Trump's proposal to re-establish the prison is far-fetched, as it would cost billions to repair and bring up to date with other federal facilities.",
      "Hopkins agrees. \"It would be so expensive,\" he said.",
      "\"Back then, the sewage system went into the ocean,\" he added. \"They'd have to come up with another way of handling that.\"",
      "Hopkins left Alcatraz five years before it closed down for good. He had been transferred to a prison in Springfield, Missouri and given psychiatric medication that improved his behaviour and helped him heal psychological issues, he said.",
      "But the avid Trump supporter said he does not believe the president's proposal is serious.",
      "\"He don't really want to open that place,\" Hopkins said, adding that Trump was trying to \"get a point across to the public\" about punishing criminals and those who enter the US illegally.",
      "Hopkins was released in 1963, working first at a truck stop before taking on other jobs. He went back to his home state of Florida, where now he has a daughter and grandson.",
      "After several decades reflecting on his crimes and life in Alcatraz, he wrote a 1,000-page memoir, with nearly half of the book detailing his troubled behaviour, he said.",
      "\"You wouldn't believe the trouble I caused them when I was there,\" he said. \"I can see now, looking back, that I had problems.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 11 May 2025 06:20:59 GMT",
    "summary": "It is a safeguard against unlawful imprisonment - but the White House is \"actively looking\" at pausing it.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, the principle that a person should be able to challenge their detention in court.",
      "Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, says the legal principle is a \"privilege\" that could be suspended to make it easier to detain and deport immigrants.",
      "Recent court challenges by migrants and dissenting students who have been held in immigration detention centres have cited habeas corpus as a reason for their release.",
      "But what the legal procedure does - and what could happen if it were to be suspended - is complex.",
      "What does habeas corpus mean?",
      "Scholars say the principle that a person should not be illegally imprisoned pre-dates the Magna Carta, and has been a cornerstone of the legal system in the UK, US and other democratic countries around the world for centuries.",
      "Roughly translated from Latin, habeas corpus means \"you should have the body\" - as in, a person must be able to appear before a court so that a judge can assess if that person has been lawfully detained.",
      "Also known as the \"Great Writ of Liberty\", habeas corpus grants prisoners the right to challenge their imprisonment in a court of law.",
      "Is habeas corpus a right in the US Constitution?",
      "Article One of the US Constitution states that \"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\".",
      "While this is the only time habeas corpus is mentioned in the Constitution, it has become an important part of US law - and has frequently been fought over in the courts, including the US Supreme Court.",
      "Has habeas corpus been suspended before?",
      "Abraham Lincoln became the first US president to suspend habeas corpus in 1861, during the American Civil War.",
      "That lead to a showdown with Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, who said it was Congress - not the executive branch of government - that had the power to suspend the writ.",
      "Lincoln continued to suspend habeas corpus in specific incidences, according to the National Constitution Center, and in 1863 Congress approved suspending it for the duration of the war when \"the public safety may require it\".",
      "It was also suspended several times in the years following the Civil War, during the Reconstruction period, to quash rebellions by the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group.",
      "After the bombing of Pearl Harbour by the Japanese in World War Two, habeas corpus was suspended in Hawaii, which paved the way for the arrest of Japanese Americans on the island.",
      "What do modern courts say about habeas corpus?",
      "The courts have found that both US citizens and non-citizens have the right to habeas corpus. In 2008, the US Supreme Court extended this to include non-citizens detained in a foreign prison - such as Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.",
      "But just because prisoners have the right to challenge their detention, it does not guarantee they will be able to leave custody.",
      "Succeeding with a habeas corpus petition is extremely rare - most people who are detained have been detained for lawful reasons, courts have generally found.",
      "Asadullah Haroon Gul was the first Guantanamo detainee to win a habeas corpus petition in 2021. He was transferred back to Afghanistan more than a decade after the US Supreme Court found that detainees had habeas corpus privileges.",
      "But as Trump's administration has ramped up arrests of illegal immigrants and student dissenters, habeas corpus has received renewed legal interest.",
      "In April, the Supreme Court ruled that migrants being deported under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act must be given enough notice of their removal to file petitions. It temporarily blocked some deportations in Texas for this reason.",
      "Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained after becoming a leading figure in pro-Palestinian campus protests, has filed his own habeas corpus petition, as he is in the middle of deportation hearings.",

      "\"We're 100% reliant on the travel across the border,\" she says of duty frees. \"Our stores are often pillars of these communities - communities depend on them.\"",
      "And while the crossing at Port Huron-Sarnia is faring better than most, on a Friday in May the parking lot of the Sarnia Duty Free is almost empty.",

      "On Easter weekend - usually one of their busiest of the year, as Canadians take advantage of the break to stop in at a favourite restaurant and go to a church service in Port Huron  - cars were few and far between, and sales were not what they should have been, she says.",
      "\"We are suffering because of collateral damage at the border,\" Ms Lee says of her second-generation family business.",
      "She notes that people who live in border towns often cross the boundary multiple times a week. Ms Lee, for example, has a mailbox at a shipping facility in Port Huron that she visits regularly, as do her neighbours.",

      "She has heard from both residents of her town and Canadians frustrated about the increased tension between the nations.",

      "TV, film and media executive Barry Diller spent a decade at ABC, where he helped popularize the made-for-TV \"Movie of the Week.\" In his new memoir, \"Who Knew\" (to be published on May 20 by Simon & Schuster), Diller writes about his career, including a lesson about the limitations of too much information \u2013 when instinct (for, like, what makes an intriguing Movie of the Week?) may be a better predictor of success.",

      "Sometimes the staff would ask, \"Is it commercial?\" and I would brutalize them, because rather than using their instincts, they were trying to predict the public's appetite, which I said then and say now, over and over again, simply isn't possible. Neither is using research to help make decisions. No amount of research on ideas is worth the paper (or computer screen) it's printed on. Data can tell you what has happened, not what can or will happen.\u00a0Data is often harmful to instinct, and I believe this to be true for making not only creative decisions but many business decisions. PowerPoint can be the enemy; structured information often narrows the sieve just when you need to broaden it out in the spaces between information and real understanding. Overtraining our brains on data alone doesn't confer an advantage, and it can be a deterrent if it's the only decision-making component. That's often the problem with MBA students, who come armed with all the business tools and case studies but little simple human instinct. I do not believe that using instinct rather than deep, hard numerical or fact-based data to help with decision-making is the lazier process. Too much information can overload, overcomplicate, and obscure what is at the essence of any proposal: Is it a good idea, and does it make any common sense?",
      "You rarely get the perfect project or the perfect script. In all my experience I probably haven't read ten scripts out of a thousand that are so fully realized, so utterly and incontrovertibly great that you just scream, \"Make it!\" One of those, though, was the day in 1970 that Leonard Goldberg, who had recently moved on from ABC to run a large television production company, called up and said, \"You must read this script right now.\" It was called Brian's Song, the story of the deep bond between a Black and a white pro football player, one who will die of cancer. I wept as I read it. I called him up and said, \"We can only screw it up from here\u2014it's perfect\u2014let's go.\" Often referred to as one of the finest television films ever made\u2014and one of the greatest sports films as well\u2014it was nominated for nine Emmys and won five. Another of those few times, Dan Curtis, a leading ABC daytime producer, sent me a manuscript of an as-yet-unpublished novel called The Kolchak Papers. I read it in two or three hours\u2014it was the contemporary tale of a vampire in Las Vegas\u2014and I told Dan, \"This is as good a story as I've ever read.\" And what a great idea: Las Vegas, a city most alive at night\u2014the perfect place for a vampire to live.",
      "Out of that novel we made The Night Stalker, which turned out to be so good that we held a screening for the senior ABC management, who all said, \"That's a great movie. We should release it theatrically!\" I fought against that, saying, \"Yes, it's a great movie, but it's a Movie of the Week, and that's where it belongs.\" We aired the film in early January 1972, and it became ABC's highest-rated Movie of the Week, drawing about 50 million people, a record. The Night Stalker spawned a sequel (The Night Strangler) and a television series (Kolchak: The Night Stalker), and it was followed by two more made-for-TV movies and a subsequent remake of the series. All that from one good idea!",

      "\"Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see It Ends With Us until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"The connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, 'My Tears Ricochet.'\"",

      "Baldoni has denied the allegations and\u00a0countersued Lively in January for defamation, seeking $400 million from her and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, alleging extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy. He also filed a separate defamation lawsuit against the New York Times for its story that initially reported Lively's allegations against him.",
      "Swift, a longtime friend of Lively, was mentioned in Baldoni's countersuit, though not directly by her full name. The countersuit included text messages that indicated an alleged script meeting that appeared to have been also attended by Reynolds and \"Taylor.\"",
      "In text messages to Baldoni, according to the countersuit, Lively described Swift and Reynolds as her \"most trusted partners,\" saying they were her \"dragons\" in reference to the show \"Game of Thrones.\"",
      "Baldoni's lawyers argued in the countersuit that in Swift and Reynolds, Baldoni was facing \"two of the most influential and wealthy celebrities in the world, who were not afraid to make things very difficult for him.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in an\u00a0amended complaint filed in February, Lively alleged Baldoni made other women uncomfortable on set.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 May 2025 09:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is facing trial on sex-trafficking charges. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial on federal charges in New York City. Jury selection began May 5, and opening statements are expected on Monday, May 12.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs will be tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"freak offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"freak off.\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

      "It was Harris' first time at the benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. In an interview with Vogue published ahead of the blue carpet event, Harris emphasized the importance of art and how it intertwines with politics.",
      "\"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,\" Harris told Vogue. \"Artistic expression \u2014 whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion \u2014 has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.\"",
      "To embrace the 2025 Met Gala theme, inspired by the Met's exhibit \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" the former vice president wore a black-and-white Off-White gown designed by the brand's creative director IB Kamara, according to Vogue. Harris attended with her husband, Doug Emhoff, Vogue said.",
      "While politicians are no strangers to the Met Gala, many of them have been local New York City lawmakers in recent years, including Mayor Eric Adams and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In 2022, Hillary Clinton returned to fashion's biggest night 21 years after her debut. And in 1977, Ronald Reagan attended the Met Gala between his terms as governor of California and president of the United States.",
      "Harris may be eyeing a political return of her own.",
      "Speaking in San Francisco last week, in her first major public remarks since her 2024 presidential defeat, Harris blasted President Trump's economic agenda, including his tariffs. She also suggested she's been having conversations about her future, as California prepares to elect its next governor in 2026 and Democrats search for a presidential candidate to run in 2028.",
      "\"Everybody is asking me, 'Well, what've you been thinking about these days,'\" she said.",
      "Sources familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News she's weighing a gubernatorial bid in her home state, a third run for the presidency or not seeking elected office.",

      "Authorities said they arrested two people in connection with the planned attack \u2014 the alleged leader of the group on illegal weapons possession charges in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a teenager on child pornography charges in Rio.",
      "The concert was the biggest show of Gaga's career.",
      "\"Tonight, we're making history,\" Lady Gage told a screaming crowd. \"Thank you for making history with me.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Lady Gaga told CBS News the team learned of the alleged threats through media reports.",
      "\"Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,\" the spokesperson said. \"Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.\"",
      "The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show just after 10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song \"Bloody Mary.\" Cries of joy rose from the tightly packed fans who sang and danced shoulder to shoulder on the vast stretch of sand.",
      "Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show, which was funded by the city of Rio in an effort to revitalize the economy. In a recent report, Rio's City Hall said the show should bring in at least 600 million reais, or roughly $106 million.",
      "For Gaga, the performance was also an opportunity to promote her upcoming \"Mayhem Ball\" tour, featuring songs from her latest record MAYHEM. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 when it was released in early March and includes new hits like \"Abracadabra.\"",
      "Lady Gaga also performed a number of older classics at her free show Saturday, including \"Poker Face\" and \"Alejandro,\" switching between an array of dresses including one with the colors of the Brazilian flag.",
      "Some fans \u2014 many of them young \u2014 arrived on the beach at the crack of dawn to secure a good spot, armed with snacks and drinks. They spent the day under a blazing sun, while others perched in trees, determined to get a panoramic view.",
      "\"Today is the best day of my life,\" said Manoela Dobes, a 27-year-old designer who was wearing a dress plastered with a photograph from when she met Lady Gaga in the United States in 2019. \"It's surreal to be here.\"",
      "Madonna also turned Copacabana Beach into a massive dance floor last year.",
      "The large-scale performances are part of an effort led by City Hall to boost economic activity after Carnival and New Year's Eve festivities and the upcoming month-long Saint John's Day celebrations in June.",
      "\"It brings activity to the city during what was previously considered the low season \u2014 filling hotels and increasing spending in bars, restaurants, and retail, generating jobs and income for the population,\" said Osmar Lima, the city's secretary of economic development, in a statement released by Rio City Hall's tourism department last month.",
      "Similar concerts are scheduled to take place every year in May at least until 2028.",
      "Lady Gaga arrived in Rio in the early hours of Tuesday. The city has been alive with Gaga-mania since, as it geared up to welcome the pop star for her first show in the country since 2012. Rio's metro employees danced to Lady Gaga's 2008 hit song \"LoveGame\" and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out.",
      "While the vast majority of attendees were from Rio, the event also attracted Brazilians from across the country and international visitors.",

      "Ingrid Serrano, a 30-year-old engineer, traveled from Colombia to Brazil to attend the show.",

      "For her, the mega-star represents \"total freedom of expression \u2014 being who one wants without shame.\"",
      "Rio officials have a history of organizing huge concerts on Copacabana Beach. Madonna's show drew an estimated 1.6 million fans last year, while 4 million people flooded onto the beach for a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart in 1994. According to Guinness World Records, that was the biggest free rock concert in history.",
      "To ensure fans could hear the songs, sixteen sound towers were spread along the beach.",
      "Rio state's security plan included 3,300 members of the military, 1,500 police officers and 400 firefighters.",
      "Among those present were Lady Gaga admirers who remember their disappointment in 2017, when the artist canceled a performance scheduled in Rio at the last minute due to health issues.",
      "Ricardo Filho, who has been a fan since childhood, said it was worth the wait.",
      "\"She's the best artist in the world,\" the 25-year-old said, as chants of \"Gaga, I love you\" in Portuguese rose from the crowd behind him.",

      "The Spring 2025 exhibition, titled \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" will invoke Black creativity, innovation and expression in fashion, culture and style. The dress code of the 2025 Met Gala \u2014 typically related to the exhibit's theme \u2014 is \"Tailored for You,\" calling for a focus on suiting and menswear, according to the Met. The exhibit nods to the stories of Black style told through clothing by the African diaspora beginning in the 18th century.",
      "The exhibit is funded largely by contributions from the Met Gala, where every year the biggest and wealthiest names gather to show off the best in fashion.",

      "2024 Met Gala theme: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\"",
      "In 2024, the Met Gala explored the themes of rebirth and renewal through nature and the passage of time. Referencing the 1962 J.G. Ballard short story \"The Garden of Time\" celebrities, entrepreneurs, athletes and designers wore floral gowns and referenced nature's everlasting forms.",
      "Bad Bunny wore Margiela and Jennifer Lopez wore a Schiaparelli design. Both co-chaired the event with Wintour, who wore a Loewe custom floor-length jacket adorned in feathers that formed tulip bouquets. But Zendaya, another gala co-chair, stole the night by walking the carpet twice. She first wore Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano before changing quickly and closing out the most public part of the night, the strut into the event at the steps of the Met, in a 1996 black gown from John Galliano's Givenchy era, which she paired with a flower bouquet Alexander McQueen head piece designed by Philip Treacy.",
      "2023 Met Gala theme: \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\"",
      "The Met Gala honored the late designer Karl Lagerfeld in 2023 with a night of references to his style and his immense influence in the fashion world. Some wore Lagerfeld's designs for Chanel, Fendi, Balmain and Chlo\u00e9, while others twisted his unique way of dressing, which combined black, white and leather for his daily wear, and later in life inspired the creative behind his eponymous label. There were also plenty of cat odes at the gala, a tribute to Lagerfeld's beloved feline friend Choupette,",
      "2022 Met Gala theme: \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\"",
      "The second installment of a two-part exhibition on fashion in the United States, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\" celebrated two centuries of American identity through fashion's eyes. \"Gilded Glamour\" graced the gala's red carpet and American history references were prevalent.",
      "The most recognized garment belonged to Marilyn Monroe. The nude, form-fitting number shined on the style icon while she serenaded then-president John F. Kennedy for his birthday in 1962. Kim Kardashian wore the dress after entering a deal with the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum to bring the garment out of its display. The uproar was immediate, as some alleged possible damage to the dress. Ripley's was forced to respond\u00a0denying the heated claims.",
      "2021 Met Gala theme: \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\"",
      "The first of two parts, \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" wove together identities of the ever-changing U.S. through time, exploring the emotions behind the country's evolving culture. Instagram sponsored the event and brought to the carpet executives turned celebrities, including author, viral influencer and director of fashion partnerships at Instagram Evan Chen, and the social app's chief Adam Mosseri.",
      "After a pause for the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, social hesitance was still evident and masks were incorporated into some of the night's designs. Of note, Billie Eilish wore an Oscar De La Renta dress for a cause, calling for the storied house to end its ties to fur.",
      "2019 Met Gala theme: \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\"",
      "Guests brought their imagination to the pink carpet for the 2019 \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" gala rendition. Gender-bending was evident\u00a0and many looks turned heads, like Jared Leto's interpretation of Alessandro Michele's world of Gucci. Lady Gaga's iconic Brandon Maxwell looks told a story of style with each step the singer took outside of the Met. Framed around Susan Sontag's 1964 essay \"Notes on 'Camp,'\" the gala brought to life the whimsical and effervescent nature of fashion.",
      "2018 Met Gala theme: \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\"",
      "The 2018 Met Gala theme drew inspiration from Catholicism. \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" explored religious iconography and the influence of medieval art in fashion. Guests brought to life looks that referenced papal garments and displayed biblical artifacts like crosses, angel wings and halos. The theme's ties to the history of Christ were not well received by some critics who thought fashion should stay out of the church.",
      "2017 Met Gala theme: \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the In-Between\"",
      "The 2017 event paid tribute to Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons avant-garde designs that play with the body's shape and form. Duality, a motif for the exhibit, highlighted almost four decades of her work. Guests brought to the event pops of red from Kawakubo's palette, intricate embellishments and sheer fabrics. Caroline Kennedy and Rihanna embraced more fantastical designs, pairing shape-shifting silhouettes with florals, inducing more authenticity to a much-subdued theme interpretation.",
      "2016 Met Gala theme: \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\"",
      "The influence of technology in fashion turned the 2016 Met Gala into a spectacular display of metallics and cutting-edge designs. Many of the garnmets appeared too intricate and precise to be man-made, an ode to the artisans all over the world who piece together exquisite Haute Couture creations by pouring thousands of hours into each work. CBS News spent the day with supermodel and entrepreneur Karlie Kloss, who wore a sleek white Brandon Maxwell number that referenced classic men's tailoring paired with Ala\u00efa-esque angular cuts.",
      "2015 Met Gala theme \"China: Through the Looking Glass\"",
      "While the 2015 Met exhibit scoped a wide history of artifacts and influence from Asian art, the gala came down to just one word: Rihanna. Dawning a sunny yellow cape that cascaded down the steps of the Met, the singer and fashion icon elevated the meaning of attending fashion's biggest night. The couture garment designed by China's Guo Pei took two years to make, Rihanna told Vanity Fair. The look quickly comes to mind around the world when the first Monday in May is discussed.",
      "2014 Met Gala theme: \"Charles James: Beyond Fashion\"",
      "The Costume Institute has been celebrating those behind fashion since its inception, and in 1973 it began hosting the gala within the museum itself, Vogue recounts. Fashion authority Diana Vreeland brought to life \"The World of Balenciaga\" after exiting Vogue as editor-in-chief, and her tribute to Spanish designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga left a blueprint for other designer-centered celebrations that followed.",
      "In 2014, couturier Charles James' work went on display at the Met and guests embraced brilliant gowns with his grandiose touch. James' tailored and structural approach to the female form, mixed with modern fabrics, brought elegance and regalia to the occasion.",
      "2013 Met Gala theme: \"Punk: Chaos to Couture\"",
      "Anti-establishment influence inked its way into the Met's\u00a0history in 2013.\u00a0Started in the 1970's, the punk movement gave guests a reason to wear garments embellished with the spirit of teen disobedience and air of grungy D.I.Y. personal style. Madonna honored the era with fishnets, metal studs and silver chains adorning a Givenchy mini plaid blazer by Riccardo Tisci. Rebellion was also apparent in the hairstyles exhibited, most notably by singer Miley Cyrus, a fashion fanatic, whose short, spiked look paired perfectly with her risque fishnet Marc Jacobs gown.",
      "What was the first Met Gala theme?",
      "The Costume Institute started holding benefits in 1948, but it was Vreeland who brought themed galas to the next level as a Met consultant with \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, according to Vogue.",
      "Full list of past Met Gala themes over the years",

      "Rogers has had a challenging tenure atop the agency's inspections workforce. He was the top official overseeing food inspections during the infant formula crisis in 2022,\u00a0 when the agency mishandled whistleblower complaints about a troubled formula plant linked to a deadly recall. He also oversaw a resulting reorganization of the FDA's inspections office in 2024.",
      "Two FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Rogers had told colleagues privately that he was miserable in recent days, as the agency's inspections office has reeled from sweeping cuts to its ranks ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The cuts have come as FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has publicly touted plans to expand foreign surprise inspections, despite the agency privately struggling to keep up with inspections due to layoffs, early retirements and resignations.",
      "Makary also announced Monday at the White House that he was planning to cut the length of foreign inspection trips, claiming the move would result in more inspections.",
      "\"We're also not going to have our inspectors hanging out for three or four weeks. They're going to get in and out, and we're going to do more inspections with the same resources as a result,\" Makary said.",
      "Multiple current and former FDA officials said they were perplexed by Makary's claim, given the push for longer trips in the past had been an efficiency measure intended to result in the agency being able to complete more inspections.",
      "Instead of spending money and wearing down staff to fly in and out of a country to do each inspection, officials said, the agency would combine multiple inspections into a single trip.",
      "\"So they're going to double or triple the foreign inspection flight costs and keep my people in a perpetual state of jet lag,\" one FDA official told CBS News.",
      "Multiple officials warned of a drain on morale for the agency's workforce, given long-running challenges with hiring and retaining investigators.",
      "\"No one is 'hanging out.' You inspect Monday to Friday. If you're lucky you have the weekend to recover,\" the official said.",
      "Officials also said it was not possible to increase the number of foreign inspections while also cutting down on the length of foreign trips without cutting corners on oversight.",
      "FDA officials and outside auditors have closely studied how long the agency takes to complete its oversight work, as it has struggled to cut down on a backlog of foreign inspections and complaints.",
      "\"It's fairly basic math. We know how long inspectional activities take. If they get shorter, which inspections activities are we no longer performing,\" another FDA official said.",

      "The CPSC is an independent agency that regulates the safety of consumer products, from toys to appliances. It's the group that often handles recalls of items such as kitchen ranges that can set fires and steam cleaners that have burned users.",
      "In his statement, Trumka said he was given no reason for his firing, but that his dismissal came after he and two other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to work at the agency. Trumka, who was appointed to a 7-year term by President Biden in 2021, said he pushed back against DOGE because \"if these people are allowed in to govern our agency, they will gut it and the result will turn back the clock on product safety.\"",

They asked if we would allow them to implant at  our agency. They asked for our answer to that by 6 p.m. We said 'no.' And moments later, we were fired by email from the president.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, however, in a press briefing Friday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that the CPSC falls under the executive branch, giving the president the right to fire employees there.",
      "Consumer Reports issued a statement condemning the CPSC firings, and said that the commissioners should be reinstated immediately.",
      "\"This is an appalling and lawless attack on the independence of our country's product safety watchdog,\" said William Wallace, director of safety advocacy for Consumer Reports, in an email. \"Anyone who cares about keeping their family safe should oppose this move and demand that it be reversed.\"",

      "\"The Consumer Product Safety Commission makes sure toys are safe for our kids and the products Americans use everyday don't have hidden hazards,\" Klobuchar said in a statement. \"It conducts thousands of investigations and issues crucial recalls .... This move is dangerous and illegal.\"",
      "DOGE firings",
      "DOGE has sought to cut federal workers in the name of reducing fraud, waste and abuse. But many of its firings have had to be reversed, either because the group mistakenly fired essential workers \u2014 like bird-flu experts with the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 or after a court ruled the dismissals were illegal.",

    "summary": "President Trump says a new U.S. trade pact with the U.K. can serve as the basis for more trade deals. Economists say that could be a problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday hailed his new trade pact with the U.K. as a \"maxed out deal\" that will serve as a template for agreements with other nations. But some experts are taking a dimmer view, noting that the U.K. agreement suggests high tariffs are set to remain in place for the long term.",
      "Although the deal with Britain offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports. Mr. Trump unveiled that baseline levy, which serves more broadly as a minimum import tax on other nations, as part of his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Friday that the president is \"committed to the 10% baseline tariff, not just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well.\"",
      "While a 10% tariff rate is lower than some import duties Mr. Trump imposed on other nations last month, ranging from a high of 145% for China to 11% for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it's still far higher than the effective tariff rate of 3% prior to the second Trump administration, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a nonpartisan policy think tank.",
      "Paring Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs to 10% could offer some relief for U.S. businesses and consumers facing higher costs. But it still represents a major headwind for importers, which pay the duties on goods and then pass on all or most of the cost to consumers, economists say.",
      "\"Even with a slow rollout of trade deals over the coming months, you're still going to have an effective average tariff rate that is going to be in the double-digit range,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What that means for businesses is that they're simply going to be paying more for the same goods that they have been importing, and they're going to be raising prices onto customers that have much less ability to withstand ongoing price increases.\"",
      "That, in turn, could cause Americans to tighten their wallets, a serious risk given that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 cents of every $1 in economic activity. Businesses that are stressed by tariffs could slow hiring, leading to a pullback in household income growth, Daco said.",
      "\"Modest improvement\"",
      "The deal with Britain is \"a modest improvement over what we had yesterday, but \u2014 with most U.S. tariffs still in place and very limited new U.K. liberalization \u2014 remains worse than the pre-Trump status quo,\" Scott Lincicome, Cato Institute vice president of economics, said in an email.",
      "The economic stakes for U.S. trade talks are high, with economists raising the chances of a recession due to fallout from Mr. Trump's trade war. The stock market tumbled and U.S. Treasury prices slid in the days immediately following the president's April 2 tariff announcement, underlining investor concerns that a trade war could torpedo economic growth.",
      "Stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the new\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0with the U.K.",
      "While Wall Street has largely rebounded since then on growing investor optimism that the Trump administration will soon strike new trade deals, many Americans are souring on Mr. Trump's policies. In a recent CBS News poll, 53% of those surveyed said they believe the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only 41% approved of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Even as the U.S. tries to negotiate additional trade agreements, businesses continue to face significant risks, economists note. These stem from the ongoing uncertainty over the ultimate level and duration of tariffs, making it hard for companies who depend on trade to make plans on spending, hiring and their supply chains.",
      "\"Even if this tariff is lower, this fundamental anxiety related to uncertainty and unpredictability\" remains,\" said Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"If this is not resolved or addressed, then I think it'll be difficult for consumers, investors and business to fully recover.\"",
      "Even so, some experts note that the Trump administration's efforts to strike new trade deals could provide some relief to investors and businesses, as long as there's growing clarity about where the tariff policies could settle.",
      "\"Now, at least the wheels are in motion relative to discussions with a variety of countries, with the deal between the United States and U.K. as perhaps indicative of the fact that there could be tariff and trade-related de-escalation \u2014 even without a fully drawn out trade agreement,\" noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration is \"focused on the big countries,\" although he added that negotiations could drag out.",
      "\"The president doesn't want to go fast,\" Lutnick said. \"He wants to do the kind of deal we did today, where we said, 'Look, this is just a win for America,' and we figured out how to make it a win for them.\"",
      "Key meeting with China",
      "The U.K. is a fairly modest trading partner for the U.S., representing about $65 billion in annual imports, or less than one-tenth of annual imports from China.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland, and Mr. Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on the nation's goods from its current 145% level.",
      "\"80% Tariff on China seems right!\" the president wrote\u00a0Friday morning.",
      "But that might not be enough to cushion the U.S. from the headwinds of higher tariffs, according to experts.",
      "\"Even if we were to see a continuation of the universal 10% tariff applied and some rollback of higher levels, or in the case of China, 145%, we're still talking about a tariff rate that is the highest since World War II,\" Luschini said. \"And so it's going to have an impact at some form.\"",

      "New parents and couples that are expecting could soon face tariff-related cost increases of up to $1,000 a year on baby essentials, according to Natalie Gordon, the CEO of Babylist, a baby registry service.",
      "Gordon noted that price increases are already in effect across a range of products, given manufacturers' reliance on China to produce strollers, cribs, car seats and other required goods. Currently, an import duty of up to 145% applies to U.S. imports from China, where the vast majority of strollers sold in the U.S. are made.",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday signaled that the rate\u00a0could come down, writing in a post on his social media platform Truth Social that an \"80% Tariff on China seems right!\"",
      "Calling for a reprieve",
      "Gordon is among a group of advocates calling on the White House to exempt critical baby products from sky-high tariffs. In addition to levies on Chinese products, a baseline 10% tariff applies to all U.S. imports. Additional country-based duties \u2014 with the exception of China \u2014 are currently on hold for 90 days.",
      "\"Manufacturers are, on a day-to-day basis, dealing with the shock of tariffs on products and are very willing to invest in supply chains,\" Gordon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are looking at what it takes to onshore products, but it takes time and investment.\"",

      "Although the midsize company, based in Portland, Oregon, operates in an industry that is highly exposed to tariffs, Keen tells customers that it will keep prices steady this year no matter how tariffs affect its costs. That's no idle pledge calculated to preserve market share \u2014 Keen has been steadily retooling the business for years to protect itself from sudden shifts in global trade and the vagaries of geopolitics.",
      "\"We have been preparing for this for over a decade. Early on, we saw the risks of being overdependent on any one country, so we made the decision to diversify our supply chain well beyond China,\" Chief Operating Officer Hari Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The 22-year-old company, with 650 U.S. employees and owned by design and brand management company Fuerst Group, has worked to reduce its dependence on Chinese manufacturing while expanding its U.S. presence and diversifying its supply chains.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are upending retailer supply chains, forcing them to devise workarounds. That can mean moving manufacturing to another foreign country with lower tariffs or investing in U.S.-based production. For small businesses, tariff-driven uncertainty\u00a0can mean shutting operations down altogether when the financials no longer add up.",
      "Shoe and clothing prices could soar",
      "Footwear companies are particularly vulnerable to the upheaval caused by President Trump's trade war, given their reliance on China, where 36%, or $9.8 billion's worth, of imported footwear sold in the U.S. is made, according to a TD Cowen analysis of international trade data.",
      "For that reason, tariffs are expected to hit footwear and apparel companies hard, and that impact will be felt by American consumers as well, according to Jason Judd, a global supply-chain expert and executive director of Cornell University's Global Labor Institute.",
      "In 2023, U.S. households spent an average of about $1,700 per year on footwear and apparel, Judd said. He expects that figure to surge 70% in the short term, to $2,800 per family, because of tariff-related price hikes. In the coming years, meanwhile, consumers are still likely to be paying more for footwear and clothing because of higher global tariffs.",
      "\"That pain will lessen as terms and sourcing patterns change, but the longer-term costs per family will still be around a $425 increase per year.\"",
      "The abrupt change in tariff policies is already rippling across the industry. German sportswear giant Adidas last month warned U.S. customers that \"cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases.\" And retailers across various industries, from apparel to food, have started passing some of the cost from higher import taxes to consumers in the form of\u00a0\"tariff surcharges.\"",
      "\"We saw the writing on the wall\"",
      "Today, Keen operates plants in Shepherdsville, Kentucky; the Dominican Republic; and Thailand, where it handles a third of the company's global production. It also contracts with manufacturing partners in Cambodia, India and Vietnam, all of which are subject to impending new U.S. levies. Cambodia faces a country-specific tariff rate of 49%, while Vietnam and India face levies of 47% and 27%, respectively.",
      "\"We do have 10% exposure in those countries, but the 10% tariff we're dealing with is significantly lower than what other companies are facing on products that would come out of China,\" Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Back in 2015, executives at Keen were already taking note of rising labor costs in China. Today, the company's broad supply chain helps it spread costs across the company, its manufacturing partners and their suppliers, he said. Keen, which is privately held, declined to share information on its annual revenues.",
      "\"We are making a conscious decision not to increase prices, but that's shared by our partners,\" he said. \"They share some of the costs with us, then they go to the company they buy materials from, and those tier-one suppliers share some of the costs as well.\"",

      "The president said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle of international trade.\"",
      "The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs \u2014 and the threat of the levies \u2014 as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration.",
      "Mr. Trump said the details of the agreement are still being finalized and expects it to be finished in the coming weeks. But he said it includes \"billions of dollars\" of increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol.",
      "Britain will also \"reduce or eliminate\" non-tariff barriers that Mr. Trump said discriminate against U.S. products, and fast-track American imports through U.K. customs, the president announced.",
      "He called the agreement a \"great deal for both our countries\" and said it is opening up access to Britain for U.S. products.",
      "\"It's going to be something very special for the U.K. and special for the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Delivering brief remarks by speakerphone, Starmer said the framework will boost trade between the U.S. and the U.K., protect and create jobs and open market access. Starmer called it a \"historic day\" that is a \"real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\"",
      "The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports, which was unveiled by the president last month as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, remains in place. But under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the deal will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. as a result of the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K. As part of the agreement, Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes, the commerce secretary said.",
      "Mr. Trump had teased the announcement Wednesday, writing on social media that he would unveil a \"major trade deal\" with a \"big, highly respected country,\" which he did not identify at the time. On Thursday morning, the president posted on Truth Social that it \"should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" he added. \"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\"",

      "\"As you know, talks with the U.S. have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today,\" Starmer said at a defense conference in London.",
      "Mr. Trump placed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, as well as 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum on the premise that doing so would foster more factory jobs domestically.",
      "A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel. The U.S. is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of U.K. auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products. Starmer's government has said it won't lower U.K. food standards to allow in chlorine-rinsed American chicken or hormone-treated beef.",
      "If a deal is announced, the British government will see it as a vindication of Starmer's emollient approach to Mr. Trump, which has avoided direct confrontation or criticism. Unlike the European Union, Britain didn't announce retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Mr. Trump's import taxes.",
      "A trade deal with the United Kingdom would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters. But an agreement would do little to address Mr. Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits that prompted him to impose import taxes on countries around the world.",
      "The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.",
      "The U.S. is much more important to the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.",
      "Mr. Trump has shown a desire to strike a trade agreement with the U.K. since it voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Yet as recently as Tuesday, Mr. Trump showed no awareness of the possible terms of the deal when asked about its possibility.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump claims that other countries and exporters to the U.S. will largely pick up the cost of tariffs. Yet recent data shows that companies are moving to pass along those added expenses to American consumers, which may push up prices.",
      "For example, 76% of Texas manufacturers said they plan to pass tariff-related costs to consumers, while 50% say they will absorb costs internally, according to recent\u00a0survey data\u00a0from Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Large retailers have also warned that steep new levies on U.S. imports are likely to drive up prices.",
      "\"The bottom line is that inflation will be rising significantly over the next six months,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Indeed, with businesses having to plan months in advance to account for tariffs, many companies are baking those costs into their pricing. In a recent EY survey of over 4,000 executives, two-thirds of respondents said they might have to pass tariff costs on to customers.",
      "The Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan policy institute based in Washington, D.C., notes that the economic fallout from the Trump administration's tariffs will fall largely on low- and middle-income consumers. The levies could cost households an average of $5,200 every year,\u00a0according to the nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Inflation ahead?",
      "Manufacturers expect their prices to increase 3.6% over the next 12 months, up from 2.3% in the last quarter of 2024, according to a recent survey from the National Association of Manufacturers, which cites manufacturers' concerns over trade.",
      "\"Nobody has the profitability to be able to eat the tariffs,\" David Loftus, CEO of the Electronic Component Industry Association, an industry trade group, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So the manufacturers pass to the distributors, who pass to the customers.\"",
      "A recent\u00a0Gallup poll found that nearly 90% of Americans expect tariffs to drive up prices this year. For now, tariffs have yet to budge prices \u2014 the Consumer Price Index in March\u00a0rose 2.4% on an annual basis, down from 2.8% in February.",
      "Yet many experts say that U.S. tariffs, coupled with retaliatory measures from other countries, are likely to boost consumer prices in the months ahead.",
      "\"With the new tariffs now in place, we look for a shift up in inflation, adding a headwind to already slowing consumer activity and economic growth,\" Nationwide economist Daniel Vielhaber told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that core inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, which tracks consumer spending, to rise this year to 3.8%, up from 2.6% in March. Electronics and apparel are likely to see the sharpest price increases, according to the investment bank.",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump has staunchly defended the tariffs as a way to restore what he calls fairness to global trade, reinvigorate U.S. manufacturers and generate federal revenues. When asked in a May 4 interview on\u00a0NBC's\u00a0\"Meet the Press\" whether higher duties on imports will drive up prices, he replied, \"No. I think tariffs are going to be great for us because it's going to make us rich.\"",
      "The president has also doubled down on his messaging that foreign exporters, not U.S. consumers, will absorb higher tariff costs. \"China probably will eat those tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said in an April 29\u00a0interview\u00a0with ABC News about the U.S. imposing tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese goods.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump has seemingly acknowledged that stepped-up tariffs could result in higher costs for some goods, such as toys. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said in an\u00a0April 30 Cabinet meeting. \"And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\"",
      "Some companies already hiking prices",
      "After Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on U.S. imports, along with higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of other nations, a flurry of companies across a range of industries have announced that they will increase prices to offset higher costs.",
      "For example, power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker said in an April 30 earnings\u00a0call that they implemented a \"single-digit\" price increase on retail partners that month and that they're eyeing another price increase for later in the year.",
      "\"Given the magnitude of the current tariff rates, we are actively engaged with our channel partners about a second price increase, targeting implementation at the beginning of the third quarter,\" Chief Operating Officer Christopher Nelson said on the call.",
      "The CEO of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide, Old Spice, Tampax and other household brands, told CNBC\u00a0last month that price hikes are \"likely\" due to the uncertainty of tariffs. Adidas CEO Bjorn Goulden also told analysts in an April earnings call that there will be price increases in the U.S. market if U.S. duties on imported goods remain in place.",
      "\"So should the duties go away, again, there will, of course, not be price increases,\" he said. \"But I think we all agree that should these duties stay or even be higher, then, of course, it will cause a price increase in the market in general, not only in our category.\"",
      "Chinese online retailers Shein and Temu said in April that they planned to hike their prices, citing the U.S. eliminating a tariff loophole\u00a0for lower-cost goods. Relatedly, Temu has stopped shipping Chinese-made goods to customers in the U.S. following the May 2 expiration of the so-called de minimis exemption.",

      "Because of the uncertainty of the economy's path under the Trump administration's trade policies, the central bank wants to take a wait-and-see approach, Powell added. At the benchmark rate's current level, the Fed has the flexibility to cut rates if unemployment rises, or hike rates if inflation reignites due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, he noted.",
      "At the same time, Powell noted there are concerns that the Fed could face a situation where its dual mandate is in tension, which could occur if inflation and unemployment simultaneously spike. In that scenario, the central bank would need to focus on which side of the mandate is the farthest from the Fed's goal, and prioritize taming that part of the economy, he added.",
      "\"This would be a complicated and challenging judgment we would have to make,\" Powell said. \"If the two goals are in tension \u2014 if unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way, and so is inflation \u2014 we would look at how far they are\" from the Fed's targets, and focus first on the economic issue that's under greater stress, he added.",
      "Wall Street interpreted Powell's comments as signaling an increased risk that the U.S. economy could slide into stagflation, or a combination of slower economic growth and higher inflation.",
      "\"The Fed still sees the economy on solid footing, but acknowledges upside risk to both sides of their mandate \u2014 unemployment and inflation \u2014 because of tariffs,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in an email. \"With stagflation risks rising, the Fed's communications will emphasize patience until there is enough clarity in the data.\"",
      "What the Fed decision means",
      "The Fed's to hold interest rates steady comes amid pressure from Mr. Trump to cut interest rates, with the president\u00a0writing\u00a0on social media last month that the central bank has been \"TOO LATE AND WRONG\" for holding off on further reductions.",
      "The latest Fed statement offers no clues on when it might consider easing monetary policy, according to Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"We continue to expect that, with tariffs likely to generate a modest slowdown in GDP growth to around 1.5%, the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged for all of this year,\" he said in a report.",
      "Economists are forecasting that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation later this year. That could provide the Fed with the impetus to cut rates, although inflation\u00a0cooled in March.",
      "Given more subdued inflation and a buoyant job market, most economists had\u00a0projected\u00a0that the Fed would maintain interest rates at today's meeting, despite some headwinds such as eroding\u00a0consumer confidence\u00a0and a sharp decline in\u00a0first-quarter\u00a0U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"For the time being the Fed remains in a holding pattern as it waits for uncertainty to clear,\" said Ashish Shah, CIO of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email after the Fed's announcement.",
      "Shah added, \"Recent better-than-feared jobs data has supported the Fed's on-hold stance, and the onus is on the labor market to weaken sufficiently to bring a resumption of its easing cycle.\"",

      "President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive film tax credit.",
      "\"California built the film industry \u2014 and we're ready to bring even more jobs home.  We've proven what strong state incentives can do,\" Newsom's post on X said. \"Now it's time for a real federal partnership to Make America Film Again.\"",
      "His request came after the president announced over the weekend that he would impose 100% tariffs on all films produced outside the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the nation's movie industry was \"DYING a very fast death.\"",
      "The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since\u00a0experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels.",
      "Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit\u00a0from $330 million to $750 million.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday. A day earlier, during a meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027, the president also talked about Newsom and Hollywood.",
      "He said the American film industry has been \"decimated\" by other countries and the \"grossly incompetent\" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to \"abandon\" the U.S. But he vowed that \"we'll get it back.\" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to \"make sure they're happy with\" the prospective tariffs.",
      "The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail\u00a0project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "\"A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?\" Mr. Trump said. \"That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage.",
      "\"And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,\" he said.",
      "He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California.",
      "\"I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,\"",
      "The president visited Los Angeles in late-January with the first lady, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. He was greeted by Newsom when he landed at the airport.",
      "\"I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor.",
      "\"I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Top advisers have sent President Trump a plan to create a government-run investment fund, a request the president made earlier this year \u2014 but the White House has rejected parts of the proposal, CBS News has learned.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to jointly develop a proposal for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund by early May.",
      "It has been submitted, multiple sources told CBS News on Wednesday. However, the White House had concerns about the approach taken by Treasury, one of the sources said.",
      "Details on the mechanics of the fund continue to be debated, and no announcement is imminent, one source said.",
      "\"In accordance with President Trump's executive order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments have formulated plans for a Sovereign Wealth Fund, but no final decisions have yet been made,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Administration remains committed to using every tool available to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard America's national and economic security.\"",

      "Mr. Trump has not determined how proceeds from the sovereign wealth fund would be spent, sources said. In the past, he has suggested the fund could own a stake in TikTok, the popular social media platform that faces a U.S. ban unless China-based parent company ByteDance divests from it.",
      "Sovereign wealth funds typically invest assets from a country's natural resources with an aim to make returns that would provide a public windfall. Some of the best-known funds are financed by revenue from gas or oil, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Norway's sovereign wealth fund. These funds can help insulate countries from swings in the value of natural resources, provide funds for government expenditures and allow future generations to benefit from current oil and gas revenue.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that directed the Treasury and Commerce secretaries, in close coordination with the National Economic Council's Kevin Hassett, to draft a plan for the sovereign wealth fund within 90 days.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-maha-food-box-replace-csfp-low-income-seniors/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 17:31:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has a new plan to get \"healthy\" food to low-income seniors, but an anti-hunger advocate fears many will miss out.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed budget for next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under the plan, funding for the program \u2014 called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \u2014 would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers.",
      "The food boxes \u2014 whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" \u2014 could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes.",
      "The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program.",
      "\"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes.",
      "The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget, according to the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA.",
      "\"We have no details\"",
      "The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit\u00a0in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans.",
      "Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said.",
      "\"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\"",
      "Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas.",
      "\"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store \u2014 it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\"",
      "The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut.",
      "But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "The Kennedy effect",
      "The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\"",
      "The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a 2021 analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes.",
      "MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop using\u00a0synthetic food dyes\u00a0and has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches.",
      "The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas to ban the use of food stamps for purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans.",
      "In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it.",
      "\"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance.",
      "The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins.",
      "Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday \"we need to start moving forward.\" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes.",
      "Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said the stablecoin bill advanced out of the committee with the caveat that improvements would be made before it was brought up for a floor vote. But Republicans moved ahead without addressing Democrats' concerns on provisions involving anti-money laundering, national security and consumer protections, Gallego said.",
      "\"I think the purpose of that was really to put Democrats in a bad position and try to force us to vote for it,\" Gallego told MeidasTouch in an interview posted Wednesday.",
      "\"You can't try to f*** us and then say, hey, deal with it,\" Gallego added. \"That's just not going to work, especially when you still need our votes.\"",
      "A few Republican senators \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Kennedy of Louisiana \u2014 have also indicated that they could vote against the bill for various other reasons.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures.",
      "\"Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,\" it says.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, \"Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption.\"",
      "The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets.",
      "\"Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,\" Merkley said in a statement. \"This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.\"",
      "The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act.",
      "On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's \"serious risks\" to the U.S. economy.",
      "The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole.",
      "The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024.",
      "In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\"",
      "\"Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,\" she said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the \"single largest-ever investment in a crypto company\" and sets a \"historic precedent.\" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment.",

      "The Trump administration plans to eliminate the Energy Star program, a 33-year-old energy efficiency certification for appliances such as refrigerators and dishwashers that has helped American consumers save more than $500 billion in energy costs, according to the program.",
      "The plan to eliminate Energy Star was announced at an Environmental Protection Agency meeting on Monday, where the agency showed a chart marking the program for closure as part of a reorganization effort, according to a document obtained by Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) committee and shared with CBS News. The news was earlier reported by CNN.",
      "The slides were also confirmed by a union representing government employees, which said the workers were told at the meeting that the Energy Star program would be eliminated.",
      "The EPA said it is reorganizing the agency, although it didn't specifically mention the Energy Star program. When asked in a follow-up question to confirm the Energy Star program is slated for elimination, the EPA didn't respond.",
      "\"The EPA is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback,\" the agency said in an email.",
      "Energy Star was created in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush with the idea of helping consumers save money while reducing energy consumption. Its blue stickers on appliances, inform shoppers that those products meet energy efficiency standards set by the EPA. During his first term, President Trump had sought to close the Energy Star program, but the effort was abandoned after pushback from appliance manufacturers and lawmakers in both parties.",
      "\"Trump claimed he'd lower prices on Day 1, but by eliminating this program, he will force Americans to buy appliances that cost more to run and waste more energy,\" said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island and the EPW ranking member, in an Tuesday email to CBS News.",
      "He added, \"It's yet another a giveaway to polluters and a raw deal for working families. This isn't economic policy, it's economic sabotage \u2014 sabotaging family budgets to pay off fossil fuel donors.\"",

The administration wants to boost fossil fuel and mineral extraction on U.S. lands, part of its goal to battle inflation.",
      "Appliances are part of that push. Mr. Trump has pledged to \"unleash America's affordable and reliable energy and natural resources,\" according to an executive order he signed in January, which ordered a review of \"restrictions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances.\"",

      "Do I need a Real ID to fly?",
      "The Transportation Security Administration said that starting Wednesday, it will no longer accept IDs that don't comply with Real ID requirements.",

      "The TSA said people without an acceptable ID may have to have their identity verified by providing information such as their name and current address. Passengers with confirmed identities may then be subjected to additional screening. People without confirmed identities won't be allowed to go through security.",
      "Last month, a source familiar with the procedure told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that the identity verification process is similar to what happens when people have their ID stolen on vacation.

    "story": [
      "The Kamler family, owner of Fairfield, New Jersey-based Kent International, has been in the bicycle business for four generations.",
      "\"When I joined the company in 1972, we had six employees, including both my parents and myself,\" former Kent International CEO Arnold Kamler told CBS News. \"And as of a few months ago we had over 200 employees.\"",
      "Arnold took over Kent International from his father. Now his son, Scott Kamler, is CEO. They sell about two million bikes per year in the U.S. and they're one of Walmart's biggest suppliers. But President Trump's plan for tariffs is throwing a wrench into their American dream.",
      "About 90% of Kent bikes are imported from China. The rest are assembled in the U.S. at their factory in South Carolina with parts from Asia. Kent had been paying 25% tariffs on bikes and bike parts coming from China since the first Trump administration. But under the tariffs implemented by Mr. Trump last month, a recent shipment that was delayed and arrived during the new tariff period forced the company to pay a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs.",
      "During the one-month period from March 20 to April 20, Kent Bikes paid $3.1 million in tariffs alone.",
      "Under the new tariffs, a bicycle wheel imported from China that would have previously cost between $10 and $12 increased to about $30, according to Arnold.",
      "He says that makes him feel \"really bad\" and \"angry.\"",
      "\"China is not paying these tariffs,\" Arnold said. \"We have an account with U.S. customs where they automatically deduct once a month, the import duty, from our account. And so, it's not only import duty, but these tariffs are deducted.\"",
      "The company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May.",
      "Even if tariffs against China are reduced by the Trump administration, there are dozens of other countries facing new tariffs. So trying to find other foreign vendors seems futile.",
      "\"We had already shifted some of our business, almost half our business, to several of the countries on that list,\" Kamler   said. \"And we're getting out of China and now we're still getting slammed. It's just completely unfair.\"",
      "Arnold indicates that fully manufacturing and assembling their bikes in the U.S. is not financially tenable from a cost-perspective.",
      "\"I can't even calculate that high,\" Kamler   said about what he thinks a bike would cost to produce here. \"I'll just tell you one quick story. There was a company that came to us a couple years ago. They wanted to make handlebars for us. Now we used to make our own handlebar for about a dollar-and- a-half, and we saved some money by buying it from Asia. And this company took three months to give me the quotation for a simple BMX handlebar. And the price came back at $12. I said, '$12? It's about 80 cents of steel. How could you be?' 'Well, there's a lot of work.' And I said, 'OK, thank you, you can lose my number.'

    "summary": "Many investments Mr. Trump claims credit for predate his return to office or are based on vague future pledges. Here's a fact check of his claims.",
    "story": [
      "After President Trump was pressed on rising consumer prices and slowing economic growth, he defended his tariff policies by claiming they had spurred record investment in the United States.",
      "\"I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on\u00a0NBC's Meet the Press that aired Sunday. \"If you look at other presidents, there's never been anything like that.\"",
      "He has also repeatedly claimed that he secured more investment in his first two months than President Biden did in four years.",
      "Neither claim is supported by evidence, CBS News Confirmed found. While companies have announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned investments since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the White House has not provided data showing the total approaches $9 trillion.",
      "Additionally, a CBS News review found that some investments highlighted by the White House were announced before Mr. Trump's reelection. The comparison to the Biden administration is also misleading: the president is citing future investments pledges, while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects that were in the works or completed by the end of his predecessor's term.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the claims.",
      "Some investments Trump claims credit for were announced under Biden",
      "The White House on April 29 said Mr. Trump had secured $5 trillion of U.S. investment in his first 100 days, and published a partial list titled \"The Trump Effect\" \u2014 which it said demonstrated \"his America First economic policies have sparked trillions of dollars in new investment.\"",
      "That list totals closer to $2 trillion from private companies, and around $5 trillion if commitments from foreign countries are included. The basis for the president's $9 trillion claim is unclear and the administration has not explained the discrepancy.",
      "A closer look at the White House list also shows some of the investments had been announced before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The list initially included a $4.1 billion commitment from Novelis, a Georgia-based aluminum company, to build a plant in southern Alabama. But construction for that project began in October 2022 and the $4.1 billion total investment was detailed in the company's February 2024 financial report. CBS News asked the White House on May 5 why the project was included; the administration did not answer the question, but by midday May 6 the project had been removed from the website.",
      "The Trump administration also claimed credit for a $1.5 billion pledge by Corning to invest in its solar products facility in Michigan. A company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that $900 million of this funding was announced months before Mr. Trump assumed office. On April 29, Corning announced an additional $600 million investment, bringing the total to $1.5 billion.",
      "Likewise, the White House listed Johnson & Johnson's commitment to spend $55 billion over the next four years, but a company spokesperson confirmed that total includes a $2 billion investment \u2014 announced last October \u2014 in a facility in Wilson, North Carolina.",
      "The list also includes the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative announced by Open AI and Japan-based Softbank on Jan. 21, which had been in development for at least a year before Mr. Trump's inauguration. The companies said $100 billion would be deployed \"immediately,\" but offered few specifics on how or where the money would be spent.",
      "Comparing to investments under Biden",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he attracted more investment in two months than Biden did in four years, suggesting he brought in trillions in a matter of weeks while casting doubt that the former president secured even $1 trillion during his term.",
      "But there's no clear evidence to support his claim. A White House spokesperson said the president was referring to a December 2024 report from the Biden White House, which said the private sector committed at least $1 trillion to clean energy and manufacturing projects during Biden's term.",
      "However, Biden's list of investments highlighted \"a selection of private-sector investments in 21st century industries\" including green energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, based on project announcements in specific locations or factories under construction. The data on Biden's \"Investing in America\" spreadsheet also showed projects that closely resemble some on Mr. Trump's list.",
      "By comparison, the Trump administration's list includes broader, less specific investment pledges across a variety of industries \u2014 many without clear timelines or locations.",
      "For example, Mr. Trump's list highlights Apple's recent $500 billion pledge to U.S. manufacturing and training. However, as previously reported by The Washington Post, Apple also announced a $430 billion investment early in Biden's term, including a North Carolina engineering hub that was paused in 2024, and the Biden administration's report does not include any Apple investments in its tally.",
      "However, experts caution that announcements about planned investments don't guarantee action.",
      "\"Companies often will make announcements to essentially curry favor with an incoming administration to show how committed they are to the United States,\" said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S. \"It's not unusual whether it was President Trump or President Biden or President Obama.\"",
      "Presidents from both parties have claimed credit for projects started under their predecessors. For instance, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced investments during Mr. Trump's first term, some of which contributed to the construction of manufacturing facilities highlighted by the Biden White House investment report.",
      "During his term, Biden signed major pieces of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which included $24 billion in tax credits to attract private investors in hopes of driving domestic manufacturing commitments.",
      "Such incentives may continue to fuel further projects during Mr. Trump's term, according to Nigro, provided they remain in place \u2014 but the long-term impact of federal policy, including under both Biden and Mr. Trump, may take years to assess.",
      "\"It's very hard to attach these new investments that have been announced as being tied directly to policies of the Trump administration. It's frankly just too early,\" Nigro said.",

      "Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.",
      "They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them \u2014 affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.",
      "Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said.",
      "It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\"",
      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.",
      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",
      "The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\"",
      "Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.",
      "Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\"",
      "Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.",
      "Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.",
      "The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. \"It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,\" he said.",

      "\"I too address the world's great powers by repeating the ever-present call 'never again war,'\" Leo said from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica to an estimated 100,000 people below.",
      "It was the first time that Leo had returned to the loggia since he first appeared to the world on Thursday evening following his remarkable election as pope, the first from the United States. Then too he delivered a message of peace.",
      "Leo was picking up the papal tradition of offering a Sunday blessing at noon, but with several twists. Whereas his predecessors delivered the greeting from the studio window of the Apostolic Palace, off to the side of the piazza, Leo went to the very center of the square and the heart of the church.",
      "He also offered a novelty by singing the Regina Caeli prayer, a Latin prayer said during the Easter season that past popes would usually just recite.",
      "He wore the simple white cassock of the papacy \u2014 not the formal red cape he wore on Thursday night \u2014 and had reverted back to wearing his silver pectoral cross. He had worn a more ornate one that contains the relics of St. Augustine and his mother, St. Monica, on Thursday night that had been given to him by his Augustinian religious order.",
      "Pope Leo, who was chosen Thursday to become the next pontiff, will be inaugurated at a mass in St Peter's Square next week. Leo, born in Chicago, is the first U.S.-born pope.",
      "\"Beloved Ukrainian people\"",
      "Leo quoted Pope Francis in denouncing the number of conflicts ravaging the globe today, saying it was a \"third world war in pieces.\"",
      "\"I carry in my heart the sufferings of the beloved Ukrainian people,\" he said. \"Let everything possible be done to achieve genuine, just and lasting peace as soon as possible.\"",
      "He called for the release of war prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children to their families, and welcomed the ceasefire between India and Pakistan.",
      "He also called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and for humanitarian relief to be provided to the \"exhausted civilian population and all hostages be freed.\"",
      "Leo also noted that Sunday was Mother's Day in many countries and wished all mothers, \"including those in heaven\" a Happy Mother's Day.",
      "The crowd, filled with marching bands in town for a special Jubilee weekend, erupted in cheers and music as the bells of St. Peter's Basilica tolled.",
      "Angela Gentile arrived in the square three hours early to be in place. Nonplussed that cardinals had elected yet another non-Italian pope, she said she was happy Leo came to the central balcony of the basilica, so the crowd could see him face-to-face. \"What's good for the Holy Spirit works for me,\" she said. \"I have trust.\"",
      "More than 50 pilgrims from Houston, Texas, were in the square, waving three large American flags. They were in Rome on a pre-planned Holy Year pilgrimage and said they were proud to be part of this historic occasion.",
      "\"Words cannot express my admiration and gratitude to God,\" said the Rev. Dominic Nguyen, who led the Vietnamese American group. He said he hoped the pope would be happy to see the Stars and Stripes but also Peruvian flags and all other countries, showing the universality of the church.",
      "Leo's Peruvian and Chicago roots",
      "Leo, the former Robert Prevost, spent most of his priestly life as a missionary then bishop in Peru, an experience he recalled on Thursday night in offering a special greeting to his former diocese in Chiclayo in Spanish.",
      "Bertha Santander of Peru had come five hours early to unfurl her huge Peruvian flag in the piazza, recalling the emotion of that night when the piazza erupted in cheers when Leo first appeared.",
      "\"It's such happiness,\" she said. \"Already when I heard the last name I started crying and when he addressed a greeting in Spanish I was a sea of tears,\" said the Peruvian woman who has lived in Italy for more than 40 years.",
      "Earlier Sunday, Leo celebrated a private Mass near the tomb of St. Peter with head of his Augustinian order, the Rev. Alejandro Moral Anton. The Mass occurred in the grottoes underneath St. Peter's, the traditional burial place of St. Peter, the apostle who is considered the be the first pope.",
      "The area, which is normally open to the public, also contains the tombs of past popes, including Pope Benedict XVI.",

    "story": [
      "Levittown, Pennsylvania \u2014 At a town hall Saturday in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona encouraged the Democratic party to return to its roots as the \"big tent\" party.",
      "\"What happened the last election is that we got so pure, and we kept so pure that we started kicking people out of the tent,\" Gallego said. \"It ends up there aren't enough people in the tent to win elections.\"",
      "Gallego cited podcast host Joe Rogan as an example of someone \"kicked out\" of the tent because his message did not completely align with the party's.",
      "\"I'm sure you guys heard like, 'Oh, well, the Democrats need to have their own Joe Rogan,'\" Gallego said. \"We had Joe Rogan. We canceled Joe Rogan years ago. Democrats don't want to admit this. We did, and then it was, became questionable whether we should go on Joe Rogan or not. We did this to ourselves.\"",
      "The first-term Democratic senator from Arizona touted his own success in a battleground state as an example of how Democratic candidates can win moving forward. Gallego defeated Republican Kari Lake in the Arizona Senate race last year by two points.",
      "\"I represent a state that has 330,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats,\" Gallego said. \"You have to get a lot of votes, and that means we're going to have to have alliances with people that we may not agree with 100% of the time, right?\"",
      "This success has fueled speculation that Gallego is considering running for president in 2028. He's one of a handful of Democrats making stops across the country, talking to voters, similar to Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",
      "\"Of course, I've thought of it, but I'm also, you know, about to\u2026 have my third kid coming June 12, and I don't want to get divorced, and I just became a US senator,\" Gallego told CBS News. \"I love my job, and I need to make sure I do both jobs well. That's not what I'm thinking about right now.",
      "When asked if he thinks it will take a moderate like him to win Pennsylvania in 2028, Gallego said it will take someone who is able to empathize with voters on issues impacting them.",
      "\"I think it's going to take someone that really understands what's going on. People were hurting in the last election. I think the Democrats messed up by not really focusing on that,\" Gallego said. \"This person is gonna be able to communicate that like, yeah, things are bad. The economy hurts. You're hurting, and I'm here to help you out.\"",
      "Gallego spoke in Bucks County, a key battleground area north of Philadelphia that President Trump flipped by a few hundred votes in 2024.",
      "Distrust and anger toward the Democratic party were palpable at the town hall when one participant asked Gallego how Democrats should change their messaging moving forward.",
      "\"People don't vote for a party, right? It's us that run as Democrats. We need to be the face of the party, and we need to be out there,\" Gallego said. \"The problem is that we are too effing safe all the time.\"",

      "Sensitive talks between U.S. and Chinese delegations over tariffs that threaten to upend the global economy ended after a day of prolonged negotiations and will resume Sunday, a source briefed on the meetings confirmed to CBS News.",
      "President Trump\u00a0posted on his social media\u00a0Saturday evening after the meetings concluded, saying \"great progress\" was made.",
      "\"A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business.\"",
      "There initially was no immediate indication whether any progress was made Saturday during the more than 10-hour meeting between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland. The talks, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff, have been shrouded in secrecy and neither side made comments to reporters on the way out.",
      "Based on Bessent's\u00a0interview with Fox News\u00a0last week, initial discussions were likely about \"de-escalation, not about the big trade deal.\" The Treasury secretary said the U.S. and China have \"shared interests\" because the sky-high tariffs imposed by both countries last month are not \"sustainable.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is also in Switzerland alongside Bessent for the talks.",
      "Several convoys of black vehicles left the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, which hosted the talks aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies. Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks took place.",
      "The talks were taking place in the sumptuous 18th-century \"Villa Saladin\" overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government.",
      "The hope is that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they've slapped on each other's goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "In an interview with\u00a0NBC News\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump claimed Chinese officials \"want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal.\" The president also said he expected to lower tariffs on China \"at some point.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese officials have said they are open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade, but\u00a0pushed the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0to drop its \"unilateral\" tariffs first.",
      "Mr. Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China\u00a0to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries' boycotting each other's products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Even before the talks began, Mr. Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \"80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\"The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\" she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \"It cannot just be words.\"",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has aggressively used tariffs as\u00a0his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example,\u00a0imposed a 10% tax on imports\u00a0from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that claimed China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These The allegations include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2014 such as China's subsidies \u2014 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn't come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China's tech policy now resumes.",
      "Mr. Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland on Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Mr. Trump last month\u00a0suspended plans\u00a0to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but warned he could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\"An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland's interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\" the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \"is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\"",
      "On Saturday, Bessent said trade talks with Switzerland were \"very productive,\" and he was \"optimistic about the speed of these negotiations,\" citing Mr. Trump's trade deal with the U.K. that's still being finalized.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 23:49:43 -0400",
    "summary": "A judge is blocking the Trump administration and Elon Musk's DOGE from carrying out sweeping layoffs at over a dozen agencies \u2014 at least for now.",
    "story": [
      "A judge temporarily barred the Trump administration from carrying out sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies late Friday, part of a massive federal cost-cutting drive led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of federal employee unions \u2014 are likely to show that the Trump administration's attempts to reorganize and downsize the federal government exceed its legal authority. Illston wrote that President Trump \"likely must request Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks.\"",
      "Illston's temporarily restraining order blocks a litany of federal agencies from taking any further steps to carry out a February executive order telling agencies to draw up plans for large-scale job cuts. The affected agencies \u2014 covering a wide swath of the government \u2014 can't continue laying off staff or put workers on administrative leave in order to comply with Mr. Trump's order. The order also blocks \"any further orders by DOGE to agencies to cut programs or staff\" in accordance with the executive order.",
      "The order will remain in effect for at least 14 days while the judge considers the case.",
      "It applies to DOGE and 20 federal agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget, the Social Security Administration and the departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, Veterans Affairs and more.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to dramatically reorganize the government and downsize the federal workforce \u2014 a gambit it argues is designed to cut bureaucratic bloat and save taxpayer money. But federal unions and Democratic lawmakers view the moves as unlawful and disruptive to public services. The effort is led by Musk, whose team at DOGE has become embedded in virtually every major federal agency.",
      "The administration has already laid off or offered buyouts to thousands of staff, often focusing on probationary workers who are relatively new to federal service. Plans for deeper cuts are in the works at some agencies.",
      "In February, the Office of Personnel Management \u2014 essentially the federal government's human resources arm \u2014 ordered government agencies to make plans for a \"significant reduction\" in the number of staff.",
      "The lawsuit that led to Friday's restraining order alleges these moves are an \"unconstitutional dismantling of the federal government by the President of the United States on a scale unprecedented in this country's history and in clear excess of his authority.\"",
      "The suit argues Mr. Trump doesn't have the power to reorganize and slash federal agencies without authorization from Congress.",
      "The lawsuit also argues DOGE, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management don't have the legal authority to order sweeping government-wide cuts.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed back, writing in legal filings that \"Congress has expressly authorized federal agencies to engage in [reductions-in-force] and has done so for nearly 150 years.\" It notes the Trump administration's executive orders and memos specifically said agencies' cost-cutting plans should follow the law, and argues the administration provided \"broad guidance\" rather than dictating specific layoffs.",
      "Illston largely sided with the plaintiffs Friday, writing they are likely to show Mr. Trump, DOGE, OMB and OPM exceeded their authority. The judge also said the plaintiffs presented evidence that agencies have made cuts \"at the direction of the President and his team,\" rather than treating the administration's memos as general guidance.",
      "The Trump administration's cost-cutting drive has run into several other lawsuits. In March, a federal judge ordered the administration to rehire thousands of probationary workers. The Supreme Court later paused that ruling\u00a0while the litigation plays out.",

    "summary": "Rumeysa Ozturk was taken into custody on March 25 after her student visa was revoked by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody Friday, hours after a judge ordered her to be freed on bail.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Sessions, who is presiding over the case, said at the conclusion of Friday's bail hearing that Ozturk raised \"very substantial\" and \"very significant\" claims that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when she was taken into custody following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa in March.",
      "\"Her continued detention cannot stand,\" he said.",
      "Ozturk was released by the government later Friday afternoon, one of her attorneys, Sonya Levitova, confirmed to CBS News.",
      "\"The government sent masked, plainclothes agents to kidnap R\u00fcmeysa off the street and lock her up for writing an op-ed. She has been a political prisoner for six weeks. Now that she's free and can resume her studies and rejoin her community at Tufts, we look forward to seeing the government in court to vindicate R\u00fcmeysa's rights in full,\" Levitova said in a statement.",
      "Ozturk was held at an immigration facility in Basile, Louisiana, where she was transferred after she was detained in Massachusetts. But the court said she can now return to her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, with no travel restrictions. The bail hearing in her challenge to her confinement came after a\u00a0federal appeals court ruled\u00a0Wednesday that the Trump administration had until May 14 to comply with a district court's order to transfer Ozturk to immigration custody in Vermont.",
      "Ozturk, who appeared remotely from Louisiana and testified before the court, was seen hugging her lawyer after Sessions delivered his decision from the bench.",
      "The Trump administration has said that the underlying justification for taking Ozturk's student visa away rested on an opinion piece she co-authored in the Tufts student newspaper last year about Israel's war with Hamas. But Sessions said Ozturk \"simply and purely\" was detained for \"the expression she made or shared in the op-ed.\"",
      "\"There has been no evidence that has been introduced by the government other than the op-ed. I mean, that literally is the case,\" Sessions said. \"There is no evidence here as to the motivation, absent the consideration of the op-ed.\"",
      "He told the court that creates a \"very significant, substantial claim that the op-ed \u2014 that is that the expression of one's opinion as ordinarily protected by the First Amendment \u2014 formed the basis of this particular detention.\"",
      "\"There is absolutely no evidence that she has engaged in violence or advocated violence,\" Sessions said. \"She has no criminal record. She has done nothing other than essentially attend her university and expand her contacts within the community in such a supportive way.\"",
      "Mike Rodman, a spokesperson for Tufts University, said in a statement that the school is \"pleased that the court has approved Rumeysa's request to be released on bail, and we look forward to welcoming her back to campus to resume her doctoral studies. As we have noted previously, Rumeysa is a student in good standing, and nothing in her co-authored op-ed of March 26, 2024, in The Tufts Daily student newspaper violated either the university's gatherings, protests, and demonstrations policy or its Declaration on Freedom of Expression. We hope that she is able to rejoin our community as soon as possible.\"",
      "In addition to hearing testimony from Ozturk, her lawyers also questioned her doctor, her adviser in the doctoral program at Tufts and an official with a Burlington, Vermont, organization that offered pretrial services to Ozturk if she is released. The government did not put forward any witnesses to provide testimony.",
      "During the proceedings, and while her doctor was testifying about Ozturk's asthma diagnosis, a lawyer appearing alongside her in Louisiana said Ozturk was suffering from an asthma attack, and she was briefly excused for 10 minutes.",
      "One of Ozturk's lawyers said that she would face \"significant health risks\" if she remained in detention and urged Sessions to immediately grant her bail.",
      "Allowing her to remain in custody shows that \"you can be detained thousands of miles from your home for more than six weeks for writing a single news article,\" her attorney told the court.",
      "Ozturk alleges that her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights. She is among several hundred international students attending American universities who have had their student visas revoked after they were accused of criticizing Israel or participating in pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses.",
      "Ozturk's attorneys said that an immigration judge denied bond for the Turkish national during a hearing last month after they asked an immigration judge to release her as her immigration case proceeds. Her lawyers said the Department of Homeland Security presented one document to support their opposition to Ozturk's bond request: a one-paragraph State Department memo revoking her student visa.",
      "The immigration judge, Ozturk's attorneys said, denied bond based on the \"untenable conclusion\" that she was \"both a flight risk and a danger to the community.\"",
      "Ozturk was taken into custody by masked, plainclothes immigration authorities outside her Somerville residence on March 25 after her student visa was revoked by the Trump administration. She was not informed about the revocation before she was detained, her lawyers said.",
      "As justification for her arrest and detention, the Department of Homeland Security and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Ozturk \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization,'\" according to court filings.",
      "Ozturk had co-authored an opinion piece that was published in the Tufts' student newspaper last year that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The op-ed did not mention Hamas.",
      "Tufts president Sunil Kumar submitted a declaration defending Ozturk and supporting her motion regarding her release, writing that the university \"has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "After Ozturk was taken into custody, she was transferred to New Hampshire and then Vermont, where she was kept overnight before putting her on a plane to Louisiana. The 30-year-old student has been detained at an immigration facility in Basile since late March.",
      "In a court filing by Ozturk, she said that she has suffered multiple serious asthma attacks in ICE detention and has received limited medical attention at the Louisiana detention center. She said that she is one of 24 people in a detention cell that has a sign stating the room has a capacity for 14.",
      "During Friday's bail hearing, Ozturk told the court that she has suffered 12 asthma attacks since she was detained, which have become \"longer and harder to stop.\" Four of them occurred since Ozturk disclosed her history to the court in a declaration last week, she said. There are \"constant triggers\" that can bring on an attack, including the room conditions at the facility in Louisiana, limited access to the outdoors and stress from her confinement, Ozturk said.",
      "\"It is affecting me in a very negative way, alongside other women living here, not accessing enough medical care and medication,\" she said.",
      "If she is released while her case is adjudicated, Tufts will provide Ozturk with housing, she said. Ozturk can continue working toward completion of her doctorate if she is let out of detainment, she told the court.",
      "Ozturk's whereabouts in the hours after she was taken into custody kicked off a battle over where her habeas petition should be filed and whether federal district courts even have the authority to consider the challenge. While initially filed in court in Massachusetts, a judge there transferred her case to Vermont, given that Ozturk was in the state at the time her lawyers filed her habeas petition.",
      "The Massachusetts judge who was assigned Ozturk's petition seeking release had swiftly issued an order barring the government from transferring her out of the state. But by then, Ozturk was in Vermont and hours later was flown to Louisiana.",
      "Referencing this initial order, Sessions called it an \"extraordinary situation\" in which a federal judge ordered the government not to take Ozturk out of Massachusetts, and then did not inform the court that she was in a different location.",
      "The Justice Department had argued that the case should proceed in Louisiana, as that is where Ozturk was confined. They had sought, unsuccessfully, to have her challenge to her detention tossed out.",
      "Sessions, who sits on the federal district court in Vermont, ruled last month that Ozturk had to be transferred from Louisiana to ICE custody in Vermont. Separate from her bail hearing, the judge will weigh the merits of Ozturk's challenge to her confinement on May 22.",
      "The Trump administration appealed that decision and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit to block it. But the three-judge panel rejected the request and said federal immigration authorities had to transfer Ozturk to Vermont, as Sessions ordered them to do.",
      "\"Permitting Ozturk's transfer will provide her ready access to legal and medical services, address concerns about the conditions of her confinement, and expedite resolution of this matter \u2014 all of which are required, as the court below noted, to proceed expeditiously,\" Judges Barrington Parker, Susan Carney and Alison Nathan said in their unanimous opinion. \"At stake, too, is Ozturk's ability to participate meaningfully in her habeas proceedings.\"",

In March, USAID leadership issued a memo saying the vast majority of the agency's employees would formally lose their jobs on either July 1 or Sept. 2.\u00a0 Employees have continued to be on USAID payroll since February.",
      "Later that month, the State Department notified Congress that it would \"realign select USAID functions to the Department\" by July 1.",

      "\"It's an effort to stifle anyone else from talking to the press,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"These notices smack of an administration desperate to hide their mistakes.\"",
      "Investigations into possible employee misconduct typically take months to resolve and involve multiple appeals. In most circumstances, if an employee is found to have committed misconduct, they are offered a limited suspension from work without pay.",
      "\"This is a complete waste of time and government resources,\" Chester said. \"It's going to cost them money to conduct these investigations, and the lawyers investigating won't even have jobs by the time it's done.\"",

      "The Trump administration is \"actively looking at\" the possibility of suspending the writ of habeas corpus to handle people the administration says aren't in the country legally, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Friday.",
      "A writ of habeas corpus requires authorities to produce in court an individual they are holding and justify their confinement. Article I of the Constitution says the \"privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\"",
      "Miller made the comments to reporters at the White House Friday when a journalist asked if President Trump is weighing the possibility of suspending habeas corpus to handle illegal immigration.",
      "\"Well, the Constitution is clear \u2014 and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land \u2014 that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion,\" Miller said. \"So it's an option we're actively looking at. Look, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.\"",
      "The Trump administration is fighting multiple lawsuits over its handling of undocumented immigrants, including migrants it flew to El Salvador for imprisonment. Mr. Trump has flouted the idea that all people suspected of being in the country illegally should receive hearings or trials, and has criticized federal courts and judges for getting in the way of the deportation process.",
      "\"We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years,\" the president said in a social media post in April.",
      "Lawyers for the Trump administration have previously cast illegal immigration as an invasion: The government deported undocumented immigrants to El Salvador using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law that allows for deportations when the United States is subject to an invasion by a foreign government.\u00a0 Some judges have pushed back on the argument.",
      "The writ of habeas corpus has been suspended only a handful of times in the U.S. and its territories since the Constitution was ratified. It was suspended across the states during the entire Civil War; in counties in South Carolina that were overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction; in specific places in the Philippines during an insurrection in 1905; and in Hawaii following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It has never been suspended in the U.S. to handle illegal immigration.",
      "Although habeas corpus is in the Constitution, it's a legal doctrine that dates back well beyond the country's founding. The term \"habeas corpus\" is Latin for \"you shall have the body,\" hence the requirement that the incarcerated person be physically brought before a judge in court.",

      "During his first all-hands meeting with agency personnel, acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator David Richardson issued a striking warning: \"Don't get in my way,\" the former United States Marine Corps ground combat officer told staff, according to a recording of the speech obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Obfuscation, delay, undermining,\" Richardson continued, referencing tactics he believed a fraction of FEMA staff might try to subvert his agenda. \"If you're one of those 20% of the people and you think those tactics and techniques are going to help you, they will not, because I will run right over you. I will achieve the president's intent.\"",
      "Richardson's formal title is Senior Official Performing the Duties of FEMA Administrator. He was named to the role Thursday and has not been formally nominated nor confirmed by the U.S. Senate.",
      "\"I can't recall the full title, but essentially, I'm acting,\" Richardson told staff on Friday, \"I don't need the full title. All I need is the authority from the president to put me in here as some degree of acting and I will make sure that his intent gets completed. I don't stop at yield signs,\" he continued.",
      "\"I, and I alone in FEMA, speak for FEMA,\" Richardson said.",
      "FEMA did not reply to a request for comment. When told about Richardson's meeting, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin responded, \"sounds like a productive first meeting.\"",
      "Richardson was appointed to lead FEMA after Cameron Hamilton, the former acting administrator, was fired Thursday morning, one day after publicly breaking with the Trump administration's expressed intent to eliminate the nation's disaster relief agency.",
      "\"I do not believe it is in the best interests of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency,\" Hamilton testified Tuesday before a House Appropriations Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. His dismissal comes roughly three weeks before the start of the Atlantic hurricane season.",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Friday that Hamilton was fired for testifying \"contrary to the president,\" presumably when he advocated for the nation's disaster relief agency not to be eliminated.",
      "President Trump said shortly after taking office that he planned to \"begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA, or maybe getting rid of FEMA,\" criticizing the agency for allegedly responding slowly to natural disasters.",
      "In his first address as acting head of the agency, Richardson doubled down on the president's promise to reduce its scope and carry out the will of Mr. Trump.",
      "\"I am as bent on achieving the President's intent as I was on making sure that I did my duty, where I took my Marines to Iraq, eleven of them,\" Richardson was recorded as telling FEMA employees.",
      "According to his official biography posted by the Department of Homeland Security, the former Marine commanded artillery units, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Richardson also taught history at George Washington University, strategy at the U.S. Army Field Artillery School, and Marine Corps Martial Arts.",
      "During his roughly 17-minute speech to FEMA employees, he recalled sending home a member of the Second Marine Division from Iraq. \"I had too important of a mission for anybody to undermine me or to make things difficult,\" Richardson said.",
      "\"We're going to find out how to push things down to the states,\" the acting leader later added. \"That should be done at the state level. Also going to find out how we can do more cost sharing with the states.\"",
      "During his address to FEMA employees, Richardson described his leadership style at length, noting that coworkers will rarely see him sitting behind his desk. \"Most of this time I will sit at the table drinking tea while I'm working out something with a stubby pencil,\" Richardson said, pointing a sharpened pencil into the air from behind a FEMA podium, according to the video of the recording.",
      "Richardson told FEMA employees, \"I have never read a book on leadership,\" but contended that, \"I'm fine operating in chaos and a very ambiguous environment.\"",
      "Toward the end of his remarks, the acting FEMA head referred all staff to two memos he authored in recent weeks, and distributed Friday morning. \"They're very short, but they will require almost all of you in this room input to some degree or another,\" Richardson said.",
      "According to the memos, obtained by CBS News, Richardson has directed staff to provide a slew of internal memos to him assessing FEMA's preparedness for 2025, as well as organization charts, watchdog reports and a list of all known gaps in the agency's preparedness or core capabilities.",
      "Richardson declined to take any questions from employees during his day one remarks, instead promising to host a town hall in the coming weeks so that employees could play, \"stump the chump.\"",
      "\"It's not that I'm afraid of questions, but I want you to read the memos,\" said Richardson.",
      "FEMA's new acting administrator said that he will begin his first day by \"looking at all the laws and statutes that guide FEMA and making sure that we are only doing the things that are within the law.\" He added, \"If we're not doing that, we are wasting the American taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "Reflecting on his time in the Marine Corps, Richardson paused for a moment. \"I've had friends who are either dead, physically or very damaged emotionally because they ran into trouble doing things that were not within their mission during combat. It's the same thing for a mission like FEMA.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-uk-deal-economy-10-percent-tariff-rate-risk-inflation/",
    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 17:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says a new U.S. trade pact with the U.K. can serve as the basis for more trade deals. Economists say that could be a problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday hailed his new trade pact with the U.K. as a \"maxed out deal\" that will serve as a template for agreements with other nations. But some experts are taking a dimmer view, noting that the U.K. agreement suggests high tariffs are set to remain in place for the long term.",
      "Although the deal with Britain offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports. Mr. Trump unveiled that baseline levy, which serves more broadly as a minimum import tax on other nations, as part of his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Friday that the president is \"committed to the 10% baseline tariff, not just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well.\"",
      "While a 10% tariff rate is lower than some import duties Mr. Trump imposed on other nations last month, ranging from a high of 145% for China to 11% for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it's still far higher than the effective tariff rate of 3% prior to the second Trump administration, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a nonpartisan policy think tank.",
      "Paring Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs to 10% could offer some relief for U.S. businesses and consumers facing higher costs. But it still represents a major headwind for importers, which pay the duties on goods and then pass on all or most of the cost to consumers, economists say.",
      "\"Even with a slow rollout of trade deals over the coming months, you're still going to have an effective average tariff rate that is going to be in the double-digit range,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What that means for businesses is that they're simply going to be paying more for the same goods that they have been importing, and they're going to be raising prices onto customers that have much less ability to withstand ongoing price increases.\"",
      "That, in turn, could cause Americans to tighten their wallets, a serious risk given that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 cents of every $1 in economic activity. Businesses that are stressed by tariffs could slow hiring, leading to a pullback in household income growth, Daco said.",
      "\"Modest improvement\"",
      "The deal with Britain is \"a modest improvement over what we had yesterday, but \u2014 with most U.S. tariffs still in place and very limited new U.K. liberalization \u2014 remains worse than the pre-Trump status quo,\" Scott Lincicome, Cato Institute vice president of economics, said in an email.",
      "The economic stakes for U.S. trade talks are high, with economists raising the chances of a recession due to fallout from Mr. Trump's trade war. The stock market tumbled and U.S. Treasury prices slid in the days immediately following the president's April 2 tariff announcement, underlining investor concerns that a trade war could torpedo economic growth.",
      "Stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the new\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0with the U.K.",
      "While Wall Street has largely rebounded since then on growing investor optimism that the Trump administration will soon strike new trade deals, many Americans are souring on Mr. Trump's policies. In a recent CBS News poll, 53% of those surveyed said they believe the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only 41% approved of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Even as the U.S. tries to negotiate additional trade agreements, businesses continue to face significant risks, economists note. These stem from the ongoing uncertainty over the ultimate level and duration of tariffs, making it hard for companies who depend on trade to make plans on spending, hiring and their supply chains.",
      "\"Even if this tariff is lower, this fundamental anxiety related to uncertainty and unpredictability\" remains,\" said Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"If this is not resolved or addressed, then I think it'll be difficult for consumers, investors and business to fully recover.\"",
      "Even so, some experts note that the Trump administration's efforts to strike new trade deals could provide some relief to investors and businesses, as long as there's growing clarity about where the tariff policies could settle.",
      "\"Now, at least the wheels are in motion relative to discussions with a variety of countries, with the deal between the United States and U.K. as perhaps indicative of the fact that there could be tariff and trade-related de-escalation \u2014 even without a fully drawn out trade agreement,\" noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration is \"focused on the big countries,\" although he added that negotiations could drag out.",
      "\"The president doesn't want to go fast,\" Lutnick said. \"He wants to do the kind of deal we did today, where we said, 'Look, this is just a win for America,' and we figured out how to make it a win for them.\"",
      "Key meeting with China",
      "The U.K. is a fairly modest trading partner for the U.S., representing about $65 billion in annual imports, or less than one-tenth of annual imports from China.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland, and Mr. Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on the nation's goods from its current 145% level.",
      "\"80% Tariff on China seems right!\" the president wrote\u00a0Friday morning.",
      "But that might not be enough to cushion the U.S. from the headwinds of higher tariffs, according to experts.",
      "\"Even if we were to see a continuation of the universal 10% tariff applied and some rollback of higher levels, or in the case of China, 145%, we're still talking about a tariff rate that is the highest since World War II,\" Luschini said. \"And so it's going to have an impact at some form.\"",

Turner in his letter said the company was using Gulf of America to follow \"longstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions.\"",
      "Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.",

      "\"While there's nothing unlawful per se about rushing to enact policy in the final days of a presidential administration (indeed, it's a time-honored tradition), executive branch officials may not circumvent clear legal requirements in the eleventh hour to achieve goals they couldn't accomplish in the normal course,\" a federal judge in California ruled in 2020.",

      "\"We anticipate that Mr. Steiner will join the organization in July, assuming his successful completion of the ethics and security clearance processes that are currently underway,\" McReynolds said.",
      "Friday's announcement by the the Board of Governors comes as President Trump and his adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have raised the idea of privatizing the nearly 250-year-old Postal Service, which has faced financial challenges amid a changing mail mix and other issues.",
      "The choice of Steiner has been seen by the postal unions as a harbinger for possible privatization of some or all of the venerable quasi-public institution, which is largely self-funded and has a mission to serve every address in the country \u2014 nearly 167 million residences, businesses and post office boxes.",
      "Postal unions have held protests throughout the country over potential privatization, job cuts and possibly ending the universal service obligation.",
      "Brian L. Renfroe, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said Steiner is not just any executive from the private sector but someone who sits on the board of one of the Postal Service's top competitors.",
      "\"His selection isn't just a conflict of interest \u2014 it's an aggressive step toward handing America's mail system over to corporate interests,\" Renfroe said in a statement. \"Private shippers have been waiting to get USPS out of parcel delivery for years. Steiner's selection is an open invitation to do just that.\"",
      "Renfroe's union represents 205,000 active city letter carriers and around 90,000 retirees.",
      "Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents more than 220,000 USPS employees and retirees, likened the appointment of Steiner to a fox guarding a hen house.",
      "\"FedEx has a very different agenda than the public postal service. And they're a major competitor of the United States Postal Service,\" he said. \"I'm not talking about any attributes of an individual, but to me, that's the last type of person you will put in charge of the public institution as the anchor of the mailing package industry in the country.\"",
      "Steiner, who will leave the FedEx board, said in a written statement that he admires the public service mission of the USPS and called it \"an incredible honor to be asked to lead the world's greatest postal organization.\"",
      "\"I believe strongly in maintaining its role as an independent establishment of the executive branch,\" said Steiner, who served as CEO of Waste Management Inc. from 2004 through October 2016.",
      "In a written statement, McReynolds called Steiner \"the right person to lead the Postal Service at this time to ensure this magnificent and historic organization thrives into the future.\"",
      "\"Dave is a highly regarded leader and executive with tremendous vision, experience and skill that can be applied to the long-term mission and business needs of the Postal Service,\" she added. \"Our Board looks forward to working with Dave as he takes on the core mandates of providing universal and excellent service for the American public and doing so in a financially sustainable manner.\"",
      "The Postal Service is in the midst of a 10-year modernization and cost-cutting plan that began in 2021 under Postmaster Louis DeJoy, who resigned in March. The plan is an attempt to stop losses at the agency, which has a budget of about $78 billion a year and is mostly self-funded, including through stamps and packages.",
      "Known as \"Deliver for America,\" the initiative has received markedly mixed reviews. While postal officials contend it has led to major efficiency improvements, some members of Congress have criticized it for leading to mail delays, unsustainable postage increases and declines in business.",
      "Besides privatization, there's also been talk of possibly moving the USPS under the control of the U.S. Department of Commerce.",
      "The choice of Steiner was first reported by The Washington Post.",

    "story": [
      "Trump administration funding cuts and a loss of federal workers who help support wildland firefighting continues to make planning for the upcoming wildfire season a challenge, according to forest and fire officials in Washington state and Oregon.",
      "The biggest issue they're facing is a lack of communication from the federal government as the West faces \"a pretty significant wildland fire season,\" Washington State Forester George Geissler said Thursday during a press conference hosted by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington and Jeff Merkley of Oregon.",
      "\"This is the time when we make certain that we have the aviation we need, when we have the personnel we need and that all of our systems check out and are ready to go when the alarm bell rings,\" he said. \"Without knowing what our partners are doing or not having a clear understanding of what actions are being taken, we struggle with missing the third leg of the stool that we have.\"",
      "The Forest Service workforce was cut in February during Elon Musk's push to reduce federal spending\u00a0as part of the Department of Government Efficiency, known as\u00a0DOGE. At least 1,000 National Park Service workers were let go. A court order to rehire fired workers, along with a public outcry brought many workers back to their jobs, but Murray and fire officials say it wasn't enough. Plus, the lost of experienced, trained workers set the process back.",
      "\"We're hearing that don't worry, we are going to hire frontline people,\" Murray said. \"You just let a whole bunch of frontline people go.\"",
      "\"Funding is not in jeopardy\"",
      "A spokesperson with the Department of Interior, which oversees National Parks and other public lands, said \"funding is not in jeopardy.\" They're supporting firefighting efforts by increasing pay for federal and tribal wildland firefighters across the U.S.",
      "The administration has refused to release the exact number of fired and rehired workers, but numbers are coming in from individual forests, she said.",
      "\"I've heard of at least 35 people at Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, 46 at Okanagan-Wenatchee, 21 at Colville, 15 at Gifford-Pinchot, and more at the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Olympic National Forest and Methow Valley,\" she said. \"Here's the thing, nearly every single Forest Service employee supports fire operations in some capacity.\"",
      "Fire Chief Leonard Johnson, with the McLane Black Fire Department in Washington state, said they may line up aviation support and heavy equipment, but it takes trained firefighters to put the fires out.",
      "\"We have a high reliance on that workforce out there,\" he said. \"Not only at the local level, at the state level, but at the federal level to make our wildfire season successful to deal with those large fires. People are the critical component in all of this.\"",
      "National Forest workers reduced by thousands",
      "Merkley said Trump's budget proposal cuts forest and watershed management programs that improve forest conditions, eliminates a collaborative forest landscape restoration program and slashes 2,000 National Forest positions, on top of the thousands who left through early retirement, buyouts and layoffs.",
      "Most of those workers may not have the title \"firefighter\" but they all hold Red Cards - which shows they have special training to provide essential frontline support to firefighting crews, Murray said.",
      "\"In fact, around three quarters of forest service workers are trained in wild land firefighting,\" she said. \"They provide crucial surge capacity when a crisis strikes.\"",
      "Trail maintenance crews ensure the paths are clear for firefighting personnel and equipment, Murray said. Biologists conduct testing to make decisions about prescribed burns and fuel reduction planning.",
      "\"We are here today to pull the fire alarm, and we're gonna set off some sirens,\" she said. \"We're going to keep focused on this, and we are gonna keep pushing back. There is just too much at stake to do anything less.\"",

    "summary": "The group of House and Senate Democrats say Trump's designation of Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations unlocks legal tools that will help address the flow of U.S.-made guns across the border with Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of House and Senate Democrats is urging top Trump administration officials to use the recent designation of Latin American cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations to take action to curtail the flow of American-made guns across the southern border.",
      "The 14 Democratic lawmakers said in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Attorney General Pam Bondi that the designation unlocks additional legal tools that would allow the administration to disrupt the cartels' financial networks and impose harsher penalties on entities that provide material support to them.",
      "Federal law makes it a crime, subject to fines and up to 20 years in prison, to knowingly provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization. Entities that provide weapons, money, equipment or other support to those groups can face federal prosecution if found liable.",
      "\"If you want to really tackle the fentanyl trade, you have to tackle the source of the power of the people who are involved in that trade, and there's no way to do that without addressing the guns that they receive from American-made manufacturers and dealers,\" Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who led the letter, told CBS News. \"It's a choice I would say, which is you can't actually successfully dismantle the cartels without also dismantling the gun trafficking that goes southward that allows them to send the fentanyl trafficking northward.\"",
      "The Democrats urged the Departments of Homeland Security, State and Justice to take \"immediate\" steps to stem the flow of firearms manufactured in the U.S. into Mexico by boosting interagency cooperation to dismantle smuggling rings that facilitate gun trafficking; expanding inspections at border crossings; increasing law enforcement efforts against straw purchased and gun dealers that provide material support to smugglers; and bolstering intelligence-sharing between the U.S. and Mexican authorities and other partners to target weapons traffickers.",
      "\"This steady supply of weapons coming in from the north has allowed these criminal organizations to gain control over fentanyl and human trafficking across the border and undermine Mexican law enforcement,\" they wrote in the letter. \"Put simply, if we do not stop the flow of American-made guns across the southern border to Mexico, we cannot stop the flow of fentanyl into our country over that same border.\"",
      "Goldman said the Justice Department should initiate investigations into gun makers and dealers to determine whether they're knowingly distributing and selling guns to drug cartels, either directly or through straw purchasers.",
      "\"The fact that there is an intermediary does not mean that there isn't a criminal conspiracy that they are a part of, and that the DOJ needs to use this new foreign terrorist organization-designation to apply more pressure on the gun industry to stop the flow of American guns to the cartels,\" he said.",
      "Between 200,000 to 500,000 American-made guns are trafficked into Mexico each year, a pipeline that's been called the \"iron river.\"\u00a0Nearly half of all firearms recovered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured in the U.S., according to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Mexico, meanwhile, has just one gun store in the country and stringent firearms laws.",
      "An investigation from CBS Reports exposed how Americans are helping Mexican drug cartels smuggle weapons across the U.S.-Mexico border. Guns are purchased by straw purchasers in the U.S., and a network of brokers and couriers then transport them across the border and into Mexico. U.S. intelligence documents and interviews with current and former federal officials revealed that the federal government has known about the weapons trafficked by cartels for years, but has done little to stop the networks that operate in the U.S..",
      "In an effort to combat the violence wrought by drug cartels, the Mexican government filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court in 2021 against seven of the biggest U.S. firearms manufacturers and one wholesaler. Mexico is seeking $10 billion in damages from the gun industry, as well as other forms of relief.",
      "Firearms manufacturers, though, are seeking to block the suit because of a federal law that shields them from liability for harms stemming from the criminal misuse of their products by another person. The Supreme Court is currently considering whether Mexico's suit can proceed, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sought to use the suit as leverage in trade negotiations with President Trump after his administration designated drug cartels as terrorist groups and threatened earlier this year to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican imports.",
      "Mr. Trump agreed in February to a 30-day pause on the tariffs on Mexican imports after speaking with Sheinbaum. Mexico's president said at the time that the U.S. government is \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "Goldman, who served as lead counsel in the first impeachment investigation of Mr. Trump before he was elected to Congress, said dismantling drug cartels to stop the trafficking of fentanyl and other drugs into the U.S. is a shared goal with the administration and should bring collaboration.",
      "\"One component of doing that has got to be stopping the Iron River streamline of American guns going into the cartel's hands,\" he said.",
      "Goldman introduced legislation in the last Congress that aimed to strengthen border security by curbing the trafficking of U.S.-made guns and ammunition across the southern border and said he is working to re-introduce the bill in the current Congress.",
      "Joining Goldman on the letter are: Senators Ben Ray Lujan and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, and Representatives Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Eric Swalwell of California, Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island, Lou Correa of California, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, Jill Tokuda of Hawaii, Nellie Pou of New Jersey, Timothy Kennedy of New York and Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico.",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 The strange reproductive habits of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail were once shrouded in mystery. Now, footage of the snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, the country's conservation agency said Wednesday.",
      "What looks like a tiny hen's egg is seen emerging from an opening below the head of the Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand.",
      "The video was taken at a facility on the South Island's West Coast, where conservation rangers attempting to save the species from extinction have cared for a population of the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades.",
      "The conditions in the containers mimic the alpine weather in their only former habitat - a remote mountain they were named for, on the West Coast of the South Island, that has been engulfed by mining.",
      "Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the creatures for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises.",
      "\"It's remarkable that in all the time we've spent caring for the snails, this is the first time we've seen one lay an egg,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites, which explains how the creatures can reproduce when encased in a hard shell. The invertebrate uses a genital pore on the right side of its body, just below the head, to simultaneously exchange sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg.",
      "Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity, after which it lays about five eggs a year. The egg can take more than a year to hatch.",
      "\"Some of our captive snails are between 25 and 30 years old,\" said Flanagan. \"They're polar opposites to the pest garden snail we introduced to New Zealand, which is like a weed, with thousands of offspring each year and a short life.\"",
      "The dozens of species and subspecies of Powelliphanta snails are only found in New Zealand, mostly in rugged forest and grassland settings where they're threatened by habitat loss.",
      "They're carnivores that slurp up earthworms like noodles and are some of the world's largest snails with oversized, distinctive shells in a range of rich earth colors and swirling patterns.",
      "The Powelliphanta augusta was the center of public uproar and legal proceedings in the early 2000s, when an energy company's plans to mine for coal threatened to destroy the snails' habitat.",
      "Some 4,000 were removed from the site and relocated, while 2,000 more were housed in chilled storage in the West Coast town of Hokitika to ensure the preservation of the species, which is slow to breed and doesn't adapt well to new habitats.",
      "In 2011, some 800 of the snails accidentally died in a Department of Conservation refrigerator with faulty temperature control.",
      "But the species' slow survival continues: In March this year, there were nearly 1,900 snails and nearly 2,200 eggs in captivity, the conservation agency said.",

      "To catch the meteors at their peak, NASA advises going outside around 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday. The moon will set by around 3 a.m., leaving skies dark until dawn.",
      "The shower will be viewable in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres but the conditions will be better in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Viewers should find an area away from lights, then lie on their backs with their feet facing east.",
      "NASA advises viewers should look away from the moon and give their eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the dark. Avoid looking at bright lights, such as a cellphone.",

      "Meteors in the Eta Aquariids come from space debris that originated from Halley's comet. Halley sheds a layer of ice and dust into space each time it returns to the inner solar system. The shed space dust forms two meteor showers a year: the Eta Aquarids in May and the Orionids in October.",

    "summary": "Bill Gates revealed his plan to give away virtually all of his wealth in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil and criticized the Trump administration's aid cuts. Here are some standout moments.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates is giving up his wealth for the health and wellness of millions, announcing exclusively on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday that he's committing $200 billion from the Gates Foundation to be spent over the next 20 years.",
      "Gates first revealed his plan to give away virtually all of his wealth in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" last week, saying he will take an \"equity, value-driven approach\" to the distribution of funds. It will go toward several causes, with a focus on global health and education. His ultimate goal: save tens of millions of lives, especially those of women and children suffering from HIV, malaria and other deadly illnesses.",
      "Here are some highlights from his discussion about his $200 billion mission, as well as what he calls his \"last chapter\" in life \u2014 and more.",
      "\"It's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do\"",
      "Gates said he won't miss the money, but he does hope he'll live long enough to see some of the positive ways it has helped hard-hit communities.",
      "\"I hope I'm still alive when we finish the 20 years, but I will save a little bit to be able to buy hamburgers \u2014 as much as I need,\" Gates joked.",
      "Some might be thinking, Why now? To Gates, it's simple: You can get more done by spending more money. That's why the Microsoft co-founder said he's \"doubling down.\"",
      "\"And after that, there will be other very wealthy people who can understand what the problems are, what's still left over,\" Gates said.",
      "\"And, in a way, it's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do,\" he added.",
      "More children will die due to aid cuts by Trump administration, Gates says",
      "As the U.S. and other European countries cut foreign aid budgets, health experts have voiced concerns about the implications for global health. In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March, marking a significant drop since 1990. Gates expects deaths could rise again, and it's something he wants to address.",
      "\"I will say, despite the challenges we have right now, which are huge and surprising, I'm very optimistic about the progress we can make over the next 20 years,\" Gates said. \"The next five, there will be setbacks because of these cutbacks, but we will get \u2013 and so the number 5 million might go up for a bit, which shouldn't happen. It's terrible. But, over time, we will get that number down even below 3 million.\"",
      "Gates urges U.S. leaders to consider the difference that maintaining foreign aid \u2014 roughly 1% of last year's federal budget\u00a0\u2014 can make.",
      "\"For 1%, if you can save lives for 1,000 times less than we save lives here, and if that creates stability in those countries, so they're thriving countries that will participate in the global economy,\" Gates explained. \"And we don't have to intervene with our military or anything, and the strategic relationship with them, where they see that we have helped them advance, and that that money is why you will be able to see a future pandemic early and stop it from spreading like COVID did all the way to the United States.\"",
      "Gates hopes the U.S. will follow his lead in helping some of the world's poorest nations, and said he will always advocate for governments to help.",
      "\"We never ask for more than 1% to go to helping the poorest. And I think cutting \u2014 when you're well below that 1%, cutting that I think \u2013 doesn't reflect the values I think we should stand for,\" said Gates, adding that the U.S. shouldn't cut money for vaccines or HIV medicines.",
      "Some of these topics came up during a three-hour dinner\u00a0between Gates and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in December. Gates said they had a \"great discussion\" about polio and\u00a0 innovations in HIV prevention and working together to get an \"HIV cure sooner.\"",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said.",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "\"I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities,\" said Gates, adding that the Gates Foundation can't replace U.S. assistance.",
      "In fiscal 2024, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, with $14.4 billion toward humanitarian assistance, the Pew Research Center reports, citing ForeignAssistance.gov.",
      "Gates fears foreign aid cuts could lead to even more childhood deaths due to a lack of vaccines and HIV medicines that prevent mothers from infecting their babies.",
      "\"Instead of [deaths] going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "The \"last chapter\" of Gates' career",
      "Gates is marking many significant milestones this year \u2014 the Gates Foundation turning 25 years old, Microsoft turning 50 and Gates himself turning 70.",
      "\"I'm stunned that I'm 70, because, when I was young, and I thought, hey, those old people don't\u2026 they're not very up to date on what's changing, what's important. And so here I am,\" said Gates, admitting that his \"Microsoft days were very intense.\"",
      "These days, he's spending his spare time playing pickleball and tennis, and reading. He also travels regularly to Africa and India as part of his work with the Gates Foundation, overseeing some of the programs he's partnered with to improve health and development.",
      "\"I get to travel and see the impact. And I'm not working. In my 20s, all I did was work,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he doesn't \"feel like a 70-year-old,\" but he wishes he had \"even more time.\"",
      "Toward the end of a letter he posted online Thursday explaining his decision to give away virtually all his wealth, Gates said he's beginning the \"last chapter\" of his career.",
      "\"And I hope I'm lucky enough that during the 20 years that we spend all of these resources that I will be able to both help guide it somewhat and see the work and make sure that others are going to step in to pick up whatever doesn't get done during these next 20 years,\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Part of Gates' motivation stems from the generosity of his good friend Warren Buffett, who has donated billions to the Gates Foundation over the past 19 years. Buffett, who is now 94 and announced this month he'll be\u00a0stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, made lifetime pledges two decades ago to five charities \u2014 including the Gates Foundation \u2014 that will continue until his death. At the time, it was the\u00a0largest philanthropic pledge in history.",
      "\"I should make sure that it's well spent. Warren Buffett's generosity, that's always \u2014 I have felt a huge responsibility to make sure his generosity is highly impactful. And now this is the last stage of all that,\" Gates added.",
      "What Gates hopes the world says about him in 100 years",
      "When asked what he hopes the world says about him 100 years from now, Gates said he has \"no interest\" in creating a lasting name for himself.",
      "\"If I cared about that, maybe I'd make the foundation a foundation that lasts forever. And other people choose to do that,\" Gates said. \"That's fine. I don't think that's the way to have the most impact. Most of the things I work on will no longer be problems.\"",
      "He hopes people a century from now will be puzzled by some of the diseases he's working to eradicate, like tuberculosis, measles and malaria.",
      "\"I think we will treat all children's lives as having value, because the world will be rich enough and the innovation of tools to let you do that will be so strong, you know, the childhood death number should be very small and not different between different countries,\" Gates said.",
      "AI is a \"very empowering tool\" for future generations",
      "Another tool that Gates believes could help: artificial intelligence.",
      "\"In a certain sense, it's going to be so novel that none of us are ready for it. But some of the aspects of it are incredibly positive,\" said Gates, who said he's seen firsthand how AI-powered teaching assistant Khanmigo, built by the nonprofit Khan Academy, is being used by math teachers in New Jersey.",
      "While AI can help foster curiosity and be a \"very empowering tool,\" Gates said kids will continue to forge their own paths based on their unique interests.",
      "\"Kids will choose what they're interested in. They don't all have to be AI scientists,\" he said.",
      "While some may voice concerns over AI being a motivation killer, Gates argues the opposite. It could give you more freedom and time to spend on things you're passionate about.",
      "\"Well, that's called the 'embarrassment of riches' problem, that you won't have to work the long hours that you work today. You won't have a shortage of doctors and huge waiting lists,\" said Gates, adding that he hopes AI will help support countries, like Africa, that are facing doctor shortages.",
      "\"Society will get to decide: how do you spend time? And how quickly that comes, you would get pretty broad disagreement, but, in general, that's where we're headed. And so \u2014 we will have more freedom. It's a lot better than things going backwards,\" he added.",

He says a total of $200 billion will go toward causes that will help save and improve lives around the world.",
      "\"By deciding to spend all this money in the next 20 years, we can get a lot more done,\" Gates said in an interview taped last week, days before he announced the initiative. He's confident the money will save \"tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "A change of plans",
      "It's a decision Gates did not take lightly, explaining in a letter posted online Thursday that he was inspired by a famous quote from Andrew Carnegie's 1889 essay \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" which argued \"the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\"",
      "Gates said his net worth, which is currently $108 billion, will drop 99% over the next two decades.",
      "\"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,\" Gates wrote.",
      "So, he changed his plans. The Gates Foundation, which was originally supposed to shutter decades after his and ex-wife Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045.",
      "The Gates Foundation, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, has already spent $100 billion to help cut the global childhood mortality rate by investing in medical innovations. Gates said he's seen firsthand how impactful the distribution of vaccines for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia can be. That's why he's determined to \"double down.\"",
      "He has three main goals: stopping the deaths of mothers and children from preventable causes, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and putting more countries on a path to prosperity \u2014 with a focus on improving education.",
      "Gates says more children could die due to Trump administration aid cuts",
      "But he's concerned progress could be stalled as the U.S. and European countries scale back on foreign aid and reduce humanitarian funding.",
      "In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March. Without substantial government assistance, Gates says that number will rise.",
      "\"So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to 4 million. And now with these cuts, if they're not reversed, we will go to over 6 million dying. So, instead of going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he's been in touch with President Trump and had a \"great discussion\" about some of his foundation's initiatives, including HIV prevention and polio, over dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December.",

In fiscal 2024 alone, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, according to the Pew Research Center, which cited ForeignAssistance.gov. The U.S. federal government spent four times more on global health than the Gates foundation, Gates said.",
      "\"You always want more money going into these things where you're saving lives for a few thousand dollars. And I will be an advocate for that,\" said Gates, praising global health initiatives spearheaded by former President George W.

As a new patient at 23, she may never have dreamed he'd allegedly watched her when she was just 14. And Ryan would do more than take out Sarah's teeth. Her family says he would take her self-control and eventually take her life.",
      "On the morning of Jan. 26, 2022, first responders could not revive Sarah after finding her unresponsive on the floor of the house where she lived with Ryan; following the surgery, the two had become romantically involved. Ryan told authorities he'd gone to bed about 10:30 p.m. the night before and discovered her in the morning. He told first responders Sarah had been struggling with drugs and mental health and he suspected an overdose. Authorities on the scene believed Dr. Ryan's account.",
      "But for a while Sarah's mother, Tina Harris, had been suspicious of Ryan. Tina Harris tells \"48 Hours\" contributor Nikki Battiste that Ryan admitted to her he'd noticed Sarah when he saw her in the park with friends when she was only 14. And Battiste learns from authorities that, when they started dating years later, Ryan had provided Sarah with access to the habit-forming drugs that eventually killed her. It's all in a report titled \"Depraved Heart Murder.\"\u00a0An encore of the broadcast airs Saturday, May 10 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Tina Harris says she knew Ryan was responsible for her daughter's death from the moment he'd called with the news that morning. She says Sarah had a history of depression and anxiety. Twice in the previous three months, she says she'd discovered Sarah with slurred speech and drug vials and medical paraphernalia nearby, which she'd instructed Sarah's sister Rachel to photograph. Tina Harris says Sarah and Ryan both had claimed he was merely hydrating her and they convinced Tina Harris not to notify police. But she says her suspicion about Sarah having been at risk was affirmed after her daughter's death when authorities discovered Sarah had two powerful surgical anesthetics in her system: propofol and ketamine, the latter of which is also used for depression and made news in the 2023 death of actor Matthew Perry.",
      "During and after high school, Sarah had been a good student, an aspiring model and a beauty pageant winner. She already had a boyfriend. But Tina Harris says Ryan didn't seem to care. She says soon after the medical procedure, his interest in Sarah became more overt. More than twice her age, he'd texted her with smiley face emojis, Tina Harris says, and offered Sarah a job as his surgical assistant. Interested in a medical career, she'd taken the job, and Tina Harris says around that Christmas, he'd left Sarah a diamond necklace in her locker. Ryan was divorced with three grown children and he already had a baby with one of his employees.",
      "\"I said, 'OK, he's after you,'\" said Tina Harris. \"You've gotta put your foot down.\"",
      "But Tina says in early 2021, Sarah agreed to have a meal with Ryan. Over the coming months, he wore Sarah down, says Tina Harris, by showering her with attention, gifts and travel \u2014 even paying travel expenses for the other Harrises too.",
      "\"You think he was grooming Sarah?\" asked Battiste.",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" Tina Harris responded. \"And \u2026 I think he was grooming me; I think he was grooming Rachel.\"",
      "They were all together on a trip to Key West in September 2021, when Tina Harris says a drunk Ryan revealed something to her and Rachel that made them instantly uncomfortable: that he'd noticed Sarah long before ever seeing her as a patient. Tina says Sarah had been just 14.",
      "\"'I used to see Sarah walking the neighborhood and playing at the park with her friends,' \" Tina Harris says Ryan told her one evening. She says he then added a reference to having thought Sarah was \"pretty.\"",
      "The conversation could not be independently corroborated, but Tina Harris says Ryan kept talking. \"'I found out she worked in the toy store across the street at this little shopping area,'\" she says he told her. \"'So I would take my kids there so I could see her and I remember when she dressed up as Elsa from 'Frozen' and she looked just like Elsa.'\"",
      "According to Tina Harris, Ryan later discovered Sarah had a waitressing job.",
      "\"'Then I found out she worked at one of these restaurants\u2026and so I would go in there for dinner so I could get her as my server,'\" she says Ryan told her.",
      "\"It sounds like Dr. Ryan was obsessed with Sarah,\" Battiste observed.",
      "\"He was. He was very much so,\" Tina Harris said.",
      "Tina Harris says she shared her concerns with Detective Ian Iacoviello of Montgomery County Police weeks after Sarah's death. The specialist in pharmaceutical cases was nearing his 2023 retirement, but first made a case against James Ryan with prosecutors, who charged and tried him.",
      "\"I can't imagine as a parent hearing another grown man say that they were watching my child,\" Iacoviello told us. \"There is a problem, um, an infatuation, a \u2014 almost a control aspect.\"",
      "During and after Ryan's initial courtship of Sarah, authorities say he had brought her drugs that he'd removed from his office and controlled her, as evidenced in a slew of texts between them, unearthed by Rachel Harris after her sister Sarah's death.",
      "On Feb. 11, 2021 Ryan wrote: \u00a0\"I can give you an injection \u2026 the anxiety will be completely gone in 6 second s (sic) \u2026 it will work. Let's try it\u2026\" In October, Sarah is asking for the drugs, writing: \"Do we have Ketamine here \u2026\" In November: \"We need syringes \u2026 I feel like s***.\" In December: \"I just really need \u2026 sleep xan (sic) you bring propofol \u2026\"",
      "\"He's created an addict,\" said Iacoviello.",
      "And in at least one case, Ryan appears to have actually administered the drugs to Sarah himself. On \u00a0Dec. 20, 2021, he'd written\u00a0 \"If you wake up \u2026 I just went to change, after I gave you Ketamine just now \u2026\"",
      "\"He's injecting her while she's asleep,\" Iacoviello told \"48 Hours.\" \"No monitoring, no anything.\"",
      "\"She was chemically dependent on him,\" said social worker Janice Miller, who had testified on behalf of the prosecution at Ryan's trial. From the witness box, Miller had told jurors that dysfunctional relationships can be caused by imbalances, in which one side seeks power over the other and then uses that power for control. And Miller told Battiste that, though she'd never met Ryan, his behavior fit the pattern of an abusive partner and as such, his need for control over Sarah Harris could have started years earlier.",
      "\"If Dr. Ryan was attracted to Ms. Harris when she was still a teenager, uh \u2026 he didn't really view her as a person,\" she said in an interview with \"48 Hours.\" \"He viewed her as an object \u2026 not a person to be in an equal relationship with. And so, if that's true, then he entered into that relationship not with the idea that they could have an equal relationship, but that he could control her.\"",
      "Ryan may have wanted to control Sarah, but prosecutors making a case against him faced a challenge. They had no conclusive evidence he wanted her to die. So they charged him with drug distribution, intent to distribute and a very uncommon type of murder.",
      "What is \"depraved heart murder\"?",
      "It's known as \"depraved heart murder.\"",
      "They told us it's a subcategory of second-degree murder \u2014 more serious than manslaughter, in which the state must show the defendant has a reckless disregard for human life. Maryland Assistant State's Attorney James Dietrich gave \"48 Hours\" an example:",
      "\"If I ... take a gun and just randomly shoot it into a crowd,\" Dietrich says, \"I may not necessarily want or care that anybody dies. But\u2026that is such a grossly reckless act that someone's likely to die.\"",
      "And Dietrich says Dr. Ryan's medical training meant he had to know the risks of those drugs he was bringing to Sarah Harris.",
      "Ryan's alleged comments about Sarah at 14 never came up at trial, where the defense team argued that when Ryan and Sarah met as adults, he only wanted to help her and that her own battle with drugs and depression may have played a role in her demise. But, having considered the incriminating texts and photos Rachel had taken at Sarah's house, it took a jury less than three hours to reach a guilty verdict on all the charges.",
      "And James Ryan is not the only doctor to face drug charges in a fatal overdose. Just last summer, federal prosecutors charged two physicians with conspiracy to distribute ketamine in the Matthew Perry case.",
      "At the Ryan sentencing on Jan, 3, 2024, Ryan addressed the court before the judge gave him 45 years in prison.",
      "\"While I did not administer the drugs to Sarah, and I'm not exactly sure when she got them, those drugs were absolutely my responsibility,\" Ryan said. \"And I should have made sure that she never had access to them\u2026I should have never thought I could control her addiction \u2026\"",

      "Tina Harris: He wanted it to look like it was a suicide.",
      "Tina Harris had long held suspicions about Dr. Ryan. He had encountered Sarah Harris more than a year earlier \u2014 not as a girlfriend, but as a patient to get her wisdom teeth out.",
      "Mary Fulginiti is a former prosecutor and defense attorney and a CBS News consultant. \"48 Hours\" asked her to use her decades of courtroom experience to help analyze this case.",

      "Tina Harris: He said, \"no, I don't need your resume. \u2026 just come on in for a working interview.\" \u2026 I said, \"well, I'm proud of you, honey. That's pretty incredible. \u2026 that he's gonna teach you all this stuff.\"",
      "At the beginning, Sarah seemed to love the job, but Tina Harris says as the holidays approached, an extravagant gift \u2013 a diamond necklace \u2014 retriggered her suspicion that Ryan's interest in Sarah was more than professional.",

Please don't do that.\" She's begging me \u2026 I grabbed her arms and I pulled her sleeves up, and she had needle marks from here to here (moves her hand from her wrist to her elbow), all over her arms, bruises \u2026 I became hysterical.",

      "PROSECUTOR JENNIFER HARRISON (in court): He was stealing dangerous sedation drugs from his business and administering them to his girlfriend Sarah Harris.",
      "Prosecutors say the proof of Ryan's guilt is largely in those text messages: Ryan offering to get rid of Sarah's anxiety in six seconds, telling her he gave her ketamine while she was sleeping, and on the night before her body was found, apparently agreeing to bring ketamine home to her.",

    "summary": "When C.C. Opanowski of Hudson Falls, New York, was a teenager, she survived a terrifying attack at the hands of her ex-boyfriend, Shawn Doyle. Years later, he would kill Lori Leonard, a mother of two young sons in Chittenango, New York.",
    "story": [
      "On Jan. 27, 1996, C.C. Opanowski was home alone from college in Hudson Falls, New York, house-sitting for her mother when her ex-boyfriend, Shawn Doyle, knocked on the door. Opanowski had grown up with Doyle and dated him in high school and into her freshman year of college.",
      "Once inside, Opanowski says Doyle became violent. \"He pushed me onto the couch, started holding me down, restraining me, yelling at me. And he picked me up and pushed me against the French doors,\" she says. Then, she said, Doyle took scissors and cut off her ponytail. \"He picked me up, held me up and cut off my hair, just all of it.\"",
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Anne-Marie Green asks Opanowski, \"What was it like to have your hair cut off in this way?\" Opanowski answers, \"Demeaning.\" Green continues, \"You think that is why he did it?\" Opanowski answers, \"Probably. Just to make sure he could knock me down somewhere.\"",
      "Opanowski says Doyle had gone in and out of violent rages, and at one point, he held scissors to her throat. \"I thought he was gonna stab me,\" she tells Green.",
      "For the first time, Opanowski shares her powerful story with \"48 Hours,\" speaking out about the attack, her long road to healing, and the strength it took to face her attacker in court.\u00a0 Green reports on a case that spans nearly three decades in \"Facing a Monster,\" now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Opanowski says she didn't think she would make it out alive until her college roommate and close friend, Shannon McCauliffe, called. Doyle allowed Opanowski to answer the phone, but she says he was watching her every move. \"And by the grace of God, just within a few words, she (Shannon) figures out, based on the tone of my voice and how I'm answering her, that he's there,\" says Opanowski.",
      "McCauliffe knew Doyle had a history of harassing Opanowski and feared for her friend's safety. She hung up the phone and immediately called police. When authorities arrived, Opanowski was initially relieved. But she says Hudson Falls police officers \"did not put him (Doyle) in handcuffs \u2026 They put us in the back of the same police car.\" To make matters worse, when they arrived at the police station, instead of separating them, she says police interviewed them together. Opanowski says she felt the police did not take the matter seriously. \"They made it seem like it was some fight between two young kids, that turned, slightly dark,\" she tells Green.",
      "When \"48 Hours\" reached out to the Hudson Falls Police Department, they acknowledged that law enforcement's response to domestic violence has evolved over the past several decades to better work with and support victims. Police arrested Doyle and charged him with menacing, harassment and trespassing. He would eventually plead guilty to menacing in the second degree and he was sentenced to three years' probation. Opanowski says she was terrified of Doyle. She transferred colleges and moved far away from Hudson Falls.",
      "Opanowski had put her past behind her until the summer of 2005 \u2014 nine years after the attack \u2014 when she learned that Doyle had been arrested for murdering 33-year-old Lori Leonard, a young mother of two boys. Opanowski says, \"I couldn't believe what I was hearing \u2026 I felt for her entire family and her two young children.\"",
      "Lori Leonard had met Doyle in 2003 on the dating website Cupid.com. She lived three hours from Doyle in Chittenango, New York, a small town outside Syracuse. Lori Leonard's older sister, Jennifer Leonard, says they only dated a short time because of Doyle's violent temper. Jennifer Leonard says, \"I had called her one night, and he was over there, and all I could hear in the background was him yelling at her. And that was like, what is this?\"",
      "Despite being broken up, Lori Leonard told Jennifer Leonard that they agreed to be friends and that Doyle was fine with it. Jennifer Leonard says she was skeptical. \"And I was like, no, he is not. Nope. People like that aren't just OK with being friends,\" she says.",
      "On April 29, 2005, just days before Lori Leonard disappeared, Shawn Doyle helped her move into a new rental apartment. Doyle had offered up use of his truck. Jennifer Leonard says, \"She had asked a couple people before that. So he was a last resort. He was still playing the 'I'm your friend.'\" According to Jennifer Leonard, the move went smoothly, except for the fact that Doyle decided to hang around. She said his presence was getting on her sister's nerves. But five days later, on May 4, Lori Leonard told her Doyle was finally leaving. Lori Leonard had plans to drive to Albany that day to pick up Yankees tickets from someone she met at work. Later in the afternoon on May 4, Jennifer Leonard called her sister, hoping to catch her on her way to Albany. Instead, Lori Leonard's phone kept going to voicemail. Jennifer Leonard says she thought that was weird. She says, \"Her phone never went straight to voicemail. It was never off.\"",
      "Twenty-four hours later, when Lori Leonard never called or returned home, Jennifer Leonard called the Chittenango Police Department. Detective Wade Irwin searched her rental property. There were no signs of a break-in or that a crime had been committed in the home. He said when they interviewed the man Lori Leonard was supposed to meet to get Yankees tickets from, his alibi checked out. When they interviewed Doyle, Irwin says, \"he just always, had said all along \u2026 that he left her, and she was alive at the apartment.\"",
      "Irwin says when they checked out his alibi they couldn't clear him. Yet, Doyle was cooperative and even allowed investigators to search his truck and take photos. When they searched Doyle's glove compartment, they found something curious: a key with a serial number on it. At the time it did not mean anything to investigators. But it would later become important to the case.",
      "On July 24, 2005, three months after Lori Leonard went missing, there was a break in the case. Lori Leonard's body was discovered in a metal toolbox found in the Lake Champlain Canal. Irwin says, \"She was handcuffed behind her back. There was duct tape around the handcuffs. Her feet were bound together, and duct taped. Her face, from head to chin had duct tape. And then once that duct tape was removed there was a bandana tied to her mouth.\" Irwin says the investigation quickly came together and it all led to Shawn Doyle. The key they found in Doyle's glove compartment matched the lock of the toolbox, tying him directly to the crime. When investigators searched Doyle's residence, Irwin says they found \"similar handcuffs, bandanas, duct tape and other means that he used that matched what was used on Lori.\" One day after discovering Lori Leonard's body, Doyle was arrested and charged with second-degree murder.",
      "On Jan. 23, 2006, Doyle's trial began. Washington County District Attorney Kevin Kortright says central to his case was getting Opanowski to testify. He says her testimony was important because \"it shows what he (Doyle) is capable of \u2026 it's his modus operandi. It's strong proof.\" \u00a0But Opanowski was not the only ex-girlfriend that Doyle had attacked. Five years after Doyle attacked Opanowski he allegedly tried to kill another young woman. The judge ruled both women could take the stand. Kortright says he chose to call Opanowski as his last witness.\u00a0 He says, \"You always put the best for the last.\"",
      "Opanowski bravely faced her attacker after so many years and told the jury about the long-lasting mental anguish Doyle caused her. She says she was determined. \"I need to make sure that he is put away for murdering Lori,\" she says. On Jan. 26, 2006, the jury came back with a verdict: Shawn Doyle was found guilty of second-degree murder.",
      "Opanowski says after all these years, it's still difficult to process the fact that a person she once loved was convicted of murder. She hopes that others can learn from her story. She says, \"Be vigilant. Look at what's happening in front of you and make sure someone knows. Don't keep it quiet. Pay attention and when you have that feeling, that one that doesn't go away, you know, the one that you try to push down, that's the one you should listen to the most.\"",

      "Shannon McCauliffe: I called her back a half an hour later, she still didn't answer. \u2026 and that's when my eyebrows kind of went up.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: I'm in complete shock. I can't believe it's happening and I have to figure out how to get out of it. \u2026But during this time, the phone continues to ring.",
      "Shannon McCauliffe: I waited a couple minutes and I called her back.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: I explained to him \u2026 if I don't answer this phone, my mother will call the police. \u2026 So I do pick up the phone and it's Shannon.",
      "Shannon McCauliffe: I said, \"hey, are you OK?\"",

      "A SURVIVOR SHARES HER STORY",
      "It has taken almost 30 years for C.C. to talk publicly about the day her former high school boyfriend, Shawn Doyle, attacked her in her family's home in Hudson Falls, New York, and then used scissors to cut off her ponytail.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: What was it like to have your hair cut off in this way?",
      "C.C. Opanowski: Demeaning.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Demeaning. You think that's why he did it?",
      "C.C. Opanowski: Probably. Just to make sure he could knock me down somewhere.",
      "On that day, as Doyle went in and out of violent rages \u2014 at one point holding the scissors to her throat \u2014 C.C. says she wasn't sure she would make it out alive. Until, she says, McCauliffe called.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: When she finally picks up the phone \u2026 what did you hear in her voice?",
      "Shannon McCauliffe: Fear.",
      "McCauliffe says she knew that Doyle had been harassing C.C., so when C.C. told her Doyle was there, Shannon notified police and then rushed over to C.C.'s house.",
      "Shannon McCauliffe: I pulled onto her street and I parked and then I saw the \u2013 the \u2014 the police officers and everything. \u2026 so I kinda went in after the fact. \u2026 She looked terrified and angry and sad.",
      "C.C. says she thought when police arrived, they would make her feel safe. But that's not exactly what happened.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: They do not put him in handcuffs. \u2026 And they put us in the back of the same police car.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: Mind you, all of this time \u2026 I clearly look like I've been assaulted. My hair is completely cut off.",
      "And when they arrived at the police station \u2014",
      "C.C. Opanowski: \u00a0I was like, why \u2014 why are we here? Why is he not \u2014 why are we in the same room?",
      "C.C. says instead of separating them, police questioned them together.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: And they made it seem like it was some fight between two young kids, that turned, you know, slightly dark.",
      "When \"48 Hours\" reached out to the Hudson Falls Police Department, they acknowledged that law enforcement's response to domestic violence has evolved over the past several decades to better work with and support victims. Police arrested Doyle and charged him with menacing, harassment and trespassing.",

      "C.C. Opanowski and Shawn Doyle grew up in the small town of Hudson Falls located in upstate New York.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: He was nice to me. He was really nice.",
      "When C.C. started dating Shawn Doyle, she was just 15 years old \u2014 a sophomore in high school. Doyle was one year older.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: You know, we would go out and do lots of things together. We just hung out all the time.",
      "C.C. says Doyle had troubles at home. During his junior year, Doyle told her his parents kicked him out. So, C.C. begged her parents to let him move in with them.",
      "Anne Marie Green: Did you feel sorry for him?",
      "C.C. Opanowski: Def \u2014 oh definitely.",
      "Soon after he moved into C.C.'s family home, she says she saw a change in Doyle's behavior. C.C. says he became jealous and would secretly follow her around \u2014 something she says she didn't think at the time was a big deal.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: When you're a 16-, 17-year-old girl and you know you're looking at, oh, jealousy, you know, he must love me so much and that's why he's doing this. Or he followed me home, he's so worried about me, but is that really what the case is? When you look back as an adult, someone with experience, you know, you think. That's probably not \u2014 not OK.",
      "And Doyle showed even more possessive behavior that C.C. found troubling.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: He at one point did get a tattoo. \u2026 It was a heart on his arm. \u2026 And it had my name in the middle.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: What did you say?",
      "C.C. Opanowski: Why would you do that?",
      "Anne-Marie Green: And his response?",
      "C.C. Opanowski:\u00a0 I love you.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Was it a red flag?",
      "C.C. Opanowski: Definitely.",
      "During his senior year, C.C. says Doyle dropped out of high school and was working odd jobs that he couldn't keep.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: And this is where things start to get \u2026 darker. You know, he \u2014 he doesn't have any prospects. He knows that I'm getting ready to go away to school. And to him, his whole life is \u2014 is about to completely change.",
      "But C.C. says she stuck by him, writing in her senior yearbook, \"I love you Shawn!\" And in the summer of 1995, when she left to attend what is now Russell Sage College in Albany, they agreed to stay together and see each other on weekends.",
      "But at the end of September, things took a scary turn when C.C. told Doyle she would not be coming home every weekend to see him. Doyle showed up at her dorm.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: He stood outside, basically threatening that he was going to kill me.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: And now he's threatening not just you, but anyone around you.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: Basically anyone around me \u2026 so he was arrested.",
      "Doyle was charged with harassment and trespassing. It was the final straw for C.C., who says she broke it off with Doyle for good and he moved out of her parent's house. Later that winter, that's when Doyle showed up and viciously attacked her at her home.",
      "Anne Marie Green: I know he threatened a lot, but did you ever believe that Shawn Doyle would have physically hurt you?",
      "C.C. Opanowski: Not until that day, not in that way.",
      "After the attack, C.C. returned to college and finished up her freshman year. But McCauliffe says her friend had changed.",
      "Shannon McCauliffe: I think it had a profound impact on her life.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: You know, I was always looking over my shoulder \u2026 I bought myself a Swiss Army knife. \u2026 I'm having night terrors. \u2026 You know, waking up crying, waking up screaming, not being able to sleep. \u2026 awful, awful.",
      "So eight months after the attack, when it was time to take the case to trial, C.C. \u2014 who was still just a teenager at 19 years old \u2014 told prosecutors she couldn't go through with it. She says she was too traumatized and scared.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: I didn't wanna have to face him in court. I didn't wanna be going over this over and over and over again. I really wanted it to go away.",
      "Doyle was offered a deal. He pleaded guilty to menacing in the second degree and was sentenced to just three years' probation. C.C. transferred colleges and moved hours away from Hudson Falls.",
      "C.C. Opanowski:\u00a0 I needed peace and I didn't know how to get it.",
      "C.C. tried to forget her past, but she says she was haunted by a conversation she had with the prosecutor.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: She said, you know \u2026 based on what I see here, he is going to do this again to another person. And that has for the past 28 years stuck in my head.",

      "Nine years after C.C. Opanowski left upstate New York for a new life far away from Shawn Doyle, 33-year-old Lori Leonard disappeared.",
      "Lori was a single mom who lived with her two sons, Austin, who was 9 at the time, and Zackary 5, in Chittenango, a small town outside Syracuse, New York.",
      "Austin Feltrinelli: She was a \u2014 a very caring mother. The memories of her \u2014 just us always being happy together, spending time \u2026 kind of always \u2026 the three of us.",
      "Zackary Wicklund: It was just a lot of love and affection.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: Her dream was to have a home, a father figure for her kids, and for them to be happy. \u2026 She wanted the white picket fence.",
      "Jennifer Leonard was Lori's older sister.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: We were good friends. But I was a little bit of a bossy mother to her. \u2026 I had been through a lot of things already in my life and my relationships, and I was very, I would say, overprotective.",
      "In 2003, Lori met a man on the dating website Cupid.com. His name? Shawn Doyle. Online dating was new back then, so Jennifer was skeptical about him.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: He was not charismatic. He was not social. \u2026 He was like a piece of furniture that you just walked around.",
      "But she says Lori didn't agree; she only saw the good in people.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: She would say, you know, he's misunderstood or he's shy.",
      "Jennifer says Lori told her very little about Doyle, except that he lived three hours away in Hudson Falls and worked at an ice cream factory. She also mentioned that Doyle was on probation.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: She told me that he was a boxer, that he was protecting a woman at a bar and was arrested because he used some of his professional boxing moves.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Did you ever see any sort of evidence of his professional boxing?",
      "Jennifer Leonard: No.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: I mean, did he \u2014 do you think he was even a boxer, ever?",
      "Jennifer Leonard: No. \u2026 I didn't buy the stories that he was selling her. \u2026 It sounded like he was trying to be something that he was not.",
      "Jennifer says after her sister met Doyle, Lori became distant.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: I would talk to Lori three times a day.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: And then when Shawn came into the picture?",
      "Jennifer Leonard: It was \u2014 it was a little quiet.",
      "And things only got worse.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: I had called her one night and he was over there and all I could hear in the background was him yelling at her. And that \u2014 that was like, \"what is this?\" And she's like, you know I'll call you back. It's not a big deal.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: But I think what scared me more than anything was when he was caught yelling at her \u2026 it stopped. Like the kind of guys that you know don't want anyone else to see what happens behind closed doors. \u2026 He was sneaky.",
      "Soon after this incident, Lori ended her romantic relationship with Doyle. Lori told Jennifer they agreed to be just friends and that he was fine with it.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: And I was like, no, he's not. Nope. People like that aren't just OK with being friends.",
      "Despite the breakup, Doyle would still drive three hours from Hudson Falls to visit Lori. Oftentimes hanging out at the bar where she waitressed late at night.",
      "Dorothy Tucker: Shawn, always called me and he \u2014 he'd call me to get advice.",
      "Dorothy Tucker lived down the street from Doyle in Hudson Falls and considered him a close friend.",
      "Dorothy Tucker: I saw a sweet guy who would bend over backwards if I asked him to.",
      "However, after the relationship with Lori ended, she says Doyle told her he had followed Lori and watched her as she went out on a date.",
      "Dorothy Tucker: I was like, \"Shawn, you can't do that. \u2026 She does not wanna be with you.\"",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Were you starting to get concerned about him and his behavior at that point?",
      "Dorothy Tucker: No. No. Because he agreed with me. \u2026 I didn't see the monster that he really was \u2026 He hid it quite well.",
      "On Friday, April \u00a029, 2005, Lori, who was living with Jennifer, moved to a new rental apartment.",
      "Dustin Delatore: Usually people are miserable when they're moving. She was just happy.",
      "Lori's nephew Dustin Delatore, who was 15 at the time, helped with the move.",
      "Dustin Delatore:\u00a0 She wanted her own place. \u2026 She saw her future in that day.",
      "Also helping with the move was Shawn Doyle, who offered up use of his truck.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: She had asked a couple people before that. So he was a last resort. \u2026 He was still playing the \"I'm your friend.\"",
      "Anne Marie Green: What was Shawn like that day?",
      "Dustin Delatore: Standoffish. Just, I mean, quiet.",
      "Jennifer says the move went smoothly until Doyle decided to hang around\u2014 and stayed with Lori in her new place for days.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: It was starting to get on her nerves now.",
      "Five days after the move, Jennifer says Lori told her Doyle was finally leaving because Lori had plans to go to Albany for the afternoon.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: She was supposed to go pick up the tickets.",
      "Tickets to a Yankees game \u2014 a gift from someone she had met at work.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Were you concerned at all about her going to pick up tickets from a stranger?",
      "Jennifer Leonard: Yes, yes. But that was how she was. \u2026 She was very trusting.",
      "On Wednesday, May 4, Jennifer called Lori in the afternoon, hoping to catch her while she was heading to Albany.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: And it kept going straight to voicemail.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Was that weird?",
      "Jennifer Leonard: Oh \u2026 Her phone never went straight to voicemail. It was never off.",
      "At first Jennifer thought she may have gotten lost on the drive or that her phone battery had died.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: It wasn't a thought at the time, that, that something bad happened, just that, you know, where is she?",
      "Twenty-four hours later, when Lori never called or returned home, Jennifer notified Chittenango police.",
      "Wade Irwin: Patrol started looking into her whereabouts at that time.",
      "Lead investigator Wade Irwin searched Lori's rental apartment.",
      "Wade Irwin: She had just moved into the home. \u2026 There were still lots of boxes, items being unpacked. Didn't appear that there were any signs of a break-in, or a crime that occurred at the home. \u2026 But her car was there.",
      "And he said there was something else unsettling about the scene.",

      "Wade Irwin: The last person that \u2014 that we were able to determine that saw her, was Shawn Doyle.",

Um, wasn't she supposed to get tickets the other night?\" And I'm like, \"yeah, she was, we haven't heard from her since. I'm like, you know, if she calls you let us know because the phone's off\" \u2026 and he's like, \"oh yeah, definitely let you know \u2026\" \u2026When I hung up, I was like I had chills and I'm like, he's full of it. He knows something.",
      "A KEY CLUE IN THE CASE",
      "As days went by, Chittenango investigators reached out to everyone who had contact with Lori Leonard prior her to her disappearance\u2014 including the man she was supposed to get Yankees tickets from in Albany.",
      "Wade Irwin: He was an executive for a company. \u2026 We were able to track him down. He was interviewed.",
      "Detective Wade Irwin says the executive waited for Lori in Albany and when she never showed up, he called her and even left a message.",
      "Wade Irwin: He was \u2026 calling with concern of \u2026 where she was. \"We're supposed to meet up. I got the tickets. I'm here, are you OK? I hope an accident didn't happen.\"",
      "His alibi checked out, but Lori's phone records would reveal a lot more about another person who hadn't called.",

      "Anne-Marie Green: Shawn Doyle.",
      "Wade Irwin: Shawn Doyle. Never called, never left a message.",
      "When Chittenango police went to interview Lori's former boyfriend, he told them that on the day she disappeared, he left her apartment \"about 3 p.m.\" and then drove three hours home to Hudson Falls.",
      "Wade Irwin: He just always, had said all along\u2026 that he left her and she was alive at the apartment.",
      "When they checked out his alibi, Irwin says they couldn't clear him. Yet, Doyle was cooperative and even allowed investigators to search his truck and take photos. When they searched Doyle's glove compartment, they found something curious.",
      "Wade Irwin: There was a key with a serial number on it.",
      "As investigators kept an eye out on Doyle and continued to search for Lori, Jennifer says her family struggled to explain Lori's disappearance to her two young sons.",
      "Austin Feltrinelli: After several days to several weeks you know something's up. Your mother's not home. \u2026 The question is, you know, where is she? What's \u2014 what's she doing?",
      "Jennifer Leonard: We would say things like she got lost \u2026 you know, we'll get her. We'll find her.",
      "To make matters worse, Austin and Zackary were now separated, staying with their fathers, and only seeing each other on weekends.",
      "Austin Feltrinelli: We'd lived together our whole lives. \u2026 That was obviously different, you know, waking up every day with one \u2014 your mom's not there, uh, but two \u2014 now your brother isn't.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: We were suffering and every day our family was doing something to find her. \u2026 We were looking for her. We were a well-oiled machine.",
      "Jennifer suspected Shawn Doyle had something to do with her sister's disappearance. So, weeks after Lori vanished, she headed to Hudson Falls and held a demonstration, hoping someone there would know something about Doyle that could help investigators.",
      "Jennifer Leonard: We had posters. We had signs, we had Shawn's name up on signs, if anybody will speak to us.",
      "Dorothy Tucker says when she heard Lori's family was in town, she immediately called Doyle.",

      "Wade Irwin: I made a promise \u2026 to find a resolution to this for them and give them the closure and answers that they needed. \u2026 It was disheartening because every night \u2026 I'd call them and give them an update regardless of whether there was positive or negative information.

      "Captain Tony LeClaire is with the Washington County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Capt. Tony LeClaire: He saw, uh, what he thought to be a toolbox that goes in the back of a pickup truck floating. Thought it may be useful for him. So he grabbed onto it \u2026 towed it with his boat about a mile-and-a-half (points) \u2026 And then they dragged it outta the water there.",
      "The box was locked and emitting a foul odor, So police were called, and when they broke open the lock, authorities discovered a body inside.",

      "Also in the box was a photo of Lori's two sons.",
      "Wade Irwin: She was handcuffed behind her back. \u2026 There was duct tape around the handcuffs. Her feet were bound together and duct taped. .. Her face, from chin to forehead, um, had duct tape. And then once that duct tape was removed there was a bandana tied in her mouth.",
      "The Medical Examiner would rule that Lori died of asphyxiation.",

      "During their search, police found sand tubes in his garage that matched the sand tubes inside the toolbox used to weigh it down.",
      "Wade Irwin: We were able to track down in the home, similar handcuffs, bandanas, duct tape other means that he used that matched what was used on Lori.",
      "Remember that key investigators had discovered in Doyle's truck? It matched the lock of the toolbox, tying Doyle directly to the crime.",
      "When investigators checked the bridge near the canal where the toolbox was found, they discovered scratches on the bridge railing that matched scratches found on the bottom of the toolbox.",
      "Anne Marie Green: Just tell me about what investigators think happened? What was the theory?",
      "Capt. Tony LeClaire: The theory is that he came here with his pickup truck, came to the bridge, um, somewhere in the center of the canal and took the toolbox and basically just pushed it over the edge \u2026 and as he did, it scraped across.",

      "Jennifer Leonard: I watched a little boy break. He said not a word.",
      "Then it was time to tell 9-year-old Austin.",

      "When C.C. learned that the victim was 33-year-old Lori Leonard, a single mom of two young boys, she says she was overwhelmed with extreme guilt.",
      "C.C. Opanowski: That was a breaking point for me. I felt for her whole entire family and her two young children.",
      "C.C. says she was haunted by the choice she made as a traumatized and scared teenager.",

    "story": [
      "Levittown, Pennsylvania \u2014 At a town hall Saturday in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona encouraged the Democratic party to return to its roots as the \"big tent\" party.",
      "\"What happened the last election is that we got so pure, and we kept so pure that we started kicking people out of the tent,\" Gallego said. \"It ends up there aren't enough people in the tent to win elections.\"",
      "Gallego cited podcast host Joe Rogan as an example of someone \"kicked out\" of the tent because his message did not completely align with the party's.",
      "\"I'm sure you guys heard like, 'Oh, well, the Democrats need to have their own Joe Rogan,'\" Gallego said. \"We had Joe Rogan. We canceled Joe Rogan years ago. Democrats don't want to admit this. We did, and then it was, became questionable whether we should go on Joe Rogan or not. We did this to ourselves.\"",
      "The first-term Democratic senator from Arizona touted his own success in a battleground state as an example of how Democratic candidates can win moving forward. Gallego defeated Republican Kari Lake in the Arizona Senate race last year by two points.",
      "\"I represent a state that has 330,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats,\" Gallego said. \"You have to get a lot of votes, and that means we're going to have to have alliances with people that we may not agree with 100% of the time, right?\"",
      "This success has fueled speculation that Gallego is considering running for president in 2028. He's one of a handful of Democrats making stops across the country, talking to voters, similar to Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",
      "\"Of course, I've thought of it, but I'm also, you know, about to\u2026 have my third kid coming June 12, and I don't want to get divorced, and I just became a US senator,\" Gallego told CBS News. \"I love my job, and I need to make sure I do both jobs well. That's not what I'm thinking about right now.",
      "When asked if he thinks it will take a moderate like him to win Pennsylvania in 2028, Gallego said it will take someone who is able to empathize with voters on issues impacting them.",
      "\"I think it's going to take someone that really understands what's going on. People were hurting in the last election. I think the Democrats messed up by not really focusing on that,\" Gallego said. \"This person is gonna be able to communicate that like, yeah, things are bad. The economy hurts. You're hurting, and I'm here to help you out.\"",
      "Gallego spoke in Bucks County, a key battleground area north of Philadelphia that President Trump flipped by a few hundred votes in 2024.",
      "Distrust and anger toward the Democratic party were palpable at the town hall when one participant asked Gallego how Democrats should change their messaging moving forward.",
      "\"People don't vote for a party, right? It's us that run as Democrats. We need to be the face of the party, and we need to be out there,\" Gallego said. \"The problem is that we are too effing safe all the time.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 10 May 2025 21:25:04 -0400",
    "summary": "New Orleans Saints veteran starting quarterback Derek Carr said he decided to retire because of an injury in his right shoulder.",
    "story": [
      "New Orleans Saints veteran starting quarterback Derek Carr is retiring because of a labral tear in his right shoulder and \"significant degenerative changes\" to his rotator cuff, the team announced Saturday.",
      "Carr, 34, has played for 11 pro seasons since being selected out of Fresno State by the then-Oakland Raiders in the second round of the 2014 NFL draft.",
      "He was acquired by the Saints as a free agent in 2023 but had mixed results in New Orleans, going 14-13 as a starter while struggling through oblique, hand and head injuries that caused him to miss seven games last season.",
      "Carr, who was entering the third year of a four-year, $150 million contract, experienced unexpected pain in his throwing shoulder when he began to ramp up training on his own this offseason. That led to the diagnosis which now has cut short his career.",
      "\"Surgery was an option, jeopardizing the entire 2025 season, yet there was no guarantee Derek would return to the level of strength, function and performance of play to which he was accustomed,\" the Saints said in a written announcement.",
      "The Saints did not acknowledge Carr's injury until the day before this year's NFL draft in late April. Carr did not speak publicly about the injury until a few days later, when he\u00a0delivered a guest sermon at a Las Vegas church. In that sermon, Carr said his critics were \"lying\" about him when they questioned the unusual timing of the injury, as well as both the team's and Carr's initial reticence to address it openly or answer questions about it.",
      "Carr has career passing totals of 41,245 yards, 257 touchdowns and 112 interceptions. The four-time Pro Bowler retires with a 77-92 regular-season record as a starter, 0-1 in the playoffs.",
      "Carr said he made his decision in consultation with his wife, Heather, and \"upon reflection of prayer.\"",
      "\"For more than 11 years, we have been incredibly blessed, and we are forever grateful and humbled by this experience,\" Carr said. \"It's difficult to find the right words to express our thanks to all the teammates, coaches, management, ownership, team officials and especially the fans who made this journey so special.\"",
      "\"I sleep well knowing that I gave my teammates, my coaches, and my cities my all,\" Carr added.",
      "The decision also comes after New Orleans, heading into its first season with Kellen Moore as coach, used a high\u00a0second-round draft choice to select Louisville's Tyler Shough.",
      "Now Shough, who learned of Carr's decision just before taking the field for a rookie camp practice on Saturday, will have a chance to compete for a starting job.",
      "\"All I want is an opportunity,\" said the 26-year-old Shough, who, in part because of injuries, spent seven years at the college level with three programs, starting with Oregon and Texas Tech. \"I've been at points in my career where I would just be dying to get on the field because I was injured. I was a backup before and I was a starter. So, I know a lot of those roles and what it looks like, and I think I can operate well in any of them.\"",
      "\"I'm just really excited for that opportunity to go out there and prove myself,\" he added.",
      "Other QBs on the Saints roster include second-year pro Spencer Rattler and third-year player Jake Haener, who did not post a victory between them in seven games last season, six of which Rattler started.",
      "Carr's retirement \"will provide some of those younger quarterbacks a chance to just get ready from a rep standpoint and opportunity standpoint,\" Moore said. \"Obviously, those guys will be ready and fired up for that.\"",
      "Moore was noncommittal about the possibility of bringing in an established veteran QB through free agency.",
      "\"We'll certainly have awareness of it,\" Moore said. \"We're ready if the opportunity presents itself.\"",
      "Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1966, just 12 quarterbacks who were not drafted in the first round have started season-openers as rookies. One of them was Carr. Another was the Cowboys' Dak Prescott in 2016, when Moore was a reserve QB in Dallas.",
      "Prescott \"was obviously a fourth-round pick and probably wasn't anticipating being a starter that year,\" noted Moore, who also coached Prescott as Dallas' QBs coach in 2018 and as offensive coordinator from 2019 to 2022. \"These guys all come from different paths.\"",

    "summary": "Trade discussions between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng ended after a day of prolonged negotiations and will resume Sunday, a source said.",
    "story": [
      "Sensitive talks between U.S. and Chinese delegations over tariffs that threaten to upend the global economy ended after a day of prolonged negotiations and will resume Sunday, a source briefed on the meetings confirmed to CBS News.",
      "President Trump\u00a0posted on his social media\u00a0Saturday evening after the meetings concluded, saying \"great progress\" was made.",
      "\"A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business.\"",
      "There initially was no immediate indication whether any progress was made Saturday during the more than 10-hour meeting between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland. The talks, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff, have been shrouded in secrecy and neither side made comments to reporters on the way out.",
      "Based on Bessent's\u00a0interview with Fox News\u00a0last week, initial discussions were likely about \"de-escalation, not about the big trade deal.\" The Treasury secretary said the U.S. and China have \"shared interests\" because the sky-high tariffs imposed by both countries last month are not \"sustainable.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is also in Switzerland alongside Bessent for the talks.",
      "Several convoys of black vehicles left the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, which hosted the talks aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies. Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks took place.",
      "The talks were taking place in the sumptuous 18th-century \"Villa Saladin\" overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government.",
      "The hope is that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they've slapped on each other's goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "In an interview with\u00a0NBC News\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump claimed Chinese officials \"want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal.\" The president also said he expected to lower tariffs on China \"at some point.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese officials have said they are open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade, but\u00a0pushed the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0to drop its \"unilateral\" tariffs first.",
      "Mr. Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China\u00a0to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries' boycotting each other's products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Even before the talks began, Mr. Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \"80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\"The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\" she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \"It cannot just be words.\"",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has aggressively used tariffs as\u00a0his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example,\u00a0imposed a 10% tax on imports\u00a0from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that claimed China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These The allegations include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2014 such as China's subsidies \u2014 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn't come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China's tech policy now resumes.",
      "Mr. Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland on Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Mr. Trump last month\u00a0suspended plans\u00a0to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but warned he could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\"An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland's interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\" the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \"is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\"",
      "On Saturday, Bessent said trade talks with Switzerland were \"very productive,\" and he was \"optimistic about the speed of these negotiations,\" citing Mr. Trump's trade deal with the U.K. that's still being finalized.",
      "\"I am glad that we have agreed on accelerated trade talks, and we expect that a detailed Swiss proposal will be submitted to Ambassador Greer by next week,\" Bessent wrote on social media. \"Swiss companies have indicated their interest in investing CHF 150-200 billion in new U.S. investments thanks to President Trump's policies, and we look forward to our continued talks.\"",
      "The U.S. is Switzerland's second-biggest trading partner after the European Union \u2013 the 27-member country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",
      "The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.",

    "story": [
      "America's most European city is buzzing over the news that the Catholic Church's new pope is not only from the U.S. but also has Haitian and Creole ancestors from New Orleans.",
      "While Pope Leo XIV was born in Chicago, Illinois, records show that his family lineage has deep roots in Louisiana. When his maternal great-grandmother was just a baby, she was baptized in 1840 at the city's iconic St. Louis Cathedral in Jackson Square, the New Orleans Archdiocese said.",
      "A couple of decades later, the pope's maternal great-grandparents \u2014 Ferdinand D. Baquie and Eugenie Grambois \u2014 married on Sept. 19, 1864, in New Orleans' St. Mary's Church on Chartres Street, according to the New Orleans Archdiocese's sacramental records.",
      "According to records from the Vital Records Collection at the Louisiana State Archives, Leo's great-grandparents' death certificates show they died in Louisiana, as well.",
      "A marriage certificate from the Louisiana State Archives shows Leo's maternal grandparents \u2014 Joseph N. Martinez and Louise Baquie \u2014 married in New Orleans on Sept. 17, 1887.",
      "Historians say the pope's grandparents moved to Chicago in the early 1900s and they remained married for over 50 years.",
      "Jari Honora, family Historian with the Historic New Orleans Collection, was the first to discover the pontiff's family ties.",
      "\"I was just thrilled and almost in disbelief that the pope would have a New Orleans connection,\" Honora said.",
      "Louisiana State Archives records also show the pope's maternal grandmother identified as being from New Orleans and his grandfather identified as being a native of Haiti.",
      "He says the pontiff's maternal grandfather, Joseph Martinez, was later listed as being from the Dominican Republic. However, in the earliest census records in which he appears, Martinez and his entire household were listed as being from Louisiana.",
      "\"It causes you to wonder, maybe there was sort of a conscious memory of some Haitian ancestry that he was speaking to, or maybe he really thought that he had been born in Haiti, or maybe there was even early on, an attempt to sort of obfuscate the true origins of the family,\" Honora said. \"I can tell you that by the time they get to Chicago, there's one census where he's listed as Maltese, which is not correct.\"",
      "Honora \u2014 a Creole Catholic himself \u2014 said the choice of such a multi-cultural pontiff is a special moment for the city of New Orleans and for Creole culture.",
      "\"It highlights the role that Catholics of color, that Black Catholics have always played, in the church since the very beginning,\" Honora said. \"We sort of take for granted here on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana in particular, that there are Catholics of color, there are Black Catholics in the church.\"",
      "Honora said he's still researching whether the new highest leader of the Catholic Church has ancestors who were once enslaved.",
      "\"I'm quite confident that we will get there on at least one line, and I say only one line... documenting enslaved ancestors is a totally different experience than some of the more contemporary research, say, 20th century or late 19th century research, where you have widespread adherence to vital records laws,\" Honora said. \"Prior to the 1870 census, after the Civil War, enslaved people are not listed in the census by name at all \u2014 there are only tick marks, check marks on slave schedules.\"",
      "Honora noted that Pope Leo's love of cooking, and that of his mother, is likely something passed down from their Creole roots.",
      "\"That was one of the things that I read in interviews that the Holy Father did long before he was even a candidate for the papacy is that he was open to a vocation, because the neighborhood priests from the surrounding parishes, they were always in his home, because they loved his mother's cooking, and now we know why: because she was a New Orleans cook,\" Honora said.",
      "People in the Big Easy said it's exciting to see a pope with Louisiana Creole roots.",
      "\"I think if there was going to be a first American pope, this is a very good person to take on that role, it feels like a good representation, but also, he seems like someone that it seems like is going to represent the interests of a lot of Americans, more so than other cardinals might have,\" said Emmaline Kelly, a native of New Orleans who attended Catholic school in the city and now works at a local business in the French Quarter.",
      "She says she hopes Pope Leo will schedule a visit back to see his Creole roots very soon, and in the meantime, \"hopefully follow in Francis's footsteps, and open the Catholic Church's arms to LGBT people... providing vocal support for refugees.\"",

      "However, this marked the second time in the past 180 days in which Alvarado had violated the rule while racing in Kentucky, which led to stewards doubling the fine under an \"escalating penalty structure,\" Minger explained, resulting in the $62,000 number, along with the two-day suspension that will be served at the end of May.",

      "The USGS initially reported the earthquake as a 3.5 magnitude quake before increasing it to 4.1.",

      "The USGS told the Associated Press that it received more than 23,000 reports from the public in the first hour after the earthquake.",
      "Jason Pack was still in bed at his home outside Knoxville when he felt the walls shaking and heard a rumbling that was loud enough to wake up his family and for the dog to start barking.",
      "\"In east Tennessee, you're used to tornadoes and floods, that kind of thing,\" Pack said. \"It's unusual to have an earthquake.\"",
      "Pack has experienced tremors before, although this one is probably the strongest he's felt in Tennessee.",

    "story": [
      "A judge temporarily barred the Trump administration from carrying out sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies late Friday, part of a massive federal cost-cutting drive led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of federal employee unions \u2014 are likely to show that the Trump administration's attempts to reorganize and downsize the federal government exceed its legal authority. Illston wrote that President Trump \"likely must request Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks.\"",
      "Illston's temporarily restraining order blocks a litany of federal agencies from taking any further steps to carry out a February executive order telling agencies to draw up plans for large-scale job cuts. The affected agencies \u2014 covering a wide swath of the government \u2014 can't continue laying off staff or put workers on administrative leave in order to comply with Mr. Trump's order. The order also blocks \"any further orders by DOGE to agencies to cut programs or staff\" in accordance with the executive order.",

      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to dramatically reorganize the government and downsize the federal workforce \u2014 a gambit it argues is designed to cut bureaucratic bloat and save taxpayer money. But federal unions and Democratic lawmakers view the moves as unlawful and disruptive to public services. The effort is led by Musk, whose team at DOGE has become embedded in virtually every major federal agency.",
      "The administration has already laid off or offered buyouts to thousands of staff, often focusing on probationary workers who are relatively new to federal service. Plans for deeper cuts are in the works at some agencies.",
      "In February, the Office of Personnel Management \u2014 essentially the federal government's human resources arm \u2014 ordered government agencies to make plans for a \"significant reduction\" in the number of staff.",
      "The lawsuit that led to Friday's restraining order alleges these moves are an \"unconstitutional dismantling of the federal government by the President of the United States on a scale unprecedented in this country's history and in clear excess of his authority.\"",
      "The suit argues Mr. Trump doesn't have the power to reorganize and slash federal agencies without authorization from Congress.",
      "The lawsuit also argues DOGE, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management don't have the legal authority to order sweeping government-wide cuts.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed back, writing in legal filings that \"Congress has expressly authorized federal agencies to engage in [reductions-in-force] and has done so for nearly 150 years.\" It notes the Trump administration's executive orders and memos specifically said agencies' cost-cutting plans should follow the law, and argues the administration provided \"broad guidance\" rather than dictating specific layoffs.",
      "Illston largely sided with the plaintiffs Friday, writing they are likely to show Mr. Trump, DOGE, OMB and OPM exceeded their authority. The judge also said the plaintiffs presented evidence that agencies have made cuts \"at the direction of the President and his team,\" rather than treating the administration's memos as general guidance.",
      "The Trump administration's cost-cutting drive has run into several other lawsuits. In March, a federal judge ordered the administration to rehire thousands of probationary workers. The Supreme Court later paused that ruling\u00a0while the litigation plays out.",

      "The Trump administration is \"actively looking at\" the possibility of suspending the writ of habeas corpus to handle people the administration says aren't in the country legally, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Friday.",
      "A writ of habeas corpus requires authorities to produce in court an individual they are holding and justify their confinement. Article I of the Constitution says the \"privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\"",
      "Miller made the comments to reporters at the White House Friday when a journalist asked if President Trump is weighing the possibility of suspending habeas corpus to handle illegal immigration.",
      "\"Well, the Constitution is clear \u2014 and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land \u2014 that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion,\" Miller said. \"So it's an option we're actively looking at. Look, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.\"",
      "The Trump administration is fighting multiple lawsuits over its handling of undocumented immigrants, including migrants it flew to El Salvador for imprisonment. Mr. Trump has flouted the idea that all people suspected of being in the country illegally should receive hearings or trials, and has criticized federal courts and judges for getting in the way of the deportation process.",
      "\"We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years,\" the president said in a social media post in April.",
      "Lawyers for the Trump administration have previously cast illegal immigration as an invasion: The government deported undocumented immigrants to El Salvador using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law that allows for deportations when the United States is subject to an invasion by a foreign government.\u00a0 Some judges have pushed back on the argument.",
      "The writ of habeas corpus has been suspended only a handful of times in the U.S. and its territories since the Constitution was ratified. It was suspended across the states during the entire Civil War; in counties in South Carolina that were overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction; in specific places in the Philippines during an insurrection in 1905; and in Hawaii following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It has never been suspended in the U.S. to handle illegal immigration.",
      "Although habeas corpus is in the Constitution, it's a legal doctrine that dates back well beyond the country's founding. The term \"habeas corpus\" is Latin for \"you shall have the body,\" hence the requirement that the incarcerated person be physically brought before a judge in court.",

      "\"We reiterate our backing for President Trump's calls for a peace deal and call on Russia to stop obstructing efforts to secure an enduring peace,\" the leaders said in a joint statement. \"Alongside the U.S., we call on Russia to agree to a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to create the space for talks on a just and lasting peace.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to a conflict-ending agreement, but while Zelenskyy agreed to an American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, Russia has not signed on. Instead, it has kept up attacks along the roughly 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer) front line, including deadly strikes on residential areas with no obvious military targets.",
      "On Saturday morning, local officials in Ukraine's northern Sumy region said Russian shelling over the past day killed three residents and wounded four more.

    "published": "Sat, 10 May 2025 19:42:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Trade discussions between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng ended after a day of prolonged negotiations and will resume Sunday, a source said.",
    "story": [
      "Sensitive talks between U.S. and Chinese delegations over tariffs that threaten to upend the global economy ended after a day of prolonged negotiations and will resume Sunday, a source briefed on the meetings confirmed to CBS News.",
      "President Trump\u00a0posted on his social media\u00a0Saturday evening after the meetings concluded, saying \"great progress\" was made.",
      "\"A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business.\"",
      "There initially was no immediate indication whether any progress was made Saturday during the more than 10-hour meeting between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland. The talks, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff, have been shrouded in secrecy and neither side made comments to reporters on the way out.",
      "Based on Bessent's\u00a0interview with Fox News\u00a0last week, initial discussions were likely about \"de-escalation, not about the big trade deal.\" The Treasury secretary said the U.S. and China have \"shared interests\" because the sky-high tariffs imposed by both countries last month are not \"sustainable.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is also in Switzerland alongside Bessent for the talks.",
      "Several convoys of black vehicles left the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, which hosted the talks aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies. Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks took place.",
      "The talks were taking place in the sumptuous 18th-century \"Villa Saladin\" overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government.",
      "The hope is that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they've slapped on each other's goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "In an interview with\u00a0NBC News\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump claimed Chinese officials \"want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal.\" The president also said he expected to lower tariffs on China \"at some point.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese officials have said they are open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade, but\u00a0pushed the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0to drop its \"unilateral\" tariffs first.",
      "Mr. Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China\u00a0to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries' boycotting each other's products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Even before the talks began, Mr. Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \"80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\"The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\" she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \"It cannot just be words.\"",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has aggressively used tariffs as\u00a0his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example,\u00a0imposed a 10% tax on imports\u00a0from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that claimed China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These The allegations include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2014 such as China's subsidies \u2014 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn't come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China's tech policy now resumes.",
      "Mr. Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland on Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Mr. Trump last month\u00a0suspended plans\u00a0to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but warned he could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\"An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland's interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\" the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \"is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\"",
      "On Saturday, Bessent said trade talks with Switzerland were \"very productive,\" and he was \"optimistic about the speed of these negotiations,\" citing Mr. Trump's trade deal with the U.K. that's still being finalized.",
      "\"I am glad that we have agreed on accelerated trade talks, and we expect that a detailed Swiss proposal will be submitted to Ambassador Greer by next week,\" Bessent wrote on social media. \"Swiss companies have indicated their interest in investing CHF 150-200 billion in new U.S. investments thanks to President Trump's policies, and we look forward to our continued talks.\"",
      "The U.S. is Switzerland's second-biggest trading partner after the European Union \u2013 the 27-member country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",
      "The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.",

    "published": "Sat, 10 May 2025 11:14:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Pope Leo XIV identified artificial intelligence as one of the most critical matters facing humanity during his first formal audience.",
    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV made a surprise visit Saturday to a sanctuary south of Rome that is dedicated to the Madonna and of significance to his Augustinian order.",
      "Townspeople of Genazzano gathered in the square outside the main church housing the Madre del Buon Consiglio sanctuary, waiting for Leo to emerge, according to images broadcast by Italy's Catholic TV2000. The pontiff was expected to bless the crowd after finishing his prayers.",
      "Leo previously visited the sanctuary, which is managed by Augustinian friars, last year, when he was a cardinal. It has been a place of pilgrimage since the 15th century.",
      "The pontiff earlier laid out the vision of his papacy Saturday, identifying\u00a0artificial intelligence\u00a0as one of the most critical matters facing humanity and vowing to continue in some of the core priorities of\u00a0Pope Francis.",
      "In his first formal audience, Leo repeatedly cited Francis and the Argentine pope's own 2013 mission statement, making clear a commitment to making the Catholic Church more inclusive, attentive to the faithful and a church that looks out for the \"least and rejected.\"",
      "Leo, the first American pope, told the cardinals who elected him that he was fully committed to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, the 1960s meetings that modernized the church. He identified AI as one of the main issues facing humanity, saying it poses challenges to defending human dignity, justice and labor.",
      "In another hint to his priorities, the Vatican revealed that Leo, a member of the Augustinian religious order, would retain the motto and coat of arms that he had as bishop of Chiclayo, Peru. The motto, \"In Illo uno unum,\" was pronounced by St. Augustine in a sermon to explain that \"although we Christians are many, in the one Christ we are one.\"",
      "Leo referred to AI in explaining the choice of his name: His namesake, Pope Leo XIII, was pope from 1878 to 1903 and laid the foundation for modern Catholic social thought. He did so most famously with his 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum, which addressed workers' rights and capitalism at the dawn of the industrial age. The late pope criticized both laissez-faire capitalism and state-centric socialism, giving shape to a distinctly Catholic vein of economic teaching.",
      "In his remarks Saturday, Leo said he identified with his predecessor, who addressed the great social question of the day posed by the industrial revolution in the encyclical.",
      "\"In our own day, the church offers everyone the treasury of its social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour,\" he said.",
      "Toward the end of his pontificate, Francis became increasingly vocal about the threats to humanity posed by AI and called for an international treaty to regulate it.",
      "He warned that such powerful technology risks turning human relations into mere algorithms. Francis brought his message to the Group of Seven industrialized nations when he addressed their summit last year, insisting AI must remain human-centric so that decisions about when to use weapons or even less-lethal tools always remain made by humans and not machines.",
      "The late Argentine pope also used his 2024 annual peace message to call for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, arguing that a technology lacking human values of compassion, mercy, morality and forgiveness is too perilous to develop unchecked.",
      "Francis in many ways saw the Chicago-born Augustinian missionary Robert Prevost as something of an heir apparent: He moved him to take over a small Peruvian diocese in 2014, where Prevost later became bishop and head of the Peruvian bishops conference, and then called him to Rome to take over one of the most important Vatican offices vetting bishop nominations in 2023.",
      "In the speech, delivered in Italian in the Vatican's synod hall \u2013 not the Apostolic Palace \u2013 Leo made repeated references to Francis and the mourning over his death. He held up Francis' mission statement at the 2013 start of his pontificate, \"The Joy of the Gospel,\" as something of his own marching orders, suggesting he intends very much to continue in Francis' priorities.",
      "He cited Francis' insistence on the missionary nature of the church and the need to make its leadership more collegial. He cited the need to pay attention to what the faithful say \"especially in its most authentic and inclusive forms, especially popular piety.\" Again, referring to Francis' 2013 mission statement, Leo cited the need for the church to express \"loving care for the least and rejected\" and engage in courageous dialogue with the contemporary world.",
      "Greeted by a standing ovation as he entered, Leo read from his prepared text, only looking up occasionally. Even when he first appeared to the world on the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday night, Leo read from a prepared, handwritten text that he must have drafted sometime before his historic election or the hour or so after. He seemed most comfortable, speaking off-the-cuff in the few words he pronounced in Spanish.",
      "Louis Prevost told CBS News that his younger brother always had a calling towards religion.",
      "\"Rob used to like to play priest,\" Louis Prevost said. \"We'd say 'Let's go play cops and robbers,' and he'd be like, 'I want to play priest first.\"",
      "Prevost was elected the 267th pontiff on Thursday on the fourth ballot of the conclave, an exceptionally fast outcome given this was the largest and most geographically diverse conclave in history and not all cardinals knew one another before arriving in Rome.",
      "Cardinals have said Prevost did not make any major speech during the pre-conclave discussions, and he carried into the conclave the traditional taboo precluding a pope from the United States given America's superpower status. But Prevost was already known to many of them given his decades as a missionary and then bishop in Peru, and had been the head of the Vatican's bishops office since 2023.",

    "summary": "The 2025 papal conclave at the Vatican ended with the election of American-born Cardinal Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV. Here's what to know about him.",
    "story": [
      "After fewer than 24 hours of seclusion in the Vatican, cardinals ended the 2025 papal conclave with the election of a new pontiff. The man chosen,\u00a0Cardinal Robert Prevost, will be known as Pope Leo XIV \u2014 the first pope ever from the United States.",
      "Here's what to know about him.",
      "Where is Pope Leo XIV from?",
      "Pope Leo XIV was born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago\u00a0in 1955. He is the first U.S. pope in the church's history, and is also a citizen of Peru, where he worked for many years.",
      "CBS News Chicago reports he grew up in south suburban Dolton and has two brothers. A woman who knew him in childhood says the Prevost family was very active in their church.",
      "\"His family was very, very devout Catholics. I will say that. The mom and dad both were,\" Linda Jorsch told the station. \"They never missed church, and they were very active within our parish. His mom was like a member of the Altar & Rosary Society. They were lectors in their church \u2014 very active, very devout family.\"",
      "But the pontiff also has deep roots in Louisiana, and has Haitian and Creole ancestry.",
      "When his maternal great-grandmother was just a baby, she was baptized in 1840 at the city's iconic St. Louis Cathedral in Jackson Square, the New Orleans Archdiocese said.",
      "A couple of decades later, the pope's maternal great-grandparents \u2014 Ferdinand D. Baquie and Eugenie Grambois \u2014 married on Sept. 19, 1864, in New Orleans' St. Mary's Church on Chartres Street, according to the New Orleans Archdiocese's sacramental records.",
      "According to records from the Vital Records Collection at the Louisiana State Archives, Leo's great-grandparents' death certificates show they died in Louisiana, as well.",
      "A marriage certificate from the Louisiana State Archives shows Leo's maternal grandparents \u2014 Joseph N. Martinez and Louise Baquie \u2014 married in New Orleans on Sept. 17, 1887.",
      "Historians say the pope's grandparents moved to Chicago in the early 1900s, and they remained married for over 50 years. Louisiana State Archives records also show the pope's maternal grandmother identified as being from New Orleans and his grandfather identified as being a native of Haiti.",
      "Pope Leo graduated from\u00a0Villanova University in Pennsylvania with a degree in mathematics, then studied theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago, where he earned a Master's of Divinity.",
      "When he was 27, he was sent to Rome to study, and he was ordained as a priest in 1982. He went on to earn a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.",
      "\"My experience of Cardinal Prevost was that he's not a showboat.\" a seminary classmate, Father Mark R. Francis, CSV, provincial of the Viatorians in the United States, told CBS News Chicago. \"He's very calm, but extremely intelligent, and extremely compassionate.\"",
      "Pope Leo XIV has voted in U.S. elections \u2014 and weighed in on Trump administration",
      "The new pope is registered to vote in the Chicago suburbs, and voting records obtained by CBS News show he's voted in several general elections \u2014 along with both Democratic and Republican primaries.",
      "He voted in the 2024 general election, as well as in the 2012, 2008, 2004 and 2000 cycles, according to the records. He also cast ballots in the 2016 and 2012 Republican presidential primaries, and in the 2008 and 2010 Democratic primaries.",
      "The now-pope has shared posts about politics on his X account for years, in some cases reposting criticisms of the Trump administration's stances on immigration.",
      "At one point, he shared an article headlined, \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.\" The article criticized the Catholic vice president for claiming Christians can prioritize love for family, then neighbors, their community, fellow citizens and, lastly, the world.",
      "What is Pope Leo XIV's background in the church?",
      "After his ordination, Prevost went to work as a missionary in Peru. He returned to the U.S. for a few years and then went back to Peru, where he ran an Augustinian seminary in Trujillo.",
      "In 2014, he was appointed apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo in Peru by Pope Francis, according to the Vatican. A year later, he became a bishop.",
      "Pope Francis made him a cardinal in 2023.",
      "Before becoming pope, Prevost, who is 69, was the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversaw the selection of new bishops.",
      "Overall, he's considered a centrist, but on many social issues, he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.",
      "\"He kept a low profile on the most contentious, nerualgic, sensitive, controversial issues\" facing the church, said CBS News papal contributor Francis X. Rocca.",
      "Pope Leo XIV congratulated by presidents, Chicago mayor",
      "President Trump posted a message on social media congratulating the first U.S.-born pope.",
      "\"Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very  meaningful moment!\" he wrote.",
      "Former President Joe Biden, who is Catholic, tweeted: \"Habemus papam - May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois. Jill and I congratulate him and wish him success.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama also shared his best wishes for \"a fellow Chicagoan.\" \"Michelle and I send our congratulations to a fellow Chicagoan, His Holiness Pope Leo XIV. This is a historic day for the United States, and we will pray for him as he begins the sacred work of leading the Catholic Church and setting an example for so many, regardless of faith,\" Obama wrote.",
      "In\u00a0Prevost's hometown, many people celebrated his election, with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson tweeting: \"Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago!\"",
      "\"Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon,\" Johnson wrote.",
      "Why did Pope Leo XIV choose his name?",
      "The first act of a new pope after he's elected is to choose a new name. This is to signify that his becoming pontiff is akin to a second birth, the Vatican said.",
      "Cardinal Prevost\u00a0chose the papal name Leo, one of the more popular choices in history, which has been used by 13 previous popes. The most recent one, Pope Leo XIII, served from 1878 to 1903.",
      "\"The name Leo harkens back to Pope Leo the Great,\" CBS News papal contributor Candida Moss explained. Also known as Pope Leo I, his papacy was from 440 to 461 and included a famous meeting with Attila the Hun where Leo dissuaded him from attacking Rome.",
      "\"What does this mean for our new pope? Well, it might mean that he too is going to stand up to oppressive political forces in the world,\" Moss said.",
      "She noted that Leo I was also known as \"a great intellectual and theological reformer.\"",
      "Bishop Robert Barron, of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, also saw it as an homage to Leo XIII and called it \"very significant.\"",
      "Leo XIII was a \"great 19th century pope,\" Barron told CBS News. \"When the revolutions in the 18th century happened, and the philosophical revolutions of the 19th century, the church initially said 'no' to much of that. Leo represents a very nuanced, intelligent engagement with modernity \u2014 not caving into it, not saying yes completely, but not saying no \u2014 using the resources of our own traditions to engage modernity creatively. That makes him a bridge figure.\"",
      "The name a new pope chooses often reflects attributes they hope to embody in their papacy.",
      "It will \"indicate a certain spirit and direction and vision of the new pope,\" said Dennis Doyle, a theologian and professor emeritus of religious studies at the University of Dayton.",
      "Pope Francis, for example, was the first pope in history to take that name, a nod to St. Francis of Assisi. In Catholic tradition, St. Francis of Assisi had a mystical vision of Jesus, who told him to rebuild his church. He also renounced his wealth and founded the Franciscan order of friars in 1290.",

    "summary": "Neighbors India and Pakistan have a long history of military clashes, but this is why the nuclear-armed neighbors were fighting before announcing a ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi\u00a0\u2014 A\u00a0deadly terrorist attack\u00a0in Indian-administered Kashmir's picturesque Pahalgam area in April brought India and Pakistan once again to the brink of war. The nuclear-armed South Asian neighbors attacked each other this week with missiles and drones in a sudden flare-up of a decades-old feud that's being watched with concern by leaders around the world.",
      "On Saturday, the countries announced they had agreed to a ceasefire after U.S.-led mediation talks. President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire on\u00a0Truth Social, saying both nations had used \"Common Sense and Great Intelligence\" to reach a \"full and immediate ceasefire.\"",
      "The announcement came after the countries traded drone strikes against each other's military facilities overnight.",
      "Pakistani officials have accused India of killing at least 36 people this week, including 26 it says died in a Tuesday night missile attack on multiple locations, which Islamabad labeled an \"act of war.\" India called those strikes a measured response to the April terrorist attack, claiming it had killed 100 terrorists at camps and other sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.",
      "The rivalry between the two countries goes back decades, and at the heart of the dispute lies the stunning mountainous region of Kashmir.",
      "The Kashmir conflict explained",
      "Kashmir is a Himalayan region dotted with snow-capped mountains, pristine lakes, and beautiful meadows. It was previously one of the many \"princely states\" of India, ruled by so-called maharajas, before India gained independence from British rule in August 1947 .",
      "That independence, however, has never been a simple matter. As it ceded its colonial power, Britain partitioned India into two nations: Hindu-majority India, and Muslim-majority Pakistan.",
      "The migration of Hindus from the newly carved out Pakistan into India, and of Muslims from India into Pakistan, was marred by massacres and widespread sectarian violence. It is widely considered the deadliest partitioning of a nation in contemporary history.",
      "At the time of partition, Kashmir was a Muslim-majority princely state, and its Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh, chose to remain independent of the two newly defined nations. But in October 1947, when tribesmen from Pakistan invaded Kashmir, the Maharaja sought India's help.",
      "India agreed to come to his assistance, but only if Singh would let India claim dominion over Kashmir as a precondition. The Maharaja agreed.",
      "India sent its army to Kashmir, which drove out the Pakistani tribesmen and, for all intents and purposes, Kashmir became a semi-autonomous part of India.",
      "India and Pakistan's wars over Kashmir",
      "Pakistan refused to recognize Kashmir's accession to India, dismissing it as a fraud. The standoff led the two nations into their first war that same year, and it endured into 1948.",
      "India asked the United Nations to intervene. The U.N. recommended that, after the full demilitarization of the region by both armies, a vote be held by Kashmir's residents to determine its future.",
      "That was never achieved, and in 1949, India and Pakistan signed a ceasefire agreement that divided hotly-contested Kashmir into two parts.",
      "Both nations claim all of Kashmir as their own territory, but each controls only part of it. Another, northeastern portion of the region is administered by China, which has long been a point of friction between Delhi and Beijing.",
      "In 1965, the tension over the region between India and Pakistan again erupted into a full-scale war. Thousands of people were killed on both sides. About seven years later, an agreement was signed that formally established a Line of Control (LoC) dividing Kashmir, which still serves as the de-facto border between the two rivals.",
      "In 1989, a heavily armed pro-independence insurgency took root in Indian-administered Kashmir, launching deadly attacks against Indian forces. India has long accused Pakistan of training, arming and backing those militants \u2014 a charge Pakistan flatly denies.",
      "The three-decade insurgency has left tens of thousands of people dead.",
      "Pakistan has consistently denied the allegations that it supports Kashmiri separatists.",
      "In 1999, the two countries again engaged in a brief war, fought along the LoC in northern Kashmir.",
      "They almost went to war again following the deadly terror attack on India's commercial capital Mumbai in 2008, which was carried out by a militant group based in Pakistan-administered Kashmir \u2014 with, Indian authorities alleged, the full support of Pakistani security forces.",
      "India removed Kashmir's autonomy in 2019",
      "As the insurgency continued, India maintained a heavy military presence in Kashmir, making it one of the most militarized zones in the world. Indian forces have killed hundreds of separatists every year in regular shootouts across and around the LoC, but they have not managed to stop the militants' attacks.",
      "In 2016, gunmen whom India said were based in Pakistan killed 19 Indian soldiers in an attack on the town of Uri. India responded by launching what it called\u00a0\"surgical strikes\"\u00a0across the LoC, targeting alleged militant bases. Pakistan denied any Indian strikes on its territory.",
      "In 2019,\u00a0another attack\u00a0blamed on alleged Pakistani gunmen, on an Indian military convoy in Kashmir's Pulwama area, killed more than 40 paramilitary forces.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, furious over the attack, ordered\u00a0airstrikes\u00a0against Pakistan, sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight in which one Indian fighter jet was downed.",
      "Later that year, India's federal government, under Modi,\u00a0revoked Kashmir's special status, lifting the partial autonomy it had enjoyed since 1947, which granted the region its own constitution and major decision-making powers.",
      "Modi's government faced criticism for the way it revoked Kashmir's autonomy. A day before his government tabled and passed the bill in parliament, Indian forces launched a major crackdown in Kashmir. Internet, television and phone lines were shut down, and civilians were ordered to remain indoors. Dozens of people, including local politicians, were placed under house arrest as India flew more paramilitary forces into the region to maintain a security and information lockdown. Some of those restrictions remained in place for more than two years.",
      "Pakistan objected to the move and vowed to \"exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps.\"",
      "Over the following years, as India continued to bolster its security presence in the region, militancy waned and tourism returned to Kashmir. Modi's government took credit for transforming the region from a hotspot for terrorism, into a hotspot for tourism.",
      "But last month's terrorist attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam changed everything. It has once again put the two nations on a war footing - and the world on edge over the risk of another major conflict breaking out in already-tumultuous times, and between two nations with a long history of animosity, and nuclear weapons.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-uk-deal-economy-10-percent-tariff-rate-risk-inflation/",
    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 17:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says a new U.S. trade pact with the U.K. can serve as the basis for more trade deals. Economists say that could be a problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday hailed his new trade pact with the U.K. as a \"maxed out deal\" that will serve as a template for agreements with other nations. But some experts are taking a dimmer view, noting that the U.K. agreement suggests high tariffs are set to remain in place for the long term.",
      "Although the deal with Britain offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports. Mr. Trump unveiled that baseline levy, which serves more broadly as a minimum import tax on other nations, as part of his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Friday that the president is \"committed to the 10% baseline tariff, not just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well.\"",
      "While a 10% tariff rate is lower than some import duties Mr. Trump imposed on other nations last month, ranging from a high of 145% for China to 11% for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it's still far higher than the effective tariff rate of 3% prior to the second Trump administration, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a nonpartisan policy think tank.",
      "Paring Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs to 10% could offer some relief for U.S. businesses and consumers facing higher costs. But it still represents a major headwind for importers, which pay the duties on goods and then pass on all or most of the cost to consumers, economists say.",
      "\"Even with a slow rollout of trade deals over the coming months, you're still going to have an effective average tariff rate that is going to be in the double-digit range,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What that means for businesses is that they're simply going to be paying more for the same goods that they have been importing, and they're going to be raising prices onto customers that have much less ability to withstand ongoing price increases.\"",
      "That, in turn, could cause Americans to tighten their wallets, a serious risk given that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 cents of every $1 in economic activity. Businesses that are stressed by tariffs could slow hiring, leading to a pullback in household income growth, Daco said.",
      "\"Modest improvement\"",
      "The deal with Britain is \"a modest improvement over what we had yesterday, but \u2014 with most U.S. tariffs still in place and very limited new U.K. liberalization \u2014 remains worse than the pre-Trump status quo,\" Scott Lincicome, Cato Institute vice president of economics, said in an email.",
      "The economic stakes for U.S. trade talks are high, with economists raising the chances of a recession due to fallout from Mr. Trump's trade war. The stock market tumbled and U.S. Treasury prices slid in the days immediately following the president's April 2 tariff announcement, underlining investor concerns that a trade war could torpedo economic growth.",
      "Stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the new\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0with the U.K.",
      "While Wall Street has largely rebounded since then on growing investor optimism that the Trump administration will soon strike new trade deals, many Americans are souring on Mr. Trump's policies. In a recent CBS News poll, 53% of those surveyed said they believe the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only 41% approved of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Even as the U.S. tries to negotiate additional trade agreements, businesses continue to face significant risks, economists note. These stem from the ongoing uncertainty over the ultimate level and duration of tariffs, making it hard for companies who depend on trade to make plans on spending, hiring and their supply chains.",
      "\"Even if this tariff is lower, this fundamental anxiety related to uncertainty and unpredictability\" remains,\" said Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"If this is not resolved or addressed, then I think it'll be difficult for consumers, investors and business to fully recover.\"",
      "Even so, some experts note that the Trump administration's efforts to strike new trade deals could provide some relief to investors and businesses, as long as there's growing clarity about where the tariff policies could settle.",
      "\"Now, at least the wheels are in motion relative to discussions with a variety of countries, with the deal between the United States and U.K. as perhaps indicative of the fact that there could be tariff and trade-related de-escalation \u2014 even without a fully drawn out trade agreement,\" noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration is \"focused on the big countries,\" although he added that negotiations could drag out.",
      "\"The president doesn't want to go fast,\" Lutnick said. \"He wants to do the kind of deal we did today, where we said, 'Look, this is just a win for America,' and we figured out how to make it a win for them.\"",
      "Key meeting with China",
      "The U.K. is a fairly modest trading partner for the U.S., representing about $65 billion in annual imports, or less than one-tenth of annual imports from China.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland, and Mr. Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on the nation's goods from its current 145% level.",
      "\"80% Tariff on China seems right!\" the president wrote\u00a0Friday morning.",
      "But that might not be enough to cushion the U.S. from the headwinds of higher tariffs, according to experts.",
      "\"Even if we were to see a continuation of the universal 10% tariff applied and some rollback of higher levels, or in the case of China, 145%, we're still talking about a tariff rate that is the highest since World War II,\" Luschini said. \"And so it's going to have an impact at some form.\"",

The cardinal electors gathered for the papal conclave elected an American from among their own ranks on Thursday to serve as the new pontiff. Chicago-born\u00a0Cardinal Robert Prevost\u00a0was elected and accepted his fate as the next Bishop of Rome, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. He chose Leo XIV as his papal name.",

And his point was, if America is kind of running the world politically, culturally, economically, they don't want America running the world religiously. So, I think there's some truth to that, that we're such a superpower and so dominant, they don't wanna give us, also, control over the church.\"",

      "American Bishop Robert Barron details his view on Cardinal Robert Prevost's papal name selection, noting it strikes a balance between opposing views impacting the Church. (Credit: Bishop Robert Barron)",
      "American author, speaker and theologian Bishop Robert Barron was at the Vatican this week to witness the election of a new pope, and he shared his thoughts with Fox News Digital about Cardinal Robert Prevost's \"intriguing\" new papal name.",
      "Papal names are often very symbolic with regard to how a Pope will serve as the leader of the Catholic Church. Typically, Pope's select the names of predecessors they admire or want to emulate. Prevost ultimately went with Leo XIV in honor of Pope Leo XIII, who served from 1878 to 1903.",
      "\"He could have been Francis II, and we would have said, \u2018Oh, there he is clearly in the line of Francis.\u2019 He could have been John Paul III, then we would have thought, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s very much in that more conservative line.' He could have been John XXIV, and we say \u2018Oh, now he\u2019s a real revolutionary liberal, et cetera,'\" Barron said. \"The fact that he went back, well over 100 years, to this very interesting and pivotal figure \u2026 our new pope was saying, I too, want a critical engagement with the modern world, not simply a \u2018no,\u2019 but also not simply a \u2018yes,\u2019 not simply an acquiescence to it.\"",

      "From left to right: Pope John XXIII, Pope John Paul II, Pope Francis I, Pope Leo XIV (Getty Images/Fox News)",
      "Barron pointed out that Leo XIII was a pivotal figure due to the timing of his reign, which came during a moment when the Church was contending with the tremendous political and philosophical upheavals of the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the French and American Revolutions, and the introduction of philosophies such as Marxism.",
      "\"The church's first reaction [to these changes] was very negative. It was a great \u2018no\u2019 to modernity. By the end of the 19th century, I think, with a certain distance and a certain critical intelligence, the church was willing to enter into a more, call it, creative engagement with modernity. And I think Pope Leo the 13th represents precisely that,\" Barron said.",
      "The bishop pointed to the Rerum Novarum to further his point, an encyclical letter issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891.",
      "BEARS STAR CALEB WILLIAMS ISSUES TWO-WORDED REACTION TO POPE LEO XIV'S ELECTION",
      "\"In that document, [Leo XIII] is a fierce opponent of Marxism, a fierce opponent of socialism and communism, a great defender of private property and of the market economy,\" Barron said. \"So you say, 'Okay, there's that great \u2018no\u2019 to the left-wing economic revolutions.' At the same time, in that same letter, [Leo XIII] comes out strongly in favor of the right to form unions. He comes out very strongly in favor of what we call the universal destination of goods.\"",
      "Newly elected Pope Leo XIV (Right) took his papal name from the late-19th century Pope Leo XIII (Left). (Getty Images/Fox News)",
      "\"In fact, Pope Leo says in that letter, once the requirements of necessity and propriety have been met in your life, the rest of what you own belongs to the poor,\" Barron continued. \"That's not a just a standard, boring, mainstream point of view. That's a pretty revolutionary statement. But notice the lovely balance in that letter between \u2018yes\u2019 to private property, the great \u2018no\u2019 to socialism and Marxism, but the great \u2018yes\u2019 to the universal destination of goods. Leo sets the tone thereby for the rest of Catholic social teaching that followed him.\"",
      "In conclusion, Barron said he thinks Prevost's selection of Leo XIV makes the new pope \"a very interesting player\" in terms of the debate between the Right and the Left in politics.",

      "\"[Leo XIV] doesn't fit \u2013 and I've said this 1,000 times \u2013 he and other great representatives of Catholic social teaching don't fit into our categories of left and right,\" Barron said. \"They don't fit into Democrat-Republican, they're in a space beyond those distinctions. So, I think that's what's perhaps most interesting about him.\""

      "The challenges of brain surgery today",
      "Brain surgery is incredibly complex. The tools surgeons use today are often rigid and can only move in straight lines. This limits where they can safely operate. Many tumors or problematic areas in the brain are simply too risky to reach because they lie near regions responsible for critical functions like movement or speech.",
      "In some cases, surgeons have no choice but to leave tumors untreated because the risk of damage is too high. On top of that, many drugs cannot even reach certain parts of the brain because of the blood-brain barrier, leaving patients with limited treatment options.",

      "TEEN GOES FROM 10 NIGHTLY SEIZURES TO ZERO WITH BRAIN IMPLANT",
      "How the microrobot works",
      "Robeaut\u00e9\u2019s microrobot is designed to overcome these challenges. It is incredibly small, about three millimeters long, roughly the size of a grain of rice, and it enters the brain through a tiny incision just a millimeter wide. Unlike traditional tools, this robot does not move in straight lines. Instead, it can follow curved paths, gently pushing aside brain tissue as it goes. It uses rotating silicone rings at its tip to carefully shift tissue without causing damage. This movement is inspired by how tiny insects walk on water, using adhesion forces that dominate at such small scales.",
      "Inside the robot, there is a small compartment that holds miniature surgical tools. For example, when performing a biopsy, the microrobot uses a flexible needle and tiny forceps to collect tissue samples. These samples can be stored inside the device or pulled back through a cable connected to the robot. Beyond biopsies, the robot can also implant electrodes for conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease or deliver drugs directly to tumors. It even has sensors that send real-time information back to the surgeons, helping them monitor the procedure closely.",
      "What is really impressive is how the robot\u2019s path is planned. Using MRI scans combined with artificial intelligence, surgeons can map out safe routes that avoid sensitive brain areas. During surgery, they can adjust the robot\u2019s position in real time using ultrasound imaging mounted on the skull, achieving sub-millimeter precision.",

There were no major complications like bleeding, which suggests the device can safely navigate brain tissue. Robeaut\u00e9 plans to begin human clinical trials in 2026, focusing on microbiopsies of brain tumors. They also aim to expand into the U.S. market and seek FDA approval, with hopes of launching internationally by 2030.",

It could allow doctors to diagnose brain tumors earlier and treat them more effectively while reducing the risks associated with traditional surgery. Because it is minimally invasive, patients could experience faster recoveries and fewer side effects. Additionally, the ability to collect live data from inside the brain could accelerate research and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.",

It tackles one of the most difficult challenges in healthcare: how to safely access and treat the brain.

      "When sending photos from an iPhone to an Android phone, images often appear blurry or compressed due to differences in messaging protocols and compression methods. This issue arises because Apple uses SMS/MMS to send messages to Android devices, which compresses images due to size limitations. Additionally, iPhones often use the HEIC format, which may not be fully supported on Android devices, leading to compatibility issues and reduced quality.",

      "The industrialization of credential theft",
      "In 2024, cybersecurity researchers at Fortinet observed a staggering surge in stolen login data being traded on the dark web. Over 1.7 billion credentials were harvested not from old breaches but through active infections on users\u2019 devices.",
      "At the heart of this epidemic is a class of malware called infostealers, which are programs designed specifically to extract sensitive information like usernames, passwords, browser cookies, email logins, crypto wallets and session tokens. Unlike large-scale data breaches that target centralized databases, infostealers operate on individual machines. They don\u2019t break into a company\u2019s servers; they compromise the end user, often without the victim ever noticing.",
      "These logs are then aggregated and sold by initial access brokers, intermediaries who sell compromised credentials and access tokens to other cybercriminal groups, including ransomware operators. The market has matured to the point where access to a corporate VPN, an admin dashboard or even a personal bank account can be purchased at scale, with verified functionality and region-specific pricing.",
      "Fortinet\u2019s 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report identified a 500% increase in credential logs from infostealer infections over the past year. Among the most widespread and dangerous infostealers identified in the report are RedLine, Vidar and Raccoon.",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How infostealers work",
      "Infostealers are typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious browser extensions, fake software installers or cracked applications. Once installed on a device, they scan browser databases, autofill records, saved passwords and local files for any credential-related data. Many also look for digital wallets, FTP credentials and cloud service logins.",
      "Crucially, many infostealers also exfiltrate session tokens and authentication cookies, meaning that even users who rely on multifactor authentication are not entirely safe. With a stolen session token, an attacker can bypass multifactor authentication entirely and assume control of the session without ever needing to log in manually.",
      "Once collected, the data is uploaded to a command and control server. From there, it's either used directly by attackers or bundled into logs and sold on forums. These logs can include everything from the victim\u2019s IP address and geolocation to their browser fingerprint and full credential list, giving attackers everything they need to carry out further exploitation or impersonation.",

      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Our No. 1 pick has a\u00a0built-in\u00a0Data Breach Scanner that lets you check if your information has been exposed in known breaches.\u00a0Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The 1.7 billion passwords leaked in 2024 are not a relic of past breaches. They\u2019re evidence of an evolving, industrialized cybercrime economy built on the backs of unsuspecting users and quietly infected devices. The tools are cheap, the scale is massive and the impact is personal.

This includes cards with \"INDEF\" (indefinite) expiration dates, despite past confusion and software glitches.",
      "However, travelers have reported occasional issues at some airports, where TSA's system may misread the \"INDEF\" date as expired. In those cases, TSA officers may ask for another acceptable form of ID, such as a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or a passport. If you have no other ID, a supervisor may review your document and allow you to proceed, but expect possible delays.",

      "If you show up at the airport today with a standard driver's license that isn't REAL ID compliant, and you don't have a passport or other approved ID, you could face delays, extra screening or even be denied entry at the security checkpoint. TSA is urging travelers to check their IDs before heading to the airport.",
      "However, if you have a valid Global Entry card, you do not need to obtain a REAL ID-compliant driver's license to fly domestically after May 7, 2025. The Global Entry card is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Traveler card that meets federal identification standards and is explicitly accepted by TSA as an alternative to a REAL ID. This means you can use your Global Entry card at TSA checkpoints to verify your identity when flying within the United States. Other DHS Trusted Traveler cards, like NEXUS, SENTRI and FAST, are also accepted as alternatives.",

      "The safety of autonomous trucks is a primary concern.\u00a0Aurora's 2025 Driverless Safety Report outlines five key principles to ensure safe operation: proficiency, fail-safety, continuous improvement, resilience and trustworthiness. The company uses high-resolution cameras, radar and lidar to understand the environment, with their FirstLight lidar detecting objects from over 1,470 feet away, offering nearly nine seconds of reaction time at highway speeds.",
      "Aurora's fail-safe system includes multiple redundancies, while the company's approach to continuous improvement involves regular software updates and incident reviews. They've driven over 2.6 million miles autonomously, hauling over 9,500 commercial freight loads with a nearly 100% on-time rate and no major safety incidents.",
      "Safety case and validation",
      "Aurora's safety approach is evaluated through a \"safety case\" method, commonly used in aviation and nuclear industries. A third-party audit by T\u00dcV S\u00dcD validated Aurora's safety management system, confirming alignment with SAE International's level 4 and level 5 standards.

      "\"Simulations and supervised testing aren't enough,\" OOIDA states.\u00a0\"Phantom braking and unpredictable road conditions make autonomous trucks a risky proposition. Until there's mandatory, transparent oversight, these safety claims are premature.\"",
      "OOIDA also criticizes the lack of robust federal regulation, pointing to voluntary data programs like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) AV TEST as inadequate.",

He also noted that \"Teamsters are professional drivers who safely handle all conditions with miles driven in the real world.\"",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a\u00a0Second Amended Standing General Order 2021-01 requiring manufacturers and operators of vehicles with automated driving systems (ADS) or level 2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to report crashes to the agency.",
      "This order mandates the reporting of specific crash-related information when ADS or level 2 ADAS is engaged or was recently in use, enabling NHTSA to monitor potential safety defects in these vehicles and ensure compliance with safety standards. The goal is to proactively address safety concerns related to these technologies as they evolve, in accordance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "What this means for the future",
      "There are undeniable upsides. Autonomous trucks could operate 24/7, slash delivery times, reduce costs and help address the growing driver shortage. They may even improve road safety by eliminating accidents caused by human error. But risks remain. Public trust in driverless tech is still shaky. Many worry about what happens to jobs when machines take the wheel. The Teamsters are particularly vocal about this.",
      "\"Tens of millions of people turn a key for a living, but companies like Aurora couldn't care less if they lose their livelihoods. Eliminating all driving jobs would be disastrous for our communities and the middle class,\" McQuaid said.",
      "That said, a\u00a0Department of Transportation (DOT) study from the Trump administration projected long-haul autonomous trucking could increase U.S. employment by 26,400-35,100 jobs per year as new logistics and tech roles emerge. Aurora, for its part, claims both\u00a0human drivers and AVs are needed to meet demand.",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reveals that a new AirPlay bug lets hackers take over Apple devices via Wi-Fi with no clicks needed.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Apple's AirPlay was designed to make life easier, letting users stream music, photos and videos from iPhones and MacBooks to TVs, speakers and other compatible devices with just a tap. But now, cybersecurity researchers have revealed that this same convenience may be opening the door to hackers. A new set of vulnerabilities, collectively called AirBorne, could turn AirPlay-enabled gadgets into stealthy entry points for malware and network infiltration.",

      "A person holding an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Researchers at Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Oligo\u00a0recently disclosed AirBorne, a group of security flaws in Apple's proprietary AirPlay protocol. These bugs exist primarily in the AirPlay software development kit (SDK) used by third-party manufacturers to bring AirPlay support to smart TVs, speakers and other media devices. The security flaws mean if a hacker is on the same Wi-Fi network as a vulnerable device, they can hijack it without ever touching the device.",
      "From there, attackers could move laterally within a home or corporate network, silently hopping from one device to another. They might install malware or ransomware, disrupt operations or even lock users out of their own systems. In some cases, compromised devices could be added to a botnet, a network of hijacked machines working in unison for larger attacks. And because many smart gadgets come equipped with microphones, hackers could even turn them into tools for eavesdropping and surveillance.",
      "A woman scrolling on her smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "What is Apple doing about the AirBorne bugs?",
      "Apple has already patched the AirBorne bugs on its own devices and issued updates to third-party vendors. However, researchers warn that many third-party AirPlay-enabled products, possibly tens of millions, may never receive a fix, either because they do not auto-update or because vendors are slow or unwilling to release security patches.",
      "A striking demonstration by Oligo showed how easily a Bose speaker was taken over to display the firm's logo, proving how simple it could be for a hacker to silently gain control. Though Bose was not specifically targeted, the example highlights the broader risk. Any unpatched device using AirPlay SDK could be a gateway for malicious actors.",
      "The researchers also discovered that Apple CarPlay is affected. While exploiting it would be harder and would require Bluetooth or USB pairing, more than 800 car and truck models are potentially vulnerable.",

      "Steps to update your iPhone\u2019s software (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO UPDATE ALL OF YOUR DEVICES AND KEEP THEM SAFE",
      "5 ways to protect yourself from AirPlay hackers",
      "1) Set up a separate Wi-Fi network for smart devices:\u00a0Most modern routers allow you to create multiple networks. Use this feature to keep your smart home devices such as AirPlay-enabled speakers, TVs or receivers on a dedicated \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) network. Keep this separate from your main devices, like phones, laptops and work computers. This segmentation ensures that even if a hacker gains access to a vulnerable smart device, they cannot easily reach more critical or sensitive devices on the primary network.",
      "2) Disable AirPlay when not actively using it:\u00a0AirPlay is designed to always be on and discoverable, which makes it convenient but also leaves it exposed. If you rarely use AirPlay or only use it occasionally, go into your device settings and turn it off completely. On Apple devices, AirPlay settings can be found under \"General\" or \"AirPlay & Handoff.\" For third-party devices, check their companion apps or manuals. Turning off AirPlay removes it as an open door for attackers.",
      "3) Avoid using AirPlay on public or unsecured Wi-Fi and use a VPN:\u00a0One of the key conditions for exploiting AirBorne vulnerabilities is that the attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target device. This makes public Wi-Fi networks in places like caf\u00e9s, airports, hotels or shared workspaces particularly risky. If you need to use your device in such environments, avoid casting, streaming or pairing with smart devices.",
      "Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Strengthen and secure your home Wi-Fi network:\u00a0Make it more difficult for attackers to gain access to your home network. Use a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi that is different from your other account credentials. Ensure that your router firmware is updated and that encryption is set to WPA2 or WPA3. Avoid older and less secure options like WEP or open networks. Turn off features like WPS, which are designed for easy setup but can also make your network more vulnerable. If possible, disable universal plug and play (UPnP) and similar features that make all devices on your network easily discoverable. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Limit device permissions and exposure:\u00a0Smart devices with AirPlay support often include features like microphones, auto-pairing and remote access. Review each device's settings and disable any features you do not actively use. For example, if your smart speaker has a microphone, but you never use voice commands, turn off the microphone or cover it. The fewer functions a device has exposed, the fewer opportunities a hacker has to exploit it. If your router supports it, use device-level firewall rules to limit which services or internet connections your smart gadgets can access.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Apple likes to market itself as the go-to for privacy and security, but the AirBorne vulnerabilities show that the company's devices are far from bulletproof. While they patched their own products, millions of third-party AirPlay devices are still wide open to attack. It's becoming clear that Apple's control over its ecosystem isn't as tight as they'd like you to believe. If they really want to be the privacy leader, they need to step up and fix these issues across the board, not just when it suits them.",

      "The recent surge of attacks on Tesla owners, dealerships and charging stations has morphed into a broader campaign of intimidation, fueled by weaponized personal data. But the fallout isn't limited to Tesla owners alone.",
      "Sites like \"Dogequest\" have published names, addresses and phone numbers supposedly belonging to Tesla owners, yet many victims never owned a Tesla or sold theirs years ago. Some were misidentified due to errors in public records or outdated databases, turning ordinary people into targets for harassment and threats. The site's operators have even demanded proof of sale from anyone seeking removal, putting the burden on innocent people to clear their names.",
      "As the DOJ and FBI label these attacks as domestic terrorism and ramp up investigations, the chilling reality is that anyone, even those only suspected of owning a Tesla, can find themselves exposed and at risk.",

      "How innocent people get caught in the crossfire",
      "On March 18, 2025, a hacker group launched \"Dogequest,\" a website featuring a searchable map of supposed Tesla owners and employees. The site didn't just list dealerships and charging stations; it exposed names, home addresses, phone numbers and emails, sometimes even in real time. The twist? Many of the people listed never owned a Tesla at all.",
      "The data fueling this attack came from public vehicle registration records and third-party databases, notorious for their inaccuracies. Some victims had sold their Teslas years ago. Others were never owners, just mistakenly linked by a typo, a recycled phone number or a database error. Yet they found themselves on a digital hit list, with their privacy and safety at risk.",
      "The real-world consequences",
      "This isn't just an online problem. Firebombings at showrooms, bullets through dealership windows and threats to families have all been linked to these doxxing campaigns. Law enforcement, including the DOJ, now calls it domestic terrorism. And because the data is so often wrong, anyone could be next, regardless of whether you've ever set foot in a Tesla.",

      "Why misidentification matters to everyone",
      "If you think you're safe because you don't own a Tesla, think again. The same flawed data sources that misidentified Tesla owners exist for countless other products, memberships and affiliations.

Here are a few steps you can take to protect your data.",
      "Use two-factor authentication: Protect your vehicle\u2019s account and associated emails with\u00a0authenticator apps rather than SMS, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",

While Tesla claims footage isn\u2019t linked to identities by default, third-party app vulnerabilities could expose this data. Newer Teslas process cabin cam footage locally, but legacy models may still use cloud backups, so check your software version.",
      "Report doxxing or cyber harassment: If you\u2019ve been doxxed or targeted online, don\u2019t wait to take action. Report it to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3),\u00a0ic3.gov, or to local law enforcement, as many states have laws addressing doxxing, stalking and cyber harassment. File a police report with documented evidence (screenshots, URLs, timestamps). Also, for account-specific threats, contact Tesla customer service directly to report suspicious activity and secure your account.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The reality is unsettling but not hopeless, and while the threats of our hyper-connected world can feel overwhelming, you don\u2019t have to just hope you won\u2019t be targeted. You can take control by arming yourself with knowledge, using the right tools, building smart habits like checking your digital footprint, using removal tools and staying alert to new threats because the attackers are organized, and it\u2019s time we are, too.",

      "Kurt Knutsson discusses how a paper pill bottle could revolutionize pharmacy packaging and cut plastic waste drastically.",
      "Have you ever stopped to think about what happens to those little orange pill bottles after you finish your prescription? Every year, around 200 billion of these bottles are produced worldwide, and sadly most of them end up in landfills. In the U.S. alone, about 4 to 5 billion plastic pill bottles are thrown away each year.",
      "That\u2019s enough plastic to circle the Earth multiple times.",
      "While they might seem harmless, these bottles contribute significantly to the growing plastic pollution crisis because they\u2019re often not recycled properly.",

      "Paper Tully Tube pill bottles (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A paper bottle that\u2019s changing the game",
      "Plastic has become the go-to material for packaging, including in medicine, because it\u2019s cheap, durable and easy to produce. However, the environmental cost is huge, and the pharmaceutical industry has struggled to find a sustainable alternative.",
      "Enter the\u00a0Tully Tube, a revolutionary new pill bottle made mostly from 100% sustainably sourced paper. Developed by Parcel Health, this isn\u2019t just any paper bottle. It\u2019s the first one to meet the strict U.S. FDA regulations for food-contact packaging, making it safe to use for prescription medications.",
      "What makes the Tully Tube really impressive is how it balances sustainability with practicality. The body of the bottle is made from recyclable and compostable paper, which means it can break down naturally instead of piling up in landfills. The cap, which needs to be child-resistant for safety, is still made from plastic but uses recycled materials to reduce its environmental impact.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "STOP SORTING YOUR GARBAGE WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY",
      "How does it keep pills safe?",
      "You might be wondering how a paper bottle can protect pills from moisture, heat or damage during shipping. The Tully Tube uses a clever three-layer construction. It\u2019s coated with a food-safe compostable layer that keeps water and humidity out, ensuring your medication stays fresh and effective.",
      "When it\u2019s time to toss the bottle, a patented pull tab makes it easy to separate the paper body from the plastic cap and neck. This means the paper part can be composted or recycled, while the plastic pieces can be recycled separately. It\u2019s a simple but smart way to make sure every part of the bottle is handled properly at the end of its life.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "IS THIS TECHNOLOGY THE ANSWER TO CLEANING UP OUR OCEAN'S PLASTIC PROBLEM?",
      "Why should pharmacies care?",
      "One of the biggest hurdles for sustainable packaging is cost. Fortunately, the Tully Tube is priced competitively with traditional plastic bottles, so pharmacies don\u2019t have to pay more to go green. Plus, because the paper surface is easier and cheaper to print on, pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies can customize the bottles with logos, designs or even characters to make the packaging more engaging for customers.",
      "From an environmental perspective, the Tully Tube reduces carbon emissions by about 30% compared to plastic bottles. That\u2019s a significant cut in greenhouse gases, especially when you consider the billions of bottles used every year.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AUTONOMOUS TRASH-GOBBLING ROBO BOAT WAGES WAR ON WATERWAY WASTE",
      "Real-world impact",
      "UVA Health is already leading the way by rolling out Tully Tubes across its system. This move is expected to eliminate millions of plastic bottles from their waste stream, showcasing how sustainable packaging can work even in industries with strict safety and regulatory standards. Their example proves that eco-friendly alternatives aren\u2019t just theoretical, they\u2019re ready for real-world use today.",

      "The Tully Tube may seem like a small innovation, but it has the potential to make a huge environmental difference. It challenges the longstanding reliance on plastic in the pharmaceutical industry by offering a practical, safe and sustainable alternative. As more hospitals and pharmacies consider adopting this new packaging, the impact could be enormous.",

Given our broken sentencing scheme, that guy would have been paroled in probably less than four years, and that seemed wholly unacceptable to me and everybody that looked at this case,\" Brauchler continued.",

Eric Henderson, who was accused of hit-and-run, vehicular homicide and drunken driving resulting in the death of Colorado State Trooper Jaimie Jursevics in November 2015. (Andy Cross/Denver Post via Getty Images)",
      "To ensure that justice was served, Brauchler said his office got a \"little aggressive\" and charged the driver with first-degree murder based on \"extreme indifference.\"",
      "\"We pursued it. And I'm not going to tell you it didn't have risks. I'm not going to tell you that I didn't have a pit in my stomach. But in about three and a half hours of deliberation after about a weeklong trial, the jury came back and said, \u2018Yeah, guilty of first-degree murder,\u2019 and we're all pretty satisfied with that outcome,\" Brauchler said.",
      "Brauchler added what this case also highlighted was that he feels \"we have lost sight of the purpose of the criminal justice system and taken our eye off the ball on day-to-day crimes,\" like DUI.",
      "\"One thing about this is that there is no time of day, no road you can drive on that you can say, 'Well, I'm safe from drunk drivers at this time on this road.' My God, this was Sunday. On a road in the middle of Castle Rock, not a highway, on a road but across the street from the Douglas County Fair. If we don't, I think, vigilantly attack this problem as much as any other, maybe more so, we're going to see more of this, and this is the most preventable crime there is. This guy chose to risk people's lives, and now he's going to lose his freedom,\" Brauchler said.",
      "Brauchler said Anderson's wife and children have recovered, but the ripple effects of witnessing the horrific scene are \"still unknown as to how far they stretch through their lives.\"",
      "\"How does seeing the violent death of their father in front of them, the way they saw him lying in the parking lot with a massive head injury, missing his leg above the ankle, how does that haunt them throughout the rest of their lives? I don't think anybody knows,\" Brauchler said.",

      "\"I have spoken with the widow many times. She is resilient and tough, but you can also see there's something missing in her eyes. I don't know how better to describe it, but I've seen it a lot with loss like this and that blue flame that flickers back there that tells you somebody's fully engaged is just a little more diminished. It's a little harder to see. And my hope for that family is that they can figure out a way to find happiness even without Col. Anderson.\"",
      "Tom Mustin, director of media relations for Brauchler's office, told Fox News Digital that \"typically, DUI cases lead to vehicular homicide charges, but this case set a new precedent and reflects DA Brauchler's tough-on-crime approach that helped win him the office.\"",
      "\"I don't shy away from the description \u2018tough on crime,\u2019 but when did simply enforcing the law and having an expectation that there would be accountability for breaking it become \u2018tough on [crime]?'\" Brauchler said. \"That just tells you how far we've shifted away from the idea of personal responsibility for criminal conduct. But I'm proud of the position we've taken. It's been well-received everywhere. And I mean not just in our jurisdiction, but when I go to other jurisdictions.\"",

      "Brauchler added that when he started working in his field 30 years ago and had this same messaging, it would have been a \"yawn fest.\"",
      "\"People would have been like, 'Duh, that's what prosecutors and police do.' But that's how far we've shifted in the other direction,\" Brauchler said.",
      "When asked about other high-profile cases like the Menendez brothers' case in California, Brauchler said \"there's no good message that comes out of these two ever walking out of prison.\"",
      "\"I remember when these cases happened, and I followed them like everybody else,\" Brauchler said. \"But this was a brutal, planned murder for the most selfish reasons possible. Anything they come up with at this point, by way of excuse, has already been air-dried in front of the jury and rejected when they were convicted. There's no good message for America that comes out of these guys ever taking a free breath again.\"",
      "Brauchler said what is troubling about the Menendez brothers' case being brought back up is that \"every time something like this happens and someone sees any amount of success, it encourages others to do this.\"",
      "James Holmes (AP)",
      "\"You have to believe that there are any number of defense attorneys out there who are willing to shoot for the notoriety or the paycheck. In order to try to capture something like this, I'm not denigrating them. I know that's business, but the answer should be that we should forget about the Menendez brothers.\"",
      "Brauchler said what the Menendez brothers' case highlights is something that has been happening since the Aurora theater shooting that is amplifying killers.",
      "\"There has been a real concerted effort by decent people and many in the media to no longer amplify the killers; like, we should be focused on the victims. I would say since the Aurora theater shooter, I've said that guy's name maybe four times through the whole trial, which lasted from Jan. 20th until April 7th, 2015. I said his name exactly twice. And that was by design,\" Brauchler explained.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"And so here we are again, focused on the Menendez brothers and the Netflix things about the Menendez brothers. And I understand that, but we should really de-glorify the criminals and focus more on the victims and the crime that was committed. And I think that if you let these guys out, you do the opposite.\"",
      "Brauchler added that there are even studies now about the\u00a0correlation between the amount of notoriety that a criminal gets and then copycat-type crimes.",
      "\"I'll give you an example with Columbine. The STEM school mass shooting that I covered, both of those shooters had passing fascination with those Columbine shooters. We had a near-mass shooting at another high school right down the road from my kid's high school. They both had a fascination with the Columbine shooters and the Aurora theater shooter. Guess which case he researched before he left his apartment back on July the 19th to go murder these people? Columbine. So, the more notorious an event or some people become, it does have an effect on other folks,\" Brauchler said.",
      "\"I get it, we have to report the bad guy or bad girl at least once,\" Brauchler continued. \"Then after that, let's not talk about them anymore. Let's talk about the crime. Let's talk about the victims, and let's go to court.\"",

      "Berisha\u2019s race has been fraught by other complications, including being stripped of his legal immunity in December 2023 and held under house arrest until November 2024. Berisha is currently awaiting trial on corruption charges.",
      "Berisha told Fox News Digital that the charges were the product of lawfare leveled against him by Rama and Soros.",
      "Berisha is not the only opposition candidate who has faced charges in the lead-up to elections. Former Albanian president Ilir Meta was also arrested on corruption allegations in October 2024.",

      "Nesho claimed that \"the Albanian people are being denied the basic democratic rights to organize, vote, and oppose the government without fear. This system of repression, critics say, is supported\u2014either tacitly or directly\u2014by elements of the Biden administration and global actors like Alex Soros, who have worked to undercut the opposition and prevent free and fair elections, much like the political persecution seen in the United States against former President Donald Trump.\"",
      "Saying that the \"election could mark a turning point,\" as \"a true grassroots movement is rising\u2014ready to challenge state corruption and restore Albania\u2019s path to freedom, development, and democratic self-determination,\" Nesho called \"on the Trump administration to closely monitor these elections and send a clear message to Tirana: America is watching.\"",

      "The leaders, from France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland, said the proposal to start the ceasefire on Monday was supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, whom they had briefed over the phone earlier in the day.

They included French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who on Saturday traveled to Ukraine together for the first time.",

      "The Parolin-brokered deal was and remains a controversial agreement between the leaders of the Catholic Church and the CCP, which has long oppressed Catholics across China.",
      "While the agreement was championed by the late Pope Francis and his secretary of state, Parolin \u2014 the Vatican\u2019s top diplomat \u2014 as a step toward \"normalizing\" Catholicism in the communist nation, experts argue it has brought dangerous consequences for the faithful.",

      "Under this agreement, all Catholic clergy are required to register with the CCP\u2019s Patriotic Association \u2014 which was created in 1957 and was long rejected by the Catholic Church as illegitimate because it required that all clergy reject foreign influence, including that of the pope.",
      "Parolin in 2019 said the aim of this agreement was \"to advance religious freedom in the sense of finding normalization for the Catholic community.\"",
      "Details of the deal remain unclear because it has been kept secret, explained Shea.",

      "The ban effectively blocks the continuation of the Catholic Church in China.",

    "summary": "Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel are \"worried about any deal\" President Trump might strike with Iran, one source told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0When President Donald Trump took office in January, he and Israeli Prime\u00a0Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were closely aligned on how to approach the most pressing issues in their relationship: the war in Gaza and aggression from Iran.",
      "Trump lifted a hold the Biden administration had put on sending large bombs to Israel. He encouraged Israeli military operations \u201cto finish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza. He agreed with Netanyahu on confronting Iran and its proxy groups in the region.",
      "But in recent weeks, the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu has become strained as the two leaders are increasingly at odds over a strategy for tackling these challenges now that Hamas has been significantly degraded and Iran weakened, according to two U.S. officials, two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "Where Netanyahu sees an opportunity to finally take out Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, Trump sees an opportunity to remove the threat of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon by making a deal. As Israel hits Gaza with a new military offensive, Trump is pushing for a ceasefire and looking to implement his postwar plan for rebuilding the area into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d And after Trump halted the U.S. military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthi militant group, a shocked Netanyahu said Israel would then defend itself.",
      "The recent differences between the two leaders on key strategies and positions has put Trump\u2019s relationship with one of America\u2019s closest allies at a bit of a crossroads. How they navigate their disagreements going forward will shape the outcome of some of the core components of the president\u2019s foreign policy agenda.",
      "Twice in just this past week alone, Trump made public comments that rankled Netanyahu, the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions said.",
      "Netanyahu\u00a0was particularly upset when Trump said Wednesday that\u00a0he had yet to decide\u00a0whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium under a new nuclear deal his administration is negotiating, the two U.S. officials said. A top adviser to Netanyahu, Ron Dermer, conveyed that message to Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, during a meeting at the White House on Thursday, according to\u00a0one of the\u00a0U.S. officials.",
      "For his part, Trump has been frustrated with Netanyahu\u2019s decision to begin a new military offensive in Gaza, which the president sees as at odds with his plan for rebuilding there, according to one of the U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the tensions between the two leaders.",
      "Privately, Trump has said the new Israeli offensive in Gaza is a wasted effort because it will make it harder to rebuild, according to those two sources.",
      "The U.S. is currently pushing Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza, which Dermer was set to discuss with Witkoff during his White House visit this week, according to the Middle Eastern diplomats and a senior Trump administration official.",
      "But\u00a0Trump\u2019s approach to Iran has been the biggest point of contention for Netanyahu.",
      "The Israeli leader has been frustrated for weeks with Trump\u2019s refusal to support military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and his decision to instead\u00a0try to reach a deal aimed at blocking Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, according to the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re worried about any deal,\u201d one of the U.S. officials said of the Israelis.",
      "Israel has made clear to the U.S. that it does not want Trump to cut a nuclear deal that leaves Iran with any uranium enrichment capabilities, the U.S. officials and Middle Eastern diplomats said. Trump has expressed an openness to Iran maintaining a civilian nuclear program.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t made that decision yet,\u201d Trump said Wednesday when asked if the U.S. position is that Iran can have a uranium enrichment program for civilian nuclear purposes.",
      "\u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump,\u201d\u00a0James Hewitt, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement responding to this story. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East. As he has repeatedly stated in his first and second terms, the president is committed to ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "A third U.S. official said the president\u2019s team has communicated with Israeli officials regularly about the status of negotiations with Iran, providing updates and coordinating on elements of a potential deal.",
      "Netanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u2018Trump has his own agenda\u2019",
      "Netanyahu was\u00a0blindsided \u2014 and infuriated \u2014\u00a0this past week\u00a0by Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. was halting its military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen after the\u00a0Houthis\u00a0agreed to stop firing on U.S. ships in the Red Sea, according to\u00a0one of the U.S. officials and\u00a0the\u00a0two Middle East diplomats.",
      "The Houthis had just attacked Israel with a missile that hit close to Ben Gurion, Israel\u2019s main airport.",
      "When Netanyahu visited the White House last month, for the second time since Trump took office,\u00a0he hoped\u00a0the president\u00a0would pledge U.S. air support for a possible Israeli operation against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, according to the two Middle Eastern diplomats. The Israeli leader was taken aback when the president instead announced he would agree to direct talks with Tehran, the diplomats said.",
      "Netanyahu has privately said\u00a0he thinks\u00a0Trump\u2019s negotiations with Iran are a waste of time because Tehran will never hold up its end of any deal, according to the two U.S. officials. Israel has argued that Iran is so weakened by economic sanctions and the degradation of its proxies in the region that now is an ideal moment to take out its nuclear facilities, and it is concerned the window for doing so is closing while the U.S. negotiates, the officials said.",
      "Adding to that concern about timing,\u00a0Israeli military strikes\u00a0crippled Iranian strategic air defenses in October,\u00a0meaning manned aircraft conducting new strikes now\u00a0would not be as susceptible to being shot down. But the Iranians are rebuilding their air defenses.",
      "Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham said this week that the only acceptable Iran deal is one that completely stops Tehran from any uranium enrichment. They also urged Trump to submit any Iran nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification, which requires a two-thirds majority vote.",
      "Asked about Cotton and Graham\u2019s comments, a fourth U.S. official said Witkoff is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Graham about Iran negotiations and briefed Cotton on them this past week.",
      "The 2015 Iran nuclear deal reached by President Barack Obama was not ratified by the Senate, which allowed Trump to simply withdraw the U.S. from the agreement during his first term.",
      "\u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is the Israelis recognizing that as much as they welcomed the election of President Trump and thought that would really give them a blank check to pursue whatever agenda they wanted, Trump has his own agenda,\u201d Frank Lowenstein,\u00a0a former Middle East envoy under the Obama administration,\u00a0said during a virtual briefing organized by J Street, an advocacy organization that describes itself as pro-Israel and pro-peace.",
      "Although Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Iran and the U.S. deal with the Houthis are \u201canathema\u201d to Netanyahu, the prime minister does not have the political leverage in Washington or Israel to enter into a direct confrontation with Trump, who is popular with\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s\u00a0base in Israel, said Ilan Goldenberg, who worked on Middle East policy\u00a0as a senior official during\u00a0the Biden and Obama administrations.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cwhole political strategy and survival strategy is based on holding his coalition and holding his political base together,\u201d Goldenberg said in the briefing organized by J Street. \u201cAnd those folks love Trump, so for him to go very publicly against Trump is something he really can\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "The strain\u00a0in\u00a0the relationship between\u00a0Trump and\u00a0Netanyahu comes as the president is set\u00a0to\u00a0travel to the Middle East next week, with stops\u00a0scheduled\u00a0in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Trump\u00a0is not currently scheduled\u00a0to visit Israel\u00a0on this trip, though he did during his first term.",
      "Witkoff also\u00a0planned to\u00a0attend another round of negotiations with Iran this weekend in Oman."

      "The fatal nighttime flight on Feb. 6, 2024, occurred during a routine training mission and as a winter storm brought days of heavy rain and snow to the San Diego area.",
      "An investigation report released this week shows that pilot error was the root cause of the crash, with icing conditions and low cloud cover being contributing factors. But investigators said they could only make assumptions since they had not found the aircraft\u2019s memory cards that contain flight and maintenance data and because the helicopter did not have what\u2019s known as a crash survivable flight data recorder.",
      "The device, also known as a \u201cblack box,\u201d would have provided key information, such as altitude and speed, and would have helped investigators reconstruct the events leading up to the incident,\u00a0 according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Federal law requires large commercial aircraft and some smaller ones to have one.",

      "\u201cThey have no flight data. They have no recordings, none of anything,\u201d said Langen, 56, of Chandler, Arizona. \u201cThis is 2025, and we\u2019re flying with equipment that\u2019s from the mid-\u201980s.\u201d",
      "Langen, who was also a Marine aviator, said he urged the Marines to add the technology to all Super Stallions, which he said would help aviators glean useful information about weather, terrain and decision-making. But he said the Marines told him that doing so would be too expensive.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re putting a price tag on a service member\u2019s life,\u201d Langen said. \u201cFor me, as a dad and a Marine who did this job, it really hurts. That hurts on a level that it\u2019s hard to put into words.\u201d"

      "Inside a 90-square-mile stretch of rural reservation between the eastern Jemez Mountains and the banks of the Rio Grande River sits the Santa Clara Pueblo Community Library, an anchor for the northern New Mexico tribe it serves.",
      "Internet service across the Santa Clara Pueblo reservation is sparse, the tribe\u2019s governor, James Naranjo, told NBC News, and resources to expand access to technology and literacy programs for its 1,700 members are already stretched thin.",
      "Naranjo said the library relies on federal grant money to build bridges between the tribe and otherwise out-of-reach services \u2014 grants that could be on the chopping block thanks to cuts by the Trump administration.",
      "The Pueblo\u2019s was one of more than a hundred libraries on federally recognized tribal lands across the country that were notified by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) \u2014 a small federal agency responsible for funding local libraries and museums across the country \u2014 that their congressionally appropriated grant had been terminated midcycle, according to an IMLS spokesperson.",
      "\u201cIMLS has determined that your grant is unfortunately no longer consistent with the agency\u2019s priorities and no longer serves the interest of the United States and the IMLS Program,\u201d one letter, obtained by NBC News from a tribal grant writer who received it, said. \u201cIMLS is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "The letter was signed by Deputy Labor Secretary Keith Sonderling, whom President Donald Trump appointed as acting director of the IMLS in March. Days before Sonderling\u2019s appointment, Trump signed an executive order directing the agency, and six others, to be eliminated to the \u201cmaximum extent consistent with applicable law.\u201d Only Congress holds the legal authority to shut down the agency.",
      "Trump\u2019s March 14 order instructed the IMLS \u2014 which guarantees states and sovereign tribes can provide the public with free access to myriad services like early literacy resources, Braille books, internet access and STEM and cultural programs \u2014 to cease all operations, slash staff and provide a report to the Office of Management and Budget detailing proof of compliance.",
      "Within days, the Department of Government Efficiency descended upon the 75-person IMLS staff. All but a dozen were placed on administrative leave. Then, in early April, Sonderling terminated all IMLS grants except for those missed by human error, an IMLS spokesperson told NBC News.",
      "The spokesperson said the grants were terminated for evaluation purposes, and that some of them would be reinstated if they align with the administration\u2019s priorities, but declined to provide details on the timeline and criteria.",
      "The sweeping grant cancellations were part of a broader effort by Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to drastically reduce the scope of federal spending by freezing funds and ordering mass layoffs across a number of agencies, including the Department of Education, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "The American Library Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the largest union representing library employees, sued Sonderling, Trump and DOGE to stop the dismantling of the IMLS last month.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon granted a temporary restraining order last week that bars the Trump administration from making further cuts to IMLS staff and grants.",
      "An injunction granted Tuesday in a separate lawsuit brought by 21 state attorneys general against the Trump administration cemented that the IMLS cannot be downsized any further, but as litigation continues ahead of a final ruling, the future of the grants is still up in the air. And in his 2026 budget outline, Trump proposed defunding the IMLS entirely.",
      "Tribal leaders worry that it could mean the end of library services their constituents rely on, and the beginning of a very long fight.",
      "\u201cThis is something that\u2019s personal to me,\u201d said American Library Association President Cindy Hohl, a member of the Santee Sioux Nation of South Dakota, which said it had its Native American Basic Grant canceled.",
      "\u201cAs we continue to look at what is happening in the current government, we need to advocate for the needs of our sovereign nations,\u201d Hohl said. \u201cWe need to hold the federal government accountable to upholding their trust responsibility.\u201d",
      "\u201cTribal libraries and tribal communities have specific needs to preserve their culture, their language, their heritage, and to live as traditional people in our traditional communities,\u201d Hohl added.",
      "Among the initial cuts were four grant programs designed specifically to support library and museum services in rural Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian communities.",
      "Thousands of miles from New Mexico, the only library within miles of the 68-person Igiugig Village tribe in southwestern Alaska was stripped of the funding it relies on to purchase books and sustain its summer reading program. In Juneau, funding for a project dedicated to digitizing and preserving the history of Native Alaska was slashed. Across Indian Country, the federal dollars that funded tribal librarian and coordinator salaries have run dry, putting the jobs and the programs they run in jeopardy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that these cuts are nationwide, and it\u2019s hurting our children,\u201d Naranjo said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s hurting our unborn. It\u2019s hurting our community in general. Yeah, $10,000 might be a small amount to others, but it\u2019s a huge amount to us.\u201d",
      "The Santa Clara Pueblo received $10,000 last year through the Native American Library Services Basic Grants program, which is designed to provide small, hard-to-reach Native American and Indigenous communities with access to funding that addresses the individual needs of each tribe. In the absence of the grants they were promised, Naranjo and tribal leaders across the country may have to make difficult decisions to keep their local libraries and museums afloat.",
      "\u201cOur library is our vault,\u201d said Santa Clara Pueblo Lt. Gov. Charles Suazo, who previously served as library coordinator, a position made possible by the IMLS grant money and which is now at risk unless the tribe dips into other areas of its budget to sustain the salary. \u201cIt holds our traditional language, some old pictures, some relics from the past. \u2026 Without this, all that could be lost.\u201d",
      "The Santa Clara Pueblo and the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo near Santa Fe, New Mexico, share the traditional Tewa language, which is considered endangered by Native language experts. An IMLS-funded project at the P\u2019oe Tsawa Community Library in Ohkay Owingeh teaches Tewa to tribal youth in an effort to preserve it, but it could be on the chopping block if the grant money isn\u2019t fully restored.",
      "\u201cThese are really critical services,\u201d Ohkay Owingeh Lt. Gov. Matthew Martinez said. \u201cI mean, our library, physically, is at the center of our tribal community in rural northern New Mexico.\u201d",
      "The IMLS, created in 1996 and which Trump himself reauthorized in 2018, last year announced $5.9 million in grants across 173 total grants awarded to Native American and Indigenous tribes, according to a statement from the agency. Congress appropriated $294.8 million to the agency in 2024.",
      "Whether the president has the authority to stop the flow of the federal dollars Congress appropriated, and the IMLS already awarded, is at the center of the appeals some tribal leaders and grant managers are making to Sonderling in hopes of a lifeline for their community service projects.",
      "The Makah Tribe in Neah Bay, Washington, is home to the Makah Cultural and Research Center, which could be left on the hook for large portions of the $149,779 Native American Library Enhancement Grant it was awarded. The grant funds hadn\u2019t been reimbursed in full by the IMLS when the grant was terminated halfway through its life cycle last month, according to Janine Ledford, the executive director of the Makah Cultural and Research Center.",
      "\u201cThis project has been empowering individuals on their journey toward wellness in response to an alarming opioid epidemic on the Makah Reservation,\u201d Ledford wrote in an appeal letter sent to Sonderling on May 7 and shared with NBC News. \u201cThe MCRC has been open since 1979 and has never had any federal awards offered, accepted and then revoked.\u201d",
      "Tribal leaders said the sprawling violation of contracts between the federal government and sovereign tribal nations opens up centuries-old wounds.",
      "\u201cIf you look at history, the federal government, you know, put our parents and grandparents in boarding schools. Language was not taught,\u201d said Martinez, the Ohkay Owingeh lieutenant governor. \u201cWe were punished for speaking [our] language, so we\u2019ve built momentum to privilege the use of language and incorporate it in everything that we do.\u201d"

      "The new research is the first time scientists have documented such complexity in a nonhuman communication system, and they think that the chimpanzees\u2019 abilities represent an evolutionary transition point between rudimentary animal communication and human language.",
      "\u201cGenerating new or combined meanings by combining words is a hallmark of human language,\u201d Catherine Crockford, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology who co-directs the Tai Chimpanzee Project, said in a news release. \u201cIt is crucial to investigate whether a similar capacity exists in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos.\u201d",
      "A separate study, published last month, provided similar evidence that bonobos, another primate, can also combine their calls to modify calls and form phrases. Together, these studies suggest both species evolved to develop fundamental building blocks of human language.",
      "Bonobos and chimpanzees are the species most closely related to humans in evolutionary history, which means all three species could have evolved from a common ancestor with this ability, a theory that could help researchers understand how human language developed.",
      "\u201cOur findings suggest a highly generative vocal communication system, unprecedented in the animal kingdom, which echoes recent findings in bonobos suggesting that complex combinatorial capacities were already present in the common ancestor of humans and these two great ape species,\u201d C\u00e9dric Girard-Buttoz, a researcher with the ENES bioacoustics research lab and the first author of the study, said in a news release.",
      "The researchers discovered these new complexities in chimpanzees\u2019 vocal system by following particular animals in the field from dawn to dusk for about 12 hours each day, recording the sounds the chimpanzees made and the responses from others in the group.\u00a0They recorded more than 4,300 vocalizations from 53 wild chimpanzees.",
      "During the chimps\u2019 vocal calls, the researchers also tracked what  activities, social interactions and environmental changes were occurring, and noted if the animals\u00a0were eating, playing or encountering a predator, for example.",
      "Then, the researchers performed a statistical analysis of specific two-call combinations \u2014 such as a grunt followed by a bark \u2014 that were documented in multiple animals.",
      "The researchers found that chimpanzees combined calls in all of their daily aspects of life and that the combinations could express a wide variety of meanings.",
      "Simon Townsend, a professor at the University of Zurich who studies cognition in primates and contributed to the bonobo research but was not involved in this study, said the paper is the first to show chimpanzees using several different mechanisms that are considered to be among the building blocks of language.",
      "He said the evidence does suggest that the common evolutionary ancestor of bonobos, humans and chimpanzees probably had this ability, too.",
      "\u201cIt does seem to suggest that our linguistic abilities were already well on the way to evolving ... 6-7 million years ago,\u201d Townsend said, referring to when the species likely branched off from one another in the evolutionary tree.",
      "Not all primates show evidence of such complicated communication. Forest monkeys, which have relatively simple social groups, mostly use vocalizations to manage predatory threats, Townsend said.",
      "But he thinks the formation of increasingly large and complicated social groups \u2014 an element common to great ape species and humans \u2014 likely spurred the evolution of more complex communication and eventually the ability to form language.",
      "For bonobos and chimpanzees, \u201cthe biggest challenge for them is navigating their complex social world. They live in much larger groups. \u2026 There\u2019s aggression, there\u2019s reconciliation, there\u2019s territoriality, there\u2019s intergroup interactions, and vocalizations, I think, is one evolutionary solution to trying to manage these complex and fine-grained social interactions,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "In human language, syntax is the set of rules that creates a system capable of expressing an infinite number of meanings.",
      "\u201cSyntax is all about providing more and more precise, refined information. And you probably only need to do that when your social interactions get more complex,\u201d Townsend said."

    "story": [
      "\u201cNobody does drama like the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church,\u201d said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, shortly after emerging from the conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV on Thursday.",
      "The quick decision, made some 33 hours after the Sistine Chapel's doors closed and the cardinals went into sequestration, was a sign that they likely entered the conclave with enough unity around the decision to continue Francis' legacy that they did not have to spend days tussling over a new direction for the Vatican.",
      "In the weeks ahead of the conclave, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, Archbishop of Newark, said in a joint press conference with five other American cardinals on Friday. \u201cWe listened to each other. What does the church need? What does the world need? What are we hoping for? What are we dreaming about?\u201d",
      "Leo, previously Cardinal Robert Prevost, a U.S. native with Peruvian citizenship and deep ties to Latin America, is described by the Vatican as the \u201csecond pope from the Americas,\u201d to Francis\u2019 first. He is known to have been close to the late pontiff, both in their daily dealings at the Vatican, and ideologically.",
      "Like Francis, Leo is known for his concern for the poor and marginalized, and in his first Sunday blessing as pope, quoted Francis and called for ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza, the subjects of Francis' final message to the world.",
      "The conclave is shrouded in secrecy, and many of the dealings that lead up to it remain in the shadows, but since the end of the conclave some cardinals have offered glimpses to what happened in the hours that led up to Leo\u2019s election.",
      "Once the Sistine Chapel's doors close, the cardinals swear an oath of \"absolute and perpetual secrecy,\" as do all\u00a0Vatican\u00a0staff assisting them, including cooks, cleaners and drivers. Mobile phones are confiscated, an ancient reason for a digital detox that at least one cardinal, Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, appreciated for giving him \u201cmore time on my hands just to be prayerful, just to reflect, just to be still, rather than being constantly agitated,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On the first evening, the cardinals cast their first round votes, but black smoke billowed from the chimney, meaning no pope was chosen.",
      "The cardinals adjourned for the night to Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse were most of them were staying \u2014 and eating. Cardinal Wilton Gregory said that \"a lot of dialog occurred at mealtime, coffee breaks, those moments when you can engage in smaller groups.\"",
      "\u201cThe only method is the human method, to get to talk to another, the dialogue, to listen to one another,\" Cardinal Robert McElroy, Archbishop of Washington, said, about the conversations that eventually lead to the two-thirds majority required to elect a pope.",
      "The next morning the cardinals returned to the Sistine Chapel and two more ballots were cast, but black smoke emerged once again.",
      "\u201cVoting is like watching a glacier move, but sometimes glaciers under stress move a lot faster,\u201d Tobin said.",
      "Despite wide speculation on pabalili in the wake of Francis' death, once the conclave began, we don't know who the other frontrunners were, or why they fell behind. But Dolan told CNN that Prevost's name had begun to emerge from relative obscurity even before the conclave began. And he continued to confer with his brother cardinals into the conclave.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that he stood up and made this overwhelmingly convincing speech that just wowed,\u201d said Gregory. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any particular intervention, but I do believe he engaged quite effectively in the smaller group conversations.\u201d",
      "And while conclaves in centuries past could stretch for weeks, Prevost's election began to take shape on the second day.",
      "Or as Gregory framed it: \u201cThere was a great movement on the second day, a great movement within the body that was there and there could be nothing other than the grace of God moving us toward this consensus.\"",
      "\u201cWhat I experience is that everything begins in politics and finishes mystic,\u201d added McElroy.",
      "Tobin recalled the moment after casting his vote. \u201cI walked back and I took a look at Bob, and because his name had been floating around, and he had his head in his hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI was praying for him, because I couldn\u2019t imagine what happens to a human being when you\u2019re facing something like that.\u201d",
      "During a press conference on Saturday, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, himself considered one of the leading candidates for pope, said he was seated next to Prevost.",
      "In the minutes after his election, when the new pope was gasping for air as the weight of his new role descended on him, Tagle said he asked him if he wanted a piece of candy. Prevost accepted and Tagle pulled one from a pocket beneath his cardinal\u2019s robe, \u201cthat\u2019s my first act of charity,\" he said he told Prevost, jokingly, \"for our new Holy Father.\u201d",
      "Soon after, Prevost emerged on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica as Pope Leo XIV, proof of an efficient and sucessful conclave.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t our first rodeo,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this 268 times.\u201d"

      "The fatal nighttime flight on Feb. 6, 2024, occurred during a routine training mission and as a winter storm brought days of heavy rain and snow to the San Diego area.",
      "An investigation report released this week shows that pilot error was the root cause of the crash, with icing conditions and low cloud cover being contributing factors. But investigators said they could only make assumptions since they had not found the aircraft\u2019s memory cards that contain flight and maintenance data and because the helicopter did not have what\u2019s known as a crash survivable flight data recorder.",
      "The device, also known as a \u201cblack box,\u201d would have provided key information, such as altitude and speed, and would have helped investigators reconstruct the events leading up to the incident,\u00a0 according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Federal law requires large commercial aircraft and some smaller ones to have one.",
      "The CH-53E Super Stallion that was carrying five young Marines, including one new father and another newlywed, did not have one, though some Marine helicopters do.",

    "summary": "Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel are \"worried about any deal\" President Trump might strike with Iran, one source told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0When President Donald Trump took office in January, he and Israeli Prime\u00a0Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were closely aligned on how to approach the most pressing issues in their relationship: the war in Gaza and aggression from Iran.",
      "Trump lifted a hold the Biden administration had put on sending large bombs to Israel. He encouraged Israeli military operations \u201cto finish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza. He agreed with Netanyahu on confronting Iran and its proxy groups in the region.",
      "But in recent weeks, the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu has become strained as the two leaders are increasingly at odds over a strategy for tackling these challenges now that Hamas has been significantly degraded and Iran weakened, according to two U.S. officials, two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "Where Netanyahu sees an opportunity to finally take out Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, Trump sees an opportunity to remove the threat of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon by making a deal. As Israel hits Gaza with a new military offensive, Trump is pushing for a ceasefire and looking to implement his postwar plan for rebuilding the area into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d And after Trump halted the U.S. military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthi militant group, a shocked Netanyahu said Israel would then defend itself.",
      "The recent differences between the two leaders on key strategies and positions has put Trump\u2019s relationship with one of America\u2019s closest allies at a bit of a crossroads. How they navigate their disagreements going forward will shape the outcome of some of the core components of the president\u2019s foreign policy agenda.",
      "Twice in just this past week alone, Trump made public comments that rankled Netanyahu, the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions said.",
      "Netanyahu\u00a0was particularly upset when Trump said Wednesday that\u00a0he had yet to decide\u00a0whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium under a new nuclear deal his administration is negotiating, the two U.S. officials said. A top adviser to Netanyahu, Ron Dermer, conveyed that message to Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, during a meeting at the White House on Thursday, according to\u00a0one of the\u00a0U.S. officials.",
      "For his part, Trump has been frustrated with Netanyahu\u2019s decision to begin a new military offensive in Gaza, which the president sees as at odds with his plan for rebuilding there, according to one of the U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the tensions between the two leaders.",
      "Privately, Trump has said the new Israeli offensive in Gaza is a wasted effort because it will make it harder to rebuild, according to those two sources.",
      "The U.S. is currently pushing Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza, which Dermer was set to discuss with Witkoff during his White House visit this week, according to the Middle Eastern diplomats and a senior Trump administration official.",
      "But\u00a0Trump\u2019s approach to Iran has been the biggest point of contention for Netanyahu.",
      "The Israeli leader has been frustrated for weeks with Trump\u2019s refusal to support military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and his decision to instead\u00a0try to reach a deal aimed at blocking Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, according to the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re worried about any deal,\u201d one of the U.S. officials said of the Israelis.",
      "Israel has made clear to the U.S. that it does not want Trump to cut a nuclear deal that leaves Iran with any uranium enrichment capabilities, the U.S. officials and Middle Eastern diplomats said. Trump has expressed an openness to Iran maintaining a civilian nuclear program.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t made that decision yet,\u201d Trump said Wednesday when asked if the U.S. position is that Iran can have a uranium enrichment program for civilian nuclear purposes.",
      "\u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump,\u201d\u00a0James Hewitt, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement responding to this story. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East. As he has repeatedly stated in his first and second terms, the president is committed to ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "A third U.S. official said the president\u2019s team has communicated with Israeli officials regularly about the status of negotiations with Iran, providing updates and coordinating on elements of a potential deal.",
      "Netanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u2018Trump has his own agenda\u2019",
      "Netanyahu was\u00a0blindsided \u2014 and infuriated \u2014\u00a0this past week\u00a0by Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. was halting its military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen after the\u00a0Houthis\u00a0agreed to stop firing on U.S. ships in the Red Sea, according to\u00a0one of the U.S. officials and\u00a0the\u00a0two Middle East diplomats.",
      "The Houthis had just attacked Israel with a missile that hit close to Ben Gurion, Israel\u2019s main airport.",
      "When Netanyahu visited the White House last month, for the second time since Trump took office,\u00a0he hoped\u00a0the president\u00a0would pledge U.S. air support for a possible Israeli operation against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, according to the two Middle Eastern diplomats. The Israeli leader was taken aback when the president instead announced he would agree to direct talks with Tehran, the diplomats said.",
      "Netanyahu has privately said\u00a0he thinks\u00a0Trump\u2019s negotiations with Iran are a waste of time because Tehran will never hold up its end of any deal, according to the two U.S. officials. Israel has argued that Iran is so weakened by economic sanctions and the degradation of its proxies in the region that now is an ideal moment to take out its nuclear facilities, and it is concerned the window for doing so is closing while the U.S. negotiates, the officials said.",
      "Adding to that concern about timing,\u00a0Israeli military strikes\u00a0crippled Iranian strategic air defenses in October,\u00a0meaning manned aircraft conducting new strikes now\u00a0would not be as susceptible to being shot down. But the Iranians are rebuilding their air defenses.",
      "Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham said this week that the only acceptable Iran deal is one that completely stops Tehran from any uranium enrichment. They also urged Trump to submit any Iran nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification, which requires a two-thirds majority vote.",
      "Asked about Cotton and Graham\u2019s comments, a fourth U.S. official said Witkoff is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Graham about Iran negotiations and briefed Cotton on them this past week.",
      "The 2015 Iran nuclear deal reached by President Barack Obama was not ratified by the Senate, which allowed Trump to simply withdraw the U.S. from the agreement during his first term.",
      "\u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is the Israelis recognizing that as much as they welcomed the election of President Trump and thought that would really give them a blank check to pursue whatever agenda they wanted, Trump has his own agenda,\u201d Frank Lowenstein,\u00a0a former Middle East envoy under the Obama administration,\u00a0said during a virtual briefing organized by J Street, an advocacy organization that describes itself as pro-Israel and pro-peace.",
      "Although Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Iran and the U.S. deal with the Houthis are \u201canathema\u201d to Netanyahu, the prime minister does not have the political leverage in Washington or Israel to enter into a direct confrontation with Trump, who is popular with\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s\u00a0base in Israel, said Ilan Goldenberg, who worked on Middle East policy\u00a0as a senior official during\u00a0the Biden and Obama administrations.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cwhole political strategy and survival strategy is based on holding his coalition and holding his political base together,\u201d Goldenberg said in the briefing organized by J Street. \u201cAnd those folks love Trump, so for him to go very publicly against Trump is something he really can\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "The strain\u00a0in\u00a0the relationship between\u00a0Trump and\u00a0Netanyahu comes as the president is set\u00a0to\u00a0travel to the Middle East next week, with stops\u00a0scheduled\u00a0in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Trump\u00a0is not currently scheduled\u00a0to visit Israel\u00a0on this trip, though he did during his first term.",
      "Witkoff also\u00a0planned to\u00a0attend another round of negotiations with Iran this weekend in Oman."

      "The 22-year-old, who graduated this month with a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science and an economics minor, planned to apply to the Department of Education, but cuts to the department\u2019s workforce and the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to ditch anything related to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives prompted him to change course.",
      "Rosier, a first-generation college student, said President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promise to dismantle the Department of Education and his moves to put the plan in motion once he entered the White House left him feeling \u201cdiscouraged.\u201d",
      "Rosier is one of four Black students who spoke with NBC News about graduating into a job market that has seen DEI rollbacks, less outward enthusiasm for recruiting Black workers and signs of a cooldown in hiring for everyone. New college graduates\u2019 unemployment rate was 5.8% as of March, up from 4.6% a year earlier, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported last week.",
      "Walter Pearson, the CEO of College Bound Parenting, an organization that helps Black college students prepare for jobs, said most years he is able to help 90% of the small group of students he works with land their first job. This year, it\u2019s just 50%. Meanwhile, most of the students who spoke to NBC News said they are graduating without job offers and feel uncertain about a future in which they may be overlooked for jobs without specific guardrails in place.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t really be a part of something that I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m wanted in,\u201d Rosier said. \u201cSo I definitely want to be in a position in which I\u2019m wanted, not where I\u2019m tolerated.\u201d",

      "The student said he secured a summer internship, but is assessing job opportunities for afterward. While his internship\u2019s company has stated commitments to diversity and inclusion in the job listing, he said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if these sorts of explicit statements disappeared, followed by actual support for Black workers.",
      "Beyond post-college jobs, funding cuts have made potential research projects for new grads slim.",
      "Grey Snyder, 26, a senior at the University of Missouri at Columbia studying psychology, witnessed these impacts firsthand. Snyder, who uses they/them pronouns, said they tried to secure a lab position for their gap year, but was told that grant funding was so \u201cup in the air\u201d due to Trump\u2019s executive order on DEI that the position was not guaranteed.",
      "Across social media and among the students who spoke to NBC News, several said they had peers and friends who lost out on internships or research opportunities because of cuts like these.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really affecting psychological sciences specifically, though, and any research about minorities or underprivileged populations,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to study the people who need the most studying right now.\u201d",

      "Pearson, 22, said she had a conversation with a friend who said they would decline to answer certain questions on an application to avoid being characterized. She disagreed with the move.",

    "story": [
      "New research suggests wild chimpanzees have developed a far more nuanced communication system than previously realized, using several mechanisms that combine their vocalizations to create new meaning.",
      "These elements of chimpanzee communication, described in a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances, resemble some of the fundamental building blocks of human language.",
      "Scientists analyzed recordings of three groups of chimpanzees living in the Ivory Coast and found that chimps can combine their hoots, grunts and calls in a similar way to how humans use idioms or change the order of words to build new phrases.",
      "The new research is the first time scientists have documented such complexity in a nonhuman communication system, and they think that the chimpanzees\u2019 abilities represent an evolutionary transition point between rudimentary animal communication and human language.",
      "\u201cGenerating new or combined meanings by combining words is a hallmark of human language,\u201d Catherine Crockford, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology who co-directs the Tai Chimpanzee Project, said in a news release. \u201cIt is crucial to investigate whether a similar capacity exists in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos.\u201d",
      "A separate study, published last month, provided similar evidence that bonobos, another primate, can also combine their calls to modify calls and form phrases. Together, these studies suggest both species evolved to develop fundamental building blocks of human language.",
      "Bonobos and chimpanzees are the species most closely related to humans in evolutionary history, which means all three species could have evolved from a common ancestor with this ability, a theory that could help researchers understand how human language developed.",
      "\u201cOur findings suggest a highly generative vocal communication system, unprecedented in the animal kingdom, which echoes recent findings in bonobos suggesting that complex combinatorial capacities were already present in the common ancestor of humans and these two great ape species,\u201d C\u00e9dric Girard-Buttoz, a researcher with the ENES bioacoustics research lab and the first author of the study, said in a news release.",
      "The researchers discovered these new complexities in chimpanzees\u2019 vocal system by following particular animals in the field from dawn to dusk for about 12 hours each day, recording the sounds the chimpanzees made and the responses from others in the group.\u00a0They recorded more than 4,300 vocalizations from 53 wild chimpanzees.",
      "During the chimps\u2019 vocal calls, the researchers also tracked what  activities, social interactions and environmental changes were occurring, and noted if the animals\u00a0were eating, playing or encountering a predator, for example.",
      "Then, the researchers performed a statistical analysis of specific two-call combinations \u2014 such as a grunt followed by a bark \u2014 that were documented in multiple animals.",
      "The researchers found that chimpanzees combined calls in all of their daily aspects of life and that the combinations could express a wide variety of meanings.",
      "Simon Townsend, a professor at the University of Zurich who studies cognition in primates and contributed to the bonobo research but was not involved in this study, said the paper is the first to show chimpanzees using several different mechanisms that are considered to be among the building blocks of language.",
      "He said the evidence does suggest that the common evolutionary ancestor of bonobos, humans and chimpanzees probably had this ability, too.",
      "\u201cIt does seem to suggest that our linguistic abilities were already well on the way to evolving ... 6-7 million years ago,\u201d Townsend said, referring to when the species likely branched off from one another in the evolutionary tree.",
      "Not all primates show evidence of such complicated communication. Forest monkeys, which have relatively simple social groups, mostly use vocalizations to manage predatory threats, Townsend said.",
      "But he thinks the formation of increasingly large and complicated social groups \u2014 an element common to great ape species and humans \u2014 likely spurred the evolution of more complex communication and eventually the ability to form language.",
      "For bonobos and chimpanzees, \u201cthe biggest challenge for them is navigating their complex social world. They live in much larger groups. \u2026 There\u2019s aggression, there\u2019s reconciliation, there\u2019s territoriality, there\u2019s intergroup interactions, and vocalizations, I think, is one evolutionary solution to trying to manage these complex and fine-grained social interactions,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "In human language, syntax is the set of rules that creates a system capable of expressing an infinite number of meanings.",
      "\u201cSyntax is all about providing more and more precise, refined information. And you probably only need to do that when your social interactions get more complex,\u201d Townsend said."

      "Inside a 90-square-mile stretch of rural reservation between the eastern Jemez Mountains and the banks of the Rio Grande River sits the Santa Clara Pueblo Community Library, an anchor for the northern New Mexico tribe it serves.",
      "Internet service across the Santa Clara Pueblo reservation is sparse, the tribe\u2019s governor, James Naranjo, told NBC News, and resources to expand access to technology and literacy programs for its 1,700 members are already stretched thin.",
      "Naranjo said the library relies on federal grant money to build bridges between the tribe and otherwise out-of-reach services \u2014 grants that could be on the chopping block thanks to cuts by the Trump administration.",
      "The Pueblo\u2019s was one of more than a hundred libraries on federally recognized tribal lands across the country that were notified by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) \u2014 a small federal agency responsible for funding local libraries and museums across the country \u2014 that their congressionally appropriated grant had been terminated midcycle, according to an IMLS spokesperson.",
      "\u201cIMLS has determined that your grant is unfortunately no longer consistent with the agency\u2019s priorities and no longer serves the interest of the United States and the IMLS Program,\u201d one letter, obtained by NBC News from a tribal grant writer who received it, said. \u201cIMLS is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "The letter was signed by Deputy Labor Secretary Keith Sonderling, whom President Donald Trump appointed as acting director of the IMLS in March. Days before Sonderling\u2019s appointment, Trump signed an executive order directing the agency, and six others, to be eliminated to the \u201cmaximum extent consistent with applicable law.\u201d Only Congress holds the legal authority to shut down the agency.",
      "Trump\u2019s March 14 order instructed the IMLS \u2014 which guarantees states and sovereign tribes can provide the public with free access to myriad services like early literacy resources, Braille books, internet access and STEM and cultural programs \u2014 to cease all operations, slash staff and provide a report to the Office of Management and Budget detailing proof of compliance.",
      "Within days, the Department of Government Efficiency descended upon the 75-person IMLS staff. All but a dozen were placed on administrative leave. Then, in early April, Sonderling terminated all IMLS grants except for those missed by human error, an IMLS spokesperson told NBC News.",
      "The spokesperson said the grants were terminated for evaluation purposes, and that some of them would be reinstated if they align with the administration\u2019s priorities, but declined to provide details on the timeline and criteria.",
      "The sweeping grant cancellations were part of a broader effort by Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to drastically reduce the scope of federal spending by freezing funds and ordering mass layoffs across a number of agencies, including the Department of Education, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "The American Library Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the largest union representing library employees, sued Sonderling, Trump and DOGE to stop the dismantling of the IMLS last month.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon granted a temporary restraining order last week that bars the Trump administration from making further cuts to IMLS staff and grants.",
      "An injunction granted Tuesday in a separate lawsuit brought by 21 state attorneys general against the Trump administration cemented that the IMLS cannot be downsized any further, but as litigation continues ahead of a final ruling, the future of the grants is still up in the air. And in his 2026 budget outline, Trump proposed defunding the IMLS entirely.",
      "Tribal leaders worry that it could mean the end of library services their constituents rely on, and the beginning of a very long fight.",
      "\u201cThis is something that\u2019s personal to me,\u201d said American Library Association President Cindy Hohl, a member of the Santee Sioux Nation of South Dakota, which said it had its Native American Basic Grant canceled.",
      "\u201cAs we continue to look at what is happening in the current government, we need to advocate for the needs of our sovereign nations,\u201d Hohl said. \u201cWe need to hold the federal government accountable to upholding their trust responsibility.\u201d",
      "\u201cTribal libraries and tribal communities have specific needs to preserve their culture, their language, their heritage, and to live as traditional people in our traditional communities,\u201d Hohl added.",
      "Among the initial cuts were four grant programs designed specifically to support library and museum services in rural Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian communities.",
      "Thousands of miles from New Mexico, the only library within miles of the 68-person Igiugig Village tribe in southwestern Alaska was stripped of the funding it relies on to purchase books and sustain its summer reading program. In Juneau, funding for a project dedicated to digitizing and preserving the history of Native Alaska was slashed. Across Indian Country, the federal dollars that funded tribal librarian and coordinator salaries have run dry, putting the jobs and the programs they run in jeopardy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that these cuts are nationwide, and it\u2019s hurting our children,\u201d Naranjo said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s hurting our unborn. It\u2019s hurting our community in general. Yeah, $10,000 might be a small amount to others, but it\u2019s a huge amount to us.\u201d",
      "The Santa Clara Pueblo received $10,000 last year through the Native American Library Services Basic Grants program, which is designed to provide small, hard-to-reach Native American and Indigenous communities with access to funding that addresses the individual needs of each tribe. In the absence of the grants they were promised, Naranjo and tribal leaders across the country may have to make difficult decisions to keep their local libraries and museums afloat.",
      "\u201cOur library is our vault,\u201d said Santa Clara Pueblo Lt. Gov. Charles Suazo, who previously served as library coordinator, a position made possible by the IMLS grant money and which is now at risk unless the tribe dips into other areas of its budget to sustain the salary. \u201cIt holds our traditional language, some old pictures, some relics from the past. \u2026 Without this, all that could be lost.\u201d",
      "The Santa Clara Pueblo and the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo near Santa Fe, New Mexico, share the traditional Tewa language, which is considered endangered by Native language experts. An IMLS-funded project at the P\u2019oe Tsawa Community Library in Ohkay Owingeh teaches Tewa to tribal youth in an effort to preserve it, but it could be on the chopping block if the grant money isn\u2019t fully restored.",
      "\u201cThese are really critical services,\u201d Ohkay Owingeh Lt. Gov. Matthew Martinez said. \u201cI mean, our library, physically, is at the center of our tribal community in rural northern New Mexico.\u201d",
      "The IMLS, created in 1996 and which Trump himself reauthorized in 2018, last year announced $5.9 million in grants across 173 total grants awarded to Native American and Indigenous tribes, according to a statement from the agency. Congress appropriated $294.8 million to the agency in 2024.",
      "Whether the president has the authority to stop the flow of the federal dollars Congress appropriated, and the IMLS already awarded, is at the center of the appeals some tribal leaders and grant managers are making to Sonderling in hopes of a lifeline for their community service projects.",
      "The Makah Tribe in Neah Bay, Washington, is home to the Makah Cultural and Research Center, which could be left on the hook for large portions of the $149,779 Native American Library Enhancement Grant it was awarded. The grant funds hadn\u2019t been reimbursed in full by the IMLS when the grant was terminated halfway through its life cycle last month, according to Janine Ledford, the executive director of the Makah Cultural and Research Center.",
      "\u201cThis project has been empowering individuals on their journey toward wellness in response to an alarming opioid epidemic on the Makah Reservation,\u201d Ledford wrote in an appeal letter sent to Sonderling on May 7 and shared with NBC News. \u201cThe MCRC has been open since 1979 and has never had any federal awards offered, accepted and then revoked.\u201d",
      "Tribal leaders said the sprawling violation of contracts between the federal government and sovereign tribal nations opens up centuries-old wounds.",
      "\u201cIf you look at history, the federal government, you know, put our parents and grandparents in boarding schools. Language was not taught,\u201d said Martinez, the Ohkay Owingeh lieutenant governor. \u201cWe were punished for speaking [our] language, so we\u2019ve built momentum to privilege the use of language and incorporate it in everything that we do.\u201d"

    "summary": "For many Peruvians, Leo is more than the first pope from the U.S., he is also the first Peruvian pope.",
    "story": [
      "CHICLAYO, Peru \u2014 Walkiria Garcia was 14 years old when she made her confirmation in the Catholic Church, an already significant religious sacrament made even more unforgettable by the man officiating it, Robert Prevost, who a decade later would become Pope Leo XIV.",
      "To many Peruvians, however, Leo is more than the first pope from the U.S. He is also the first Peruvian pope.",
      "Pope Leo, born on the South Side of Chicago, first arrived in Peru in 1985 as a missionary. For 10 years, he taught canon law in Trujillo, immersing himself in the local culture and community.",
      "Though he returned to Chicago to lead the Augustinian order in the Midwest, he couldn\u2019t stay away for too long. In 2014, he moved to Chiclayo, Peru, where he served as an apostolic administrator, bishop and later archbishop. He even became a naturalized Peruvian citizen in 2015.",
      "Now, Garcia has one message for the new pontiff: \u201cDon\u2019t change.\u201d",
      "Garcia, now 24, recalls her first encounter with Leo at her Augustinian school, saying she felt like he was more of a friend than an authority figure.",
      "That\u2019s because Leo was \u201cfun,\u201d and was frequently seen playing games with the students in addition to speaking to them about religious topics.",
      "Garcia said the former bishop shared messages of love and openness with the students, in line with their Augustinian beliefs.",
      "\u201cWe can always return and we can always change our life,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "Leo\u2019s deep bond with Peruvians is rooted in his embrace of their customs. Garcia fondly remembers seeing him at cultural festivals, serving food and participating in traditions. \u201cHe was Peruvian,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "In his first speech as pope, Leo expressed gratitude to the people of Chiclayo, highlighting the city\u2019s influence on his journey.",
      "Garcia connected with Leo again in a chance encounter during a 2021 flight, where they reminisced about her confirmation and school days.",
      "Garcia hopes that Leo will \u201cfollow the Francis message,\u201d continuing to \u201clove all people\u201d and embracing members of the LGBTQ community. She would like to see him continue his work with children and young adults, just as he did in Chiclayo.",
      "\u201cHe is our first Peruvian pope,\u201d Garcia said.",

The fine was then doubled \u201cpursuant to an escalating penalty structure for repeat riding crop violations within the previous 180 days,\u201d resulting in a $62,000 fine, according to HISA.",

      "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 New Orleans Saints veteran starting quarterback Derek Carr has decided to retire because of a labral tear in his right shoulder and \u201csignificant degenerative changes\u201d to his rotator cuff, the team announced Saturday.",
      "Carr, 34, has played for 11 pro seasons since being selected out of Fresno State by the then-Oakland Raiders in the second round of the 2014 NFL draft.",
      "He was acquired by the Saints as a free agent in 2023 but had mixed results in New Orleans, going 14-13 as a starter while struggling through oblique, hand and head injuries that caused him to miss seven games last season.",
      "Carr, who was entering the third year of a four-year, $150 million contract, experienced unexpected pain in his throwing shoulder when he began to ramp up training this offseason, which led to his diagnosis that now has cut short his career.",
      "\u201cSurgery was an option, jeopardizing the entire 2025 season, yet there was no guarantee Derek would return to the level of strength, function and performance of play to which he was accustomed,\u201d the Saints said in a written announcement.",
      "The Saints did not acknowledge Carr\u2019s injury until the day before the draft. Carr did not speak publicly about the injury until a few days later, when he\u00a0delivered a guest sermon at a Las Vegas church. In that sermon, Carr said his critics were \u201clying\u201d about him when they questioned the unusual timing of the injury, as well as both the team\u2019s and Carr\u2019s initial reticence to address it openly or answer questions about it.",
      "Carr has career passing totals of 41,245 yards, 257 touchdowns and 112 interceptions. He retires with a 77-92 regular-season record as a starter and without having won a playoff game.",
      "Carr said he made the decision in consultation with his wife, Heather, and \u201cupon reflection of prayer.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor more than 11 years, we have been incredibly blessed, and we are forever grateful and humbled by this experience,\u201d Carr said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to find the right words to express our thanks to all the teammates, coaches, management, ownership, team officials and especially the fans who made this journey so special.\u201d",
      "The decision also comes after New Orleans used a high\u00a0second-round draft choice to select Louisville\u2019s Tyler Shough\u00a0as a potential future starting quarterback \u2014 although it remains to be seen how quickly he can be ready for that role.",
      "Other QBs on the Saints\u2019 roster include second-year pro Spencer Rattler and third-year player Jake Haener, who did post a victory between them in seven games last season, six of which Rattler started."

      "Larry Eugene Parks, 30, was found dead along Interstate 5 on the morning of July 18, 1980, in Oregon, according to the Oregon State Police. An investigation into his death was opened, but Parks remained a John Doe until just last month, after an investigator from the sheriff\u2019s department in Orange County, California, offered to help identify him using forensic genealogy in 2024.",
      "Kraft, who remains incarcerated at San Quentin Rehabilitation Center, was convicted of brutalizing and killing 16 men during a decadelong series of slayings in Orange County, California, that ended with his arrest. The convicted murderer is also suspected of committing over 60 murders across the West Coast and Michigan, police said.",
      "To identify Parks as another potential victim, a genetic profile was created using a sample of his blood, which helped investigators find and contact possible family members. They submitted DNA, leading to his identification. Parks was a Vietnam veteran and had lost contact with his family a year before his death.",
      "\u201cUntil his identification last month, the circumstances of his disappearance were unknown to the Parks family,\u201d police said.",
      "Police believe Kraft, who was arrested in Orange County, California, in 1983, is responsible for Parks\u2019 death. Evidence from the murder, along with the murder of another man who was also found on I-5 the day before Parks, was transferred to the Orange County District Attorney\u2019s Office to be used in court, but remained in the county until 2024, when the investigator set out to identify the 30-year-old, according to police.",

    "published": "Sat, 10 May 2025 14:52:14 GMT",
    "summary": "The Knicks are up 2-0 in the series despite being down 20 points in each of those games. Can they keep it up?",
    "story": [
      "The most surprising series of the second round of the NBA playoffs so far is the one between the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks.",
      "After the Celtics won the four games between the two teams in the regular season \u2014 with an average margin of victory of 16.3 points \u2014 the Knicks have raced out to a 2-0 lead in their postseason matchup. Not only did New York win two games on the road to start the series, the Knicks came back from 20-point deficits in the second halves of both games.",
      "How is all this happening? NBC News\u2019 Andrew Greif and Rohan Nadkarni break down the series so far, and what to expect moving forward.",
      "Did the Knicks win the first two games or did the Celtics blow it?",
      "Nadkarni: The real answer is it is a combination of both. At the same time, if we\u2019re splitting up the accountability pie, the Celtics deserve more scorn for blowing the first two games.",
      "Simply put, Boston has made only 25 of its 100 3-point attempts this series. If the Celtics were shooting only 30% \u2014 which would still be far below their regular-season average and by far the worst of any team in the NBA \u2014 they are probably up 2-0 in this series. I don\u2019t want to get too reductive and say \u201cmake shots\u201d... but also, make some shots!",
      "Greif: This is Boston\u2019s undoing, because while the Knicks have played with an undeniable resolve all postseason \u2014 multiple comebacks secured their first-round victory against Detroit, too \u2014 they\u2019ve also been undeniably flawed.",
      "Game 2 was New York\u2019s worst offensive game of its season, as measured by points scored per possession, and it wasn\u2019t exactly a shock for a team that is scoring 10 fewer points per 100 possessions in the playoffs than during the regular season. That\u2019s a big drop, even when accounting for the seemingly annual trend of scoring dropping in the playoffs. Yet the Knicks have handed Boston two losses in a series for the first time since 2023, anyway.",
      "Who is most to blame for the Celtics being down 2-0?",
      "Greif: Shoddy late-game execution that is shouldered by everyone. Boston has given up 11 more field goals, made just 15 percent of its 3-pointers, and registered a meager 6-to-5 assist-to-turnover ratio in the fourth quarter.",
      "With 18 seconds left in Game 2, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla designed a smart play to free star Jayson Tatum for a full sprint that turned into an easy dunk and 90-89 lead. But needing another go-ahead basket on the game\u2019s final possession, Mazzulla went to the exact same play and the Knicks weren\u2019t fooled. Tatum is shooting just 1-for-12 in the fourth quarter this series, while his co-star Jaylen Brown is 1-for-7.",
      "Nadkarni: The buck has to stop with Boston\u2019s best players, Tatum and Brown. Tatum is shooting under 30% from the field this series, and Brown isn\u2019t doing much better, shooting under 40%. They have been inefficient, too 3-point happy, and aren\u2019t making good decisions in crunch time.",
      "Tatum especially needs to step up. Not because he\u2019s not great, not because he has to prove he\u2019s a superstar, but because he\u2019s shown all these things already. Tatum is an incredibly accomplished playoff performer, and he\u2019s had some big games in incredibly high-stakes moments. You wouldn\u2019t know that from watching this series.",
      "Can the Knicks keep this up?",
      "Nadkarni: Almost definitely not, but they also don\u2019t have to. There\u2019s no rule that you have to win every game in a four-game series the same way. Even if the Celtics start hitting 3s, that doesn\u2019t mean the Knicks can\u2019t win this series.",
      "I don\u2019t expect New York to keep winning in the fashion it did in the first two games. It would be irresponsible to assume any team can keep creating 20-point deficits in the playoffs and come back to win every time. So I don\u2019t believe the Knicks\u2019 formula from the first two games is repeatable (even though they somehow repeated it after Game 1!), but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have other ways to win.",
      "Greif: This is fundamentally a question of what you trust more. Is it a two-game sample size that has seen the Knicks turn into a crunch-time monster \u2014 in fourth quarters this series, New York has made nine 3-pointers while Boston has made nine shots total \u2014 or their season-long body of evidence, which saw New York rank only around league average in \u201cclutch\u201d scenarios?",
      "And do you view the Knicks, who are now 6-2 in the postseason against the 44-38 Pistons and 61-21 Celtics, as finally equipped to beat good teams, or the squad that went just 15-23 against teams with winning records during the regular season? They\u2019ve captured lighting in a bottle and yet it still feels like the Celtics have a larger margin for error.",

      "The Cavaliers need Darius Garland to overcome adversity one more time",
      "2028 Los Angeles Olympics Opening and Closing Ceremony locations revealed",
      "What is the Celtics\u2019 path to winning the series?",
      "Greif: Regression to the mean. Boston\u2019s strategy of shooting many, many 3-pointers is nothing new, but rarely have they been this bad at it. When Celtics radio broadcaster Sean Grande dug into the numbers, he found that Games 1 and 2 marked just the second time in the last six years that the team had gone consecutive games shooting 25% or worse from 3. Will that level of shooting really sustain an entire series?",
      "The other trend worth watching is that Boston has a .709 winning percentage on the road versus .589 at home during their last four postseasons. Playing in New York this weekend, then, might actually be a good thing.",
      "Nadkarni: The Celtics\u2019 path is to do what they\u2019ve done for most of this series and pretty much all of the regular season: Overwhelm teams with their shooting talent while being stout at every position defensively. What the fourth-quarter comebacks obfuscate is that Boston has to build a 20-point lead in the first place! The Celtics have been able to dominate large portions of this series despite not shooting well at all.",
      "Boston does not need to reinvent the wheel. It doesn\u2019t even need to radically change its strategy, even if its frustrating watching 3s not fall after possessions with very minimal passing. But the Celtics are literally a couple shots a way from winning a series in which they\u2019ve lost by four points combined over two games. The Cs need to stick to who they\u2019ve been.",
      "Biggest X factor in the series?",
      "Nadkarni: Outside of the 3-point shooting, it\u2019s what happening in the frontcourt. Knicks center Mitchell Robinson has been a huge plus this series, to the point Boston was desperately trying to intentionally foul him off the court in Game 2.",
      "Meanwhile, Celtics\u2019 center Kristaps Porzingis is dealing with a mysterious illness, and it\u2019s made Boston much more reliant on Al Horford than it wants to be. Horford has been a steady pro for years, but he is not the offensive threat Porzingis is. Even if the center battle may not ultimately determine what happens in this series, it\u2019s an important subplot under what\u2019s transpired so far.",
      "Greif: The eye test and the numbers suggest it\u2019s Knicks big man Robinson. The Knicks have a 2-0 lead because of their defense, and when Robinson has been on the floor this series New York\u2019s defense is 16 points better than when he sits.",
      "But the Celtics' Porzingis, who has played only 27 minutes because of a respiratory illness through two games, is my pick. He was a floor-raising catalyst during last year\u2019s Celtics NBA championship but has been a shell of himself in this series, with nearly as many turnovers (two) as field goals (three). Porzingis tried to express confidence while saying that going down 0-2 \u201ckind of takes all the pressure off of us,\u201d but history doesn\u2019t bear that out. Of the 463 playoff series in NBA history to start 2-0, only 34 trailing teams have eventually come back to win."

      "On various mainstream and alternative tech platforms this week, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has been able to share his latest song, titled \u201cHeil Hitler,\u201d along with its companion title, \u201cWW3,\u201d which similarly glorifies Hitler, the architect of the Holocaust.",
      "While some platforms have taken steps to attempt to pull down the song, others have seemingly let it spread freely.",
      "The continued spread of the song and the varying approaches to moderation exemplify an increasingly fractured environment online and on social media, where some platforms have pulled back on their moderation practices in recent years, while others have tried to maintain higher standards when it comes to hate speech.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s X is where the song has found its biggest audience.",
      "On Thursday, Ye uploaded a video for the song on X, where it remained up as of Friday evening and received more than 6.5 million views. At least 12,000 users and a handful of right-wing influencers quickly shared the clip on their pages. Ye\u2019s most recent repost is of a video mixing historical clips of Hitler together with his song as a backing track. He also shared a video on X of influencer Andrew Tate \u2014 a self-described misogynist \u2014 playing the song in his car. That video has been viewed over 3 million times.",
      "Ye\u2019s account is verified as an organization on X, meaning it could be eligible for monetization and ads. It\u2019s not clear if Ye\u2019s account uses those features.",
      "The proliferation of the song, despite its invocation of Hitler, is the latest illustration of the power that social media platforms have handed over to some highly followed celebrities and influencers, and their inability or unwillingness to control the spread of some content after it\u2019s been published. While Ye did not appear to attempt to upload the song to other social media platforms, other people have reposted the video.",
      "On Reddit, users on several subreddits devoted to Ye and other rappers uploaded versions of the song to the platform. On r/Kanye, which has 1.1 million members, some users bemoaned Ye\u2019s continued invocation of Hitler and Nazis, while others celebrated the song, posting memes and TikTok videos about it.",

We have strict rules against hateful content, including antisemitic content. Our internal safety teams proactively enforce these policies across the platform through automated tooling and human review. In line with our sitewide rules, we are removing the song and any celebration of its message.\"",
      "On Facebook, NBC News found over a dozen reuploads of the \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d music video, and on YouTube half a dozen reuploads of the song that had been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. On TikTok, a handful of reuploads had been posted using the hashtag #hh.",

      "Ye was briefly able to upload the song to the popular music streaming services Spotify and SoundCloud.",

      "In the final two episodes of \u201cSt. Denis Medical\u2019s\u201d premiere season, Ron and Joyce\u2019s differences were on full display. In Episode 17, the two turned a fundraiser hospital gala into a verbal sparring session, with Joyce eventually seizing the mic to hijack Ron\u2019s hosting gig and make it a roast.",
      "Then in Episode 18, Ron seemingly hits his limit after the overly ambitious Joyce promises away all of the hospital's newly acquired funds. But in the last few moments of the season finale, which aired on NBC April 29, Joyce and Ron have a rare moment of understanding.",

      "When Keisha (Lovie Simone) earns a full ride to Howard University and Justin (Michael Cooper Jr.) is accepted to Northwestern, their picture-perfect \u201cforever\u201d begins to fade. The pair, bonded by an intense emotional connection and teenage promises, must confront a truth: love alone isn\u2019t always enough to anchor two people amid dreams, expectations and self-discovery.",
      "By Episode 8, the cracks are no longer subtle. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to fight for us, then fight for Justin,\u201d Keisha pleads. It\u2019s a turning point. She urges him to stop orbiting their relationship and start choosing himself. Justin listens \u2014 and walks away. Their parting is soft, tearful and filled with affection. But it\u2019s still an ending.",
      "\"Forever,\" adapted from Judy Blume\u2019s 1975 novel by creator Mara Brock Akil, updates the original\u2019s emotional weight for today\u2019s youth. It doesn\u2019t aim to sell a fantasy.",
      "In interviews with TODAY.com, both Simone and Cooper said the material felt personal.",
      "\u201cI needed to be Keisha,\u201d Simone says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a well-written book. I loved how much heart she had, even when she was hiding so much.\u201d",
      "\u201cJudy was ahead of her time. And Mara\u2019s adaptation is so current and beautiful. Justin\u2019s journey, trying to figure out what\u2019s right for him, is something I really connected to,\u201d Cooper says.",

      "In Episode 7, Keisha\u2019s father warns her that Justin is still lost, not out of judgment, but recognition. He, too, once wandered without direction. Justin\u2019s internal struggle, college versus music, becomes a metaphor for the fork in the road every young adult faces.",
      "By the final episode, Keisha and Justin take a break. Then they reunite, reaffirm their love and break up again, this time for good. Not in anger. Not in bitterness. But out of necessity.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t leave because he stops loving her,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cHe leaves because he needs to know who he is. And that\u2019s what hurts the most.\u201d",

      "\u201cAnything that goes and takes away from you,\u201d Keisha\u2019s mother tells her, \u201che will replace it with the same or better.\u201d It reframes their breakup not as a loss, but as a necessary chapter.",
      "Despite its title, \"Forever\" doesn\u2019t glorify permanence. Instead, it frames love as a rite of passage \u2014 something that shapes us, challenges us and sometimes leaves us.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re that age, everything feels intense,\u201d Simone says. \u201cEvery choice feels like the most important decision of your life.\u201d",

      "That\u2019s why the ending lingers \u2014 not because it\u2019s sad, but because it\u2019s honest. \"Forever\" doesn\u2019t claim love always lasts. It shows how even the right love, if it ends, can leave you better than it found you."

      "Martens and her dad, Tom Martens, were charged and convicted of second-degree murder, a conviction later downgraded to voluntary manslaughter, after Corbett was found with severe head trauma at the couple\u2019s home in Davidson County, North Carolina.",
      "Molly Martens has said that the killing was an act of self-defense, and that Corbett was emotionally and physically abusive during their marriage.",
      "Meanwhile, Corbett\u2019s relatives have disputed this and have alleged that Corbett\u2019s killing was an act of calculated murder on the part of Martens and her father.",
      "The Netflix documentary explores the case from both perspectives, including sharing the viewpoints of Corbett\u2019s now-grown children, Jack and Sarah Corbett, who have defended their father against Martens\u2019 claims.",
      "Molly Martens, now released from prison, was also interviewed extensively for the documentary, and she shared where her relationship stands now with her former stepchildren. Her stepchildren also spoke out in the documentary with daughter Sarah saying her father was a \u201cvictim.\u201d",

      "Who is Molly Martens?",
      "Molly Martens is the second wife of Jason Corbett.",
      "Corbett hired Martens as an au pair after his first wife, Margaret, died of an asthma attack in the early 2000s. After \u201cseveral weeks\u201d living together, they began a romantic relationship, according to a 2020 document from the Court of Appeals of North Carolina concluding that the Martens warranted a retrial.",
      "In 2011, they moved from Ireland, where Corbett and his first wife were from, to Davidson County, South Carolina, near Molly Marten's home state of Tennessee, then married.",
      "Why did Molly Martens go to prison?",

      "Molly and Tom Martens have never denied that their actions that night led to Corbett\u2019s death, but they have both argued that they were carried out in self-defense, and defense of each other.",
      "In 2021, the father and daughter were granted a retrial after they appealed the court\u2019s original ruling, arguing that statements from Corbett\u2019s children should have been considered in the original trial.",
      "The trial court found that Jcak and Sarah\u2019s testimonies \u201cwere not made at a time when (they) were motivated to speak the truth but were rather motivated to affect future custody arrangements,\u201d per the 2020 document from the Court of Appeals.",
      "Jack and Sarah said during a medical evaluation at a children\u2019s advocacy center in Mocksville, North Carolina they had witnessed their father get angry at Molly Martens. Jack specifically said his father had \u201cpunched, hit, and pushed\u201d her, and that Corbett\u2019s anger problems had \u201cgotten worse.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe children appear to have known that if they were not in the custody of defendant Molly Corbett they would be taken to live in the Republic of Ireland with relatives of their father,\u201d the Court of Appeals document cites the trial court as stating.",
      "Both Jack and Sarah later recanted their statements, both saying that Molly Martens had coached them on what to say during their interviews. Jack said during a 2017 Skype call with a Davidson County district attorney that Molly Martens had made up stories about Corbett being abusive \u201cstarted saying if you don\u2019t lie (she would) never see (us) again.\u201d",
      "Both defendants struck plea deals before a retrial could take place. Molly Martens pleaded no contest to a downgraded charge of second-degree manslaughter, while her father pleaded guilty to the same charge.",
      "Both Tom and Molly Martens received credit for time already served, and were both released from prison on June 6, 2024.",
      "Where is Molly Martens now?",
      "Molly Martens was released from prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, on June 6, 2024, according to her inmate record from the North Carolina Correctional Institute for Women.",

      "Under the terms of their post-release supervision, the father and daughter have not been allowed to live together, but may visit each other, Deen told The Times. He also said they are both allowed to travel around the United States but must notify authorities of their movements.",
      "According to an email from Deen to TODAY.com, Molly and Thomas Martens will complete their post-release supervision on June 6, 2025.",
      "Martens\u2019 brother, Connor Martens, shared an update about how his sister and dad are doing in a May 7 interview with NBC affiliate WBIR Channel 10 in Knoxville, Tennessee.",

      "A new Netflix documentary, \u201cA Deadly American Marriage,\u201d takes a fresh look at the 2015 murder case that inspired widespread speculation and media coverage, both in the U.S. and in Corbett\u2019s home country of Ireland.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the real case behind \u201cA Deadly American Marriage,\u201d including the charges Martens and her father faced, and the very different narratives each family has shared about the circumstances of Corbett\u2019s death.",
      "What happened between Jason Corbett and Molly Martens?",
      "Jason Corbett, who was Irish, lived with his first wife, Margaret \u201cMags\u201d Fitzpatrick, in Ireland, and they had two children, Jack and Sarah.",
      "After Fitzpatrick\u00a0died unexpectedly of an asthma attack in the early 2000s, Corbett hired Molly Martens to work as an au pair. Romance bloomed between them and in 2011, they married and moved with Jack and Sarah to Davidson County, North Carolina.",
      "In 2015, a fateful altercation occurred between Corbett, Martens, and Martens\u2019 father, Tom Martens, a retired FBI agent.",
      "Tom Martens and his wife, Sharon, were staying with their daughter and husband at their home in Davidson County, visiting from Tennessee. One night in August 2015, Tom Martens said he heard a commotion coming from the couple\u2019s bedroom, including \u201ca scream and loud voices,\u201d according to his court testimony, included in a 2020 document from the Court of Appeals of North Carolina.",
      "Tom Martens said he went to the couple\u2019s room with an aluminum baseball bat and discovered Corbett with his hands around Molly Martens\u2019 neck. Corbett then reportedly moved his wife into a chokehold using his right arm, according to Tom Martens\u2019 testimony per the Court of Appeals document.",
      "A fight ensued, and Tom Martens hit Corbett on the head with the bat, attempting to free his daughter. As the two men struggled for control of the bat, Molly Martens grabbed a paving brick from her nightstand and used it to hit her husband, according to Molly Martens\u2019s testimony included in the Court of Appeals document.",
      "Tom Martens regained control of the bat and continued to strike Corbett \u201cuntil he was down, and he felt certain that Jason \u2018could not kill them,\u2019\u201d according to his testimony.",
      "Tom Martens then called 911 and told the dispatcher that Corbett was \u201cin bad shape\u201d and \u201cbleeding all over\u201d and said, \u201cI may have killed him.\u201d",
      "Sergeant Barry Alphin, a paramedic, testified he found Corbett had experienced \u201csevere heavy trauma to the back of the head.\u201d",
      "An autopsy two days later determined Corbett\u2019s cause of death to be blunt force head trauma, including \u201cextensive skull fractures,\u201d according to the Court of Appeals document.",
      "Deputy David Dillard from the Davidson County Sheriff\u2019s Office wrote in a report that Molly Martens was \u201cvery obviously in shock\u201d from the incident, according to the court document.",
      "He also wrote that Molly\u00a0Martens\u00a0\u201cwas making crying noises but (he) didn\u2019t see any visible tears. She was also rubbing her neck \u2026 It wasn\u2019t a constant. She would do it and stop to do it and then stop while continuing to make the crying noises.\u201d",
      "Deputies also retrieved the children, who had been sleeping undisturbed throughout the incident, according to the court document.",
      "A few days later, Jack and Sarah were separately interviewed and evaluated at a children\u2019s advocacy center in Mocksville, North Carolina.",
      "Both children said their father often got angry at Molly\u00a0Martens\u00a0for small things, and Jack said he had personally witnessed times his father \u201cpunched, hit, and pushed\u201d Molly\u00a0Martens, according to the Court of Appeals document.",
      "The children\u2019s statements were not admitted as evidence in the subsequent trial, partly because \u201cthe court (was) not assured of the children\u2019s motivation to speak the truth,\u201d according to the appeals document.",
      "Questions arose over whether the children had been coached by Molly Martens to give certain answers, so that the children would be allowed to continue living with Martens in the United States.",
      "\u201cThe children appear to have known that if they were not in the custody of defendant Molly Corbett they would be taken to live in the Republic of Ireland with relatives of their father,\u201d the Court of Appeals document cites the trial court as stating.",
      "Both children later specifically recanted their initial statements, including in a recorded interview Jack conducted from Ireland with members of the District Attorney\u2019s Office in North Carolina.",
      "Following the incident, the children returned to Ireland to live with their aunt and uncle. Both Jack and Sarah Corbett continue to deny allegations that their father was ever abusive, and they now accuse their step-mother of manipulating them and lying about Corbett\u2019s killing, according to the documentary.",
      "Today, Jack and Sarah Corbett do not have a relationship with Molly Martens and they expressed their anger at her in the documentary.",
      "What crimes were Molly Martens and her dad charged with?",
      "In\u00a0December 2015, Molly Martens and her father, Tom Martens, were indicted by a grand jury for second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. They both pleaded not guilty to the charges, according to a 2020 document from the Court of Appeals of North Carolina.",
      "In August 2017, the defendants were found guilty\u00a0of second-degree murder, and both were sentenced to 20 to 25 years in prison under the custody of the North Carolina Division of Adult Correction.",
      "Molly and Tom Martens appealed the court\u2019s ruling, arguing that certain statements made by Corbett\u2019s children, Jack and Sarah, should have been included as evidence in the original trial, according to the 2020 appeals document.",
      "In 2021, both defendants were granted\u00a0a retrial. However, they both struck plea deals before the new trial began.",
      "Molly Martens pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter, meaning she accepted the charge but did not admit guilt. Her father, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.",
      "In a 2023 document, the Davidson County Superior Court Division outlined certain mitigating factors that led to the reduced voluntary manslaughter charge for Molly Martens.",
      "The document stated that the \u201cdefendant acted under strong provocation,\u201d and committed her offense under \u201cduress,\u201d \u201ccoercion,\u201d \u201cthreat\u201d and \u201ccompulsion.\u201d",
      "These factors were not enough to justify a defense claim, but they \u201csignificantly reduced the defendant\u2019s culpability,\u201d the court found, according to the 2023 document.",
      "After Molly and Tom Martens pleaded to the reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter, they were sentenced to between 51 and 74 months, or between just over four to six years, in prison.",
      "They were given credit for the more than three-and-a-half years they had already served, meaning they would serve just an additional seven months behind bars.",
      "The father and daughter were both released from prison in June 2024.",
      "What have family members said about the case?Molly Martens\u2019 family and the Corbett family have shared very different narratives about the case, and about the nature of their relationship.",
      "Molly Martens has maintained that her late husband was emotionally and physically abusive, and that her acts on the night of Corbett's death were committed in self-defense.",
      "\u201cSometimes he would just be kind of seething and angry because I hadn\u2019t abided by something, or I\u2019d been somewhere I shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d she alleged in the documentary. \u201cAnd sometimes that would lead to a violent situation.\u201d",
      "She also accused Corbett of coercively controlling her by not allowing her to formally adopt Jack and Sarah. She alleged that by preventing her from adopting them, Corbett ensured she would never divorce him, because she knew she would lose access to the children if she left him.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been weaponized against me, and they wanted to hurt me, and they did,\u201d she said in the documentary.",
      "Tom Martens has also stood by his actions on the night of Corbett\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if a father can see something worse than watching his child die in front of him. I was going to save her life or die trying,\u201d he said in the documentary. \u201cAnd I have no regrets.\u201d",
      "He said in the documentary that he believes his daughter was abused by Corbett.",
      "\u201cMolly was becoming a shell of what she had been. She was definitely not as happy,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was definitely not as confident. She was acting beaten down. I did not realize the extent or seriousness of the domestic abuse, but I do now.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Corbett\u2019s relatives allege that Molly Martens did not kill Corbett in self-defense, and deny accusations that Corbett was abusive.",
      "Corbett\u2019s sister, Tracey Corbett-Lynch, who took care of Jack and Sarah following her brother\u2019s death, said in the documentary she wants \u201cthe world to know the truth about Jason.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was very charismatic \u2026 family meant everything to him,\u201d she said in the documentary.",
      "In February, Corbett\u2019s daughter, Sarah Corbett Lynch, now 18, released a memoir about her late dad, \u201cA Time for Truth: My Father Jason and My Search for Justice and Healing.\u201d",
      "In a March interview with Ireland\u2019s Newstalk FM, she alleged that Molly Martens had coached her and her brother to tell authorities they had witnessed domestic abuse at home.",
      "\u201cWe loved Molly and we trusted her, and we were told that if we didn\u2019t lie that we would never see each other again and that we would be taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had been coached for years. Yes, the Martens sat us down before we went into those interviews and told us that we needed to say certain things.\u201d",
      "She has also shared her belief in the documentary that her dad was \u201cthe victim\u201d in the case, and expressed her anger over the Martens\u2019 reduced sentence and release from prison.",
      "\u201cThis is not what my dad deserves, it\u2019s not what I deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not fair.\u201d",
      "Jack, now 20, also shared his belief in the documentary that his father\u2019s death was a calculated murder, not an act of self defense. He said that now, he has \u201cno feelings\u201d toward Molly Martens.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hate her, I just don\u2019t want to give her any power over me anymore,\u201d he said.",

I\u2019d say the hoodie and sweatpants is more in line with who I am. What can I say? I\u2019m gritty, raw, unapologetic. I\u2019ve always been that way. And a lot of times, especially when I was first starting out, it stood in the way of my success.\u201d",
      "Who else was in the Season 13 finale?",
      "Pearl wasn't the only big unveiling of the night. Boogie Woogie, Mad Scientist and Coral also made it to the finale and sang their hearts out while competing for the win.",
      "In the end, \"Zombies\" star Meg Donnelly was unmasked as Coral. Celebrity judge Rita Ora correctly guessed her identity and congratulated Donnelly, saying she \"really stood her own\" in the competition.",
      "While reflecting on her decision to join the cast of \"The Masked Singer,\" Donnelly said, \"I did this show to kind of get more comfortable on stage, singing. It's something I'm always really nervous about and insecure about and it's just helped me immensely.\"",
      "Mad Scientist turned out to be Brian Kelley, country singer and former\u00a0member of Florida Georgia Line. Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg guessed his identity correctly.",
      "Kelley said he wanted to \"challenge myself\" by signing on for the show.",
      "Boogie Woogie was unveiled as singer Andy Grammer, but none of the celebrity judges were able to guess his identity beforehand.",
      "\"It's been incredible to get to sing so many different songs and styles,\" he said about his experience on the show."

      "A new voice among Latin pop music, Taubert is cementing herself as one to watch with her heartbreak anthems, raw and sharp lyrics, catchy melodies and messages of empowerment and hope.",
      "Taubert has been catching the industry\u2019s and people\u2019s attention over the last year. The Colombian musician won the best new artist Latin Grammy Award in November, following her energetic performance of \u201c\u00bfC\u00f3mo Pas\u00f3?\u201d with Joe Jonas. She collaborated with the singer after she DM\u2019d him on Instagram \u2014 and he responded.",
      "\u201cWorking with Ela was one of those rare moments where the energy in the room just clicks. She has this beautiful vulnerability in her voice that immediately pulls you in,\u201d Jonas tells TODAY.com. \u201cFrom the first demo, I knew this song had heart \u2014 and collaborating with her just made it even more special. She brings so much truth to her music, and it was a privilege to be a part of that.\u201d",
      "The Jonas Brother adds that Taubert has a \u201cquiet power\u201d when it comes to her songwriting that \u201cfeels personal and poetic, but also universal. That balance is hard to find.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s creating her own space in Latin pop, and you can feel her heart in every lyric and melody. I love working with artists who have a real point of view, and she definitely does,\u201d he says.",

      "\u201cSince I was a little girl, anytime I would see the time 11:11 or the numbers together, I would make a wish,\u201d Taubert tells TODAY.com in Spanish about the significance of the album's title. \u201cI was always a horrible overthinker, a person who would ask myself the same questions over and over again.\u201d",
      "One night at 11:11 p.m., she recalls, she hoped a certain someone would write her back. They did.",
      "\u201cThen I began to think, \u2018Why did you ask for that?\u2019\u201d she says, making her further spiral. This nightly ritual of asking questions and making wishes inspired her album. \u201cThis is like a midnight diary of all the questions I\u2019ve asked myself over the last 10 years.\u201d",

In 2023, the singer caught the attention of Colombian reggaetonero Feid (and Billboard) when she put a melancholic twist on his song \u201cSi Te La Encuentras Por Ah\u00ed.\u201d From there, she began working with the Latin Grammy-winning Julio Reyes Copello and was part of the inaugural generation of aspiring singers in Universal Music Latino\u2019s Abbey Road Institute & Art House Academy.",

      "\u201cAll the song titles are questions, with Track 11 being the most special,\u201d Taubert teases. \u201cThe way they are listed is so people can feel a roller coaster of emotions, from falling in and out of love, making mistakes and growing up.\u201d",

      "'\u00bfQui\u00e9n Soy Yo Para Juzgar?'",
      "For Track Eight, Taubert asks, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d The spicy and in-your-face song, she says, is about her first boyfriend in school and what she\u2019s heard about him from her hometown friends.",

      "\"I was very young but it was my first heartbreak and it hit me hard,\" she says with a laugh. \"Looking back at it, I can laugh and say, 'You haven't changed at all!'\"",

      "She feels that many of her fans might not know that part of her, but hopes they can relate to the song and know it\u2019s OK to vent and let the frustration out.",
      "'Preguntas'",
      "Track 11, which translates to \u201cQuestions,\u201d is Taubert\u2019s \u201cmost personal\u201d song that touches on the special moments in her life. She describes the song as a sequel to her 2022 single \u201cCrecer\u201d and touches on the growing pains of life and everything she has gone through since moving to the U.S.",
      "Three years later, Taubert is making her dream come true as a singer-songwriter. Yet, as she sings in the track, she's lost half of her friends and has experienced the death of a loved one, her grandfather.",
      "\u201cI always thought I was very alone in how I felt about these types of situations, but my song \u2018Crecer\u2019 showed me that more people feel the way I do,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery lyric in this song describes every piece of who I am in the most blue and vulnerable way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe chorus says, \u2018You will be OK, I will be fine, so is life and you have to embrace it,\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "She and her producer Kevin Aguirre wrote the song last year during a blue moon and decided to incorporate the sound of the ocean that was nearby."

      "\u201cI have a lot of boots,\u201d she continues. \u201cThat\u2019s where we do our fittings for our projects. Last time I counted, I had 100 pairs of boots, and I think it\u2019s doubled since then.\u201d",

      "Reba McEntire on cowboy boot collection",
      "For those who can\u2019t incorporate a room filled with cowboy boots into their space, McEntire says she makes a house a home through pictures, family and pets. She says the location is also of importance, as well as \u201chow it makes you feel inside and out.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd then if the kitchen is really good,\u201d McEntire continues. \u201cI have to have a good kitchen, not because I\u2019m a good cook but because no matter how many people you bring over to your house for a party, everybody winds up in the kitchen.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s a very important place,\u201d she adds.",
      "Along with starring in her new television show, \u201cHappy\u2019s Place,\u201d and hosting the Academy of Country Music Awards May 8, McEntire was a judge on Season 26 of singing competition show, \u201cThe Voice.\u201d",
      "She did not, however, return for Season 27.",
      "When asked why she didn\u2019t reclaim her spot on the judges\u2019 panel, McEntire pointed to her busy agenda this year.",
      "\u201cOh, the scheduling was totally it,\u201d she says, before crediting a new Season 27 judge. \u201cI thought Kelsey Ballerini did such a great job. That was a really good pick with her.\u201d",
      "The energy and chemistry among \u201cThe Voice\u201d judges is \u201cvery important,\u201d McEntire says. \u201cFans are not stupid. They know when people are not getting along and they\u2019re acting like they are.\u201d",

      "As someone who sat next to Snoop Dogg for the entirety of the singing competition show season, McEntire says some fans might not realize that he \u201cgives out some of the best one-liners.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was so glad I got to sit by him because a lot of times he\u2019ll say stuff and people might not hear it, but I was very entertained all the time sitting by Snoop,\u201d McEntire adds.",
      "The virality of 'I'm a Survivor' over 20 years later",
      "If McEntire\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a Survivor\u201d doesn\u2019t resonate from being a Billboard No. 1 hit when it released in 2001, anyone on TikTok surely recognizes the tune.",
      "Ushering a new generation of McEntire fans, the song has gone viral on the social media platform, particularly the following lines: \u201cA single mom who works two jobs/ Who loves her kids and never stops/ With gentle hands and the heart of a fighter/ I\u2019m a survivor.\u201d",

      "When she was originally pitched the song, the three-time Grammy Award winner recalls listening and thinking about her cousin, who she says has \u201cbeen through an awful lot,\u201d then remembering her own journey.",
      "\u201cIt all goes back to a successful song is a song that people can relate to,\u201d McEntire says. \u201cAnd then when they relate to it, they sing along with it; and when they sing along with it, they\u2019re a part of the concert. They\u2019re part of the of every aspect of the song.\u201d",

      "Reminiscing on the \u201chealthy\u201d shifts within country music, McEntire says, \u201cIt's gone cyclical. It\u2019s gone contemporary. It\u2019s gone traditional. It\u2019ll go back and forth. It\u2019s a different kind of country music than what I grew up on.\u201d",

      "Reba McEntire on role of country artists",
      "When it comes to the greats, McEntire says her \"Mount Rushmore of country artists\" would be Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Barbara Mandrell and Merle Haggard.",
      "\u201cThey were very strong people who came from assorted backgrounds, most of them with very rough upbringings, with lessons that they can teach other people in their songs, in their stories, in their biographies, in their documentaries,\u201d McEntire says.",
      "She continued, \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019re put on Earth for \u2013 to help heal people who have hurts, and that you can help heal those hurts by past experiences.\u201d",
      "Music specifically, McEntire explains, is \u201cso valuable\u201d when it comes to healing because \u201cyou can tell in a song things that you can\u2019t tell in person because it might be too personal.\u201d",
      "As for whom she hopes to collaborate with next, McEntire says, \u201cI\u2019ve always said Bette Midler. I think she\u2019d be a hoot to create a song with.\u201d",
      "But McEntire gave another dream singing partner, who has taken the pop world by storm but has yet to publicly give country a try.",
      "\u201cDua Lipa, I met her at an award show last year, and I\u2019d never met her before. I was not familiar with her music,\u201d she says. \u201cNow in my concerts, I do \u2018Don\u2019t Start Now\u2019 I watched her documentaries and her concerts, and she\u2019s wonderful.\u201d",

    "summary": "Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel are \"worried about any deal\" President Trump might strike with Iran, one source told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0When President Donald Trump took office in January, he and Israeli Prime\u00a0Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were closely aligned on how to approach the most pressing issues in their relationship: the war in Gaza and aggression from Iran.",
      "Trump lifted a hold the Biden administration had put on sending large bombs to Israel. He encouraged Israeli military operations \u201cto finish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza. He agreed with Netanyahu on confronting Iran and its proxy groups in the region.",
      "But in recent weeks, the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu has become strained as the two leaders are increasingly at odds over a strategy for tackling these challenges now that Hamas has been significantly degraded and Iran weakened, according to two U.S. officials, two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "Where Netanyahu sees an opportunity to finally take out Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, Trump sees an opportunity to remove the threat of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon by making a deal. As Israel hits Gaza with a new military offensive, Trump is pushing for a ceasefire and looking to implement his postwar plan for rebuilding the area into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d And after Trump halted the U.S. military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthi militant group, a shocked Netanyahu said Israel would then defend itself.",
      "The recent differences between the two leaders on key strategies and positions has put Trump\u2019s relationship with one of America\u2019s closest allies at a bit of a crossroads. How they navigate their disagreements going forward will shape the outcome of some of the core components of the president\u2019s foreign policy agenda.",
      "Twice in just this past week alone, Trump made public comments that rankled Netanyahu, the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions said.",
      "Netanyahu\u00a0was particularly upset when Trump said Wednesday that\u00a0he had yet to decide\u00a0whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium under a new nuclear deal his administration is negotiating, the two U.S. officials said. A top adviser to Netanyahu, Ron Dermer, conveyed that message to Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, during a meeting at the White House on Thursday, according to\u00a0one of the\u00a0U.S. officials.",
      "For his part, Trump has been frustrated with Netanyahu\u2019s decision to begin a new military offensive in Gaza, which the president sees as at odds with his plan for rebuilding there, according to one of the U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the tensions between the two leaders.",
      "Privately, Trump has said the new Israeli offensive in Gaza is a wasted effort because it will make it harder to rebuild, according to those two sources.",
      "The U.S. is currently pushing Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza, which Dermer was set to discuss with Witkoff during his White House visit this week, according to the Middle Eastern diplomats and a senior Trump administration official.",
      "But\u00a0Trump\u2019s approach to Iran has been the biggest point of contention for Netanyahu.",
      "The Israeli leader has been frustrated for weeks with Trump\u2019s refusal to support military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and his decision to instead\u00a0try to reach a deal aimed at blocking Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, according to the two U.S. officials, the\u00a0two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re worried about any deal,\u201d one of the U.S. officials said of the Israelis.",
      "Israel has made clear to the U.S. that it does not want Trump to cut a nuclear deal that leaves Iran with any uranium enrichment capabilities, the U.S. officials and Middle Eastern diplomats said. Trump has expressed an openness to Iran maintaining a civilian nuclear program.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t made that decision yet,\u201d Trump said Wednesday when asked if the U.S. position is that Iran can have a uranium enrichment program for civilian nuclear purposes.",
      "\u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump,\u201d\u00a0James Hewitt, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement responding to this story. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East. As he has repeatedly stated in his first and second terms, the president is committed to ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "A third U.S. official said the president\u2019s team has communicated with Israeli officials regularly about the status of negotiations with Iran, providing updates and coordinating on elements of a potential deal.",
      "Netanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u2018Trump has his own agenda\u2019",
      "Netanyahu was\u00a0blindsided \u2014 and infuriated \u2014\u00a0this past week\u00a0by Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. was halting its military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen after the\u00a0Houthis\u00a0agreed to stop firing on U.S. ships in the Red Sea, according to\u00a0one of the U.S. officials and\u00a0the\u00a0two Middle East diplomats.",
      "The Houthis had just attacked Israel with a missile that hit close to Ben Gurion, Israel\u2019s main airport.",
      "When Netanyahu visited the White House last month, for the second time since Trump took office,\u00a0he hoped\u00a0the president\u00a0would pledge U.S. air support for a possible Israeli operation against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, according to the two Middle Eastern diplomats. The Israeli leader was taken aback when the president instead announced he would agree to direct talks with Tehran, the diplomats said.",
      "Netanyahu has privately said\u00a0he thinks\u00a0Trump\u2019s negotiations with Iran are a waste of time because Tehran will never hold up its end of any deal, according to the two U.S. officials. Israel has argued that Iran is so weakened by economic sanctions and the degradation of its proxies in the region that now is an ideal moment to take out its nuclear facilities, and it is concerned the window for doing so is closing while the U.S. negotiates, the officials said.",
      "Adding to that concern about timing,\u00a0Israeli military strikes\u00a0crippled Iranian strategic air defenses in October,\u00a0meaning manned aircraft conducting new strikes now\u00a0would not be as susceptible to being shot down. But the Iranians are rebuilding their air defenses.",
      "Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham said this week that the only acceptable Iran deal is one that completely stops Tehran from any uranium enrichment. They also urged Trump to submit any Iran nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification, which requires a two-thirds majority vote.",
      "Asked about Cotton and Graham\u2019s comments, a fourth U.S. official said Witkoff is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Graham about Iran negotiations and briefed Cotton on them this past week.",
      "The 2015 Iran nuclear deal reached by President Barack Obama was not ratified by the Senate, which allowed Trump to simply withdraw the U.S. from the agreement during his first term.",
      "\u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is the Israelis recognizing that as much as they welcomed the election of President Trump and thought that would really give them a blank check to pursue whatever agenda they wanted, Trump has his own agenda,\u201d Frank Lowenstein,\u00a0a former Middle East envoy under the Obama administration,\u00a0said during a virtual briefing organized by J Street, an advocacy organization that describes itself as pro-Israel and pro-peace.",
      "Although Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Iran and the U.S. deal with the Houthis are \u201canathema\u201d to Netanyahu, the prime minister does not have the political leverage in Washington or Israel to enter into a direct confrontation with Trump, who is popular with\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s\u00a0base in Israel, said Ilan Goldenberg, who worked on Middle East policy\u00a0as a senior official during\u00a0the Biden and Obama administrations.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cwhole political strategy and survival strategy is based on holding his coalition and holding his political base together,\u201d Goldenberg said in the briefing organized by J Street. \u201cAnd those folks love Trump, so for him to go very publicly against Trump is something he really can\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "The strain\u00a0in\u00a0the relationship between\u00a0Trump and\u00a0Netanyahu comes as the president is set\u00a0to\u00a0travel to the Middle East next week, with stops\u00a0scheduled\u00a0in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

      "MOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir Putin of Russia said early Sunday that his country is committed to restart direct talks with Kyiv about ending their war, and suggested the next discussions begin May 15 in Turkey.",
      "He said he was scheduled to speak to Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, later Sunday with hopes of holding talks next week in Istanbul. There would be no preconditions on Russia's part, he said.",
      "Putin said Ukraine walked away from such talks in the past and broke ceasefire agreements, though both sides have been blamed for attacks during the last three ceasefires. He used language that expressed his desire for serious talks with long-term consequences, including long-lasting peace.",
      "Putin\u2019s comments came on the last day of the three-day ceasefire declared by Russia, and almost immediately after leaders from the United Kingdom, France, Poland and Germany threatened to increase sanctions against the nation if he does not accept an unconditional, 30-day ceasefire starting Monday.",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz made the demand for an unconditional ceasefire in a news briefing, which included over 30 countries that have pledged to strengthen Ukraine. They also joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the memorial of fallen Ukrainian soldiers at independence square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Saturday.",
      "The leaders said the proposal to start the ceasefire Monday was supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, whom they had briefed over the phone earlier in the day.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The ceasefire aims to enforce a halt to fighting on land, sea and air. The world leaders\u2019 show of force came amid mounting efforts to persuade Moscow to agree to a truce that would allow for peace talks on ending over three years of war.",
      "Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, said on X on Saturday that such a ceasefire could \"start the process for ending the largest and longest war in Europe since World War II.\"",
      "Kellogg enlisted a quote from Trump \u2014 \"stop the killing now\" \u2014 to bolster his own statement in support of a 30-day ceasefire.",
      "Putin has previously said he wants Ukraine to withdraw from four regions \u2014 Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 which Russia illegally annexed shortly after invading Ukraine in February 2022. He has also insisted that Ukraine promise never to join NATO, accept restrictions on the size of its army, and protect Russian culture and language inside the country.",
      "Last week, Putin said Russia had sufficient strength and resources to take the war in Ukraine to its logical conclusion, though he hoped there would be no need to use nuclear weapons."

      "From outside of his Cabinet, Netanyahu has faced growing criticism for resuming and expanding Israel's offensive in Gaza. The latest denunciation came from Eran Duvdevani, a prominent retired colonel who led a campaign by former and reserve Israeli paratroopers calling for an end to the war.",
      "Duvdevani told NBC News that a growing number of reservists were already rejecting calls to return to service in a war they increasingly view as politically motivated.",
      "He added that without a fresh truce between Israel and Hamas, Trump's intervention was likely the only thing that could stop an expanded offensive.",
      "\"This is the only way, to press Netanyahu,\" Duvdevani said in a phone interview early Tuesday. \"Nothing will happen if Trump will not press him.\"",

      "\u201cNobody does drama like the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church,\u201d said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, shortly after emerging from the conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV on Thursday.",
      "The quick decision, made some 33 hours after the Sistine Chapel's doors closed and the cardinals went into sequestration, was a sign that they likely entered the conclave with enough unity around the decision to continue Francis' legacy that they did not have to spend days tussling over a new direction for the Vatican.",
      "In the weeks ahead of the conclave, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, Archbishop of Newark, said in a joint press conference with five other American cardinals on Friday. \u201cWe listened to each other. What does the church need? What does the world need? What are we hoping for? What are we dreaming about?\u201d",
      "Leo, previously Cardinal Robert Prevost, a U.S. native with Peruvian citizenship and deep ties to Latin America, is described by the Vatican as the \u201csecond pope from the Americas,\u201d to Francis\u2019 first. He is known to have been close to the late pontiff, both in their daily dealings at the Vatican, and ideologically.",
      "Like Francis, Leo is known for his concern for the poor and marginalized, and in his first Sunday blessing as pope, quoted Francis and called for ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza, the subjects of Francis' final message to the world.",
      "The conclave is shrouded in secrecy, and many of the dealings that lead up to it remain in the shadows, but since the end of the conclave some cardinals have offered glimpses to what happened in the hours that led up to Leo\u2019s election.",
      "Once the Sistine Chapel's doors close, the cardinals swear an oath of \"absolute and perpetual secrecy,\" as do all\u00a0Vatican\u00a0staff assisting them, including cooks, cleaners and drivers. Mobile phones are confiscated, an ancient reason for a digital detox that at least one cardinal, Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, appreciated for giving him \u201cmore time on my hands just to be prayerful, just to reflect, just to be still, rather than being constantly agitated,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On the first evening, the cardinals cast their first round votes, but black smoke billowed from the chimney, meaning no pope was chosen.",
      "The cardinals adjourned for the night to Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse were most of them were staying \u2014 and eating. Cardinal Wilton Gregory said that \"a lot of dialog occurred at mealtime, coffee breaks, those moments when you can engage in smaller groups.\"",
      "\u201cThe only method is the human method, to get to talk to another, the dialogue, to listen to one another,\" Cardinal Robert McElroy, Archbishop of Washington, said, about the conversations that eventually lead to the two-thirds majority required to elect a pope.",
      "The next morning the cardinals returned to the Sistine Chapel and two more ballots were cast, but black smoke emerged once again.",
      "\u201cVoting is like watching a glacier move, but sometimes glaciers under stress move a lot faster,\u201d Tobin said.",
      "Despite wide speculation on pabalili in the wake of Francis' death, once the conclave began, we don't know who the other frontrunners were, or why they fell behind. But Dolan told CNN that Prevost's name had begun to emerge from relative obscurity even before the conclave began. And he continued to confer with his brother cardinals into the conclave.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that he stood up and made this overwhelmingly convincing speech that just wowed,\u201d said Gregory. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any particular intervention, but I do believe he engaged quite effectively in the smaller group conversations.\u201d",
      "And while conclaves in centuries past could stretch for weeks, Prevost's election began to take shape on the second day.",
      "Or as Gregory framed it: \u201cThere was a great movement on the second day, a great movement within the body that was there and there could be nothing other than the grace of God moving us toward this consensus.\"",
      "\u201cWhat I experience is that everything begins in politics and finishes mystic,\u201d added McElroy.",
      "Tobin recalled the moment after casting his vote. \u201cI walked back and I took a look at Bob, and because his name had been floating around, and he had his head in his hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI was praying for him, because I couldn\u2019t imagine what happens to a human being when you\u2019re facing something like that.\u201d",
      "During a press conference on Saturday, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, himself considered one of the leading candidates for pope, said he was seated next to Prevost.",
      "In the minutes after his election, when the new pope was gasping for air as the weight of his new role descended on him, Tagle said he asked him if he wanted a piece of candy. Prevost accepted and Tagle pulled one from a pocket beneath his cardinal\u2019s robe, \u201cthat\u2019s my first act of charity,\" he said he told Prevost, jokingly, \"for our new Holy Father.\u201d",
      "Soon after, Prevost emerged on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica as Pope Leo XIV, proof of an efficient and sucessful conclave.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t our first rodeo,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this 268 times.\u201d"

      "CHICLAYO, Peru \u2014 Walkiria Garcia was 14 years old when she made her confirmation in the Catholic Church, an already significant religious sacrament made even more unforgettable by the man officiating it, Robert Prevost, who a decade later would become Pope Leo XIV.",
      "To many Peruvians, however, Leo is more than the first pope from the U.S. He is also the first Peruvian pope.",
      "Pope Leo, born on the South Side of Chicago, first arrived in Peru in 1985 as a missionary. For 10 years, he taught canon law in Trujillo, immersing himself in the local culture and community.",
      "Though he returned to Chicago to lead the Augustinian order in the Midwest, he couldn\u2019t stay away for too long. In 2014, he moved to Chiclayo, Peru, where he served as an apostolic administrator, bishop and later archbishop. He even became a naturalized Peruvian citizen in 2015.",
      "Now, Garcia has one message for the new pontiff: \u201cDon\u2019t change.\u201d",
      "Garcia, now 24, recalls her first encounter with Leo at her Augustinian school, saying she felt like he was more of a friend than an authority figure.",
      "That\u2019s because Leo was \u201cfun,\u201d and was frequently seen playing games with the students in addition to speaking to them about religious topics.",
      "Garcia said the former bishop shared messages of love and openness with the students, in line with their Augustinian beliefs.",
      "\u201cWe can always return and we can always change our life,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "Leo\u2019s deep bond with Peruvians is rooted in his embrace of their customs. Garcia fondly remembers seeing him at cultural festivals, serving food and participating in traditions. \u201cHe was Peruvian,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "In his first speech as pope, Leo expressed gratitude to the people of Chiclayo, highlighting the city\u2019s influence on his journey.",

      "Garcia hopes that Leo will \u201cfollow the Francis message,\u201d continuing to \u201clove all people\u201d and embracing members of the LGBTQ community. She would like to see him continue his work with children and young adults, just as he did in Chiclayo.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 In a show of unity in Kyiv on Saturday, leaders from four major European countries threatened to ratchet up pressure if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.",
      "The leaders, from France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland, said the proposal to start the ceasefire on Monday was supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, whom they had briefed over the phone earlier in the day. Their statement came amid mounting efforts to persuade Moscow to agree to a truce that would allow for peace talks on ending over three years of full-scale war.",
      "The demand was announced in a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and countries leading the so-called \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d: a group of over 30 countries who have pledged to strengthen Ukraine to deter Russian aggression. They included French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who on Saturday traveled to Ukraine together for the first time.",
      "The ceasefire would include a halt to fighting on land, sea and in the air. The leaders threatened to ratchet up sanctions, including on Russia\u2019s energy and banking sectors, if Putin did not comply.",
      "Earlier that day, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Kyiv and its allies are ready for a \u201cfull, unconditional ceasefire\u201d with Russia for \u201cat least 30 days\u201d starting Monday. He added the four visiting leaders and Zelenskyy had had a \u201cconstructive\u201d phone call with Trump.",
      "Saturday marked the last day of a unilateral three-day ceasefire declared by Russia that Ukraine says the Kremlin\u2019s forces have repeatedly violated.",
      "In March, the United States proposed an immediate, limited 30-day truce, which Ukraine accepted, but the Kremlin has held out for\u00a0terms more to its liking.",
      "Building up Ukraine\u2019s military capabilities will be a key deterrent against Russia, the European leaders said Saturday. This will require supplying Ukraine with robust quantities of arms to deter future attacks and investing in its defense sector. A force comprised of foreign troops could also be deployed as an added \u201creassurance\u201d measure, Macron said.",
      "The French president added that the United States will take the lead in monitoring a proposed cease-fire, with support from European countries, and threatened \u201cmassive sanctions ... prepared and coordinated between Europeans and Americans,\u201d should Russia violate the truce.",
      "But he said details about potential European deployments to Ukraine were still being fine-tuned. No mention was made of NATO membership, still Kyiv\u2019s top choice for a security guarantee.",
      "The priority is to make the war too costly for Russia to keep fighting, Ukraine\u2019s Sybiha told reporters on the sidelines of the event.",
      "Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said Saturday that a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d 30-day ceasefire, covering attacks from the air, land, sea and on infrastructure, \u201cwill start the process for ending the largest and longest war in Europe since World War II.\u201d",
      "Earlier on Saturday, the European leaders joined a ceremony at Kyiv\u2019s Independence Square marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. They lit candles alongside Zelenskyy at a\u00a0makeshift flag memorial\u00a0for fallen Ukrainian soldiers and civilians slain since Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to an agreement to end the war, but while Zelenskyy agreed to the American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, Russia has not signed on. Instead, it has kept up attacks along the roughly 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer) front line,\u00a0including deadly strikes on residential areas with no obvious military targets.",
      "On Saturday morning, local officials in Ukraine\u2019s northern Sumy region said Russian shelling over the past day killed three residents and wounded four more. Another civilian man died on the spot on Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Kyiv, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Poland, Germany and Great Britain is a historic moment for European defense and toward a greater independence for our security. Obviously, for Ukraine and all of us. It\u2019s a new era. It\u2019s a Europe that sees itself as a power.\u201d",
      "Trump said last week that he doubts Putin wants to end his\u00a0war in Ukraine, expressing new skepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon, and\u00a0hinted at further sanctions against Russia.",
      "Progress on ending the war has seemed elusive in the months since Trump returned to the White House, and his previous claims of imminent breakthroughs have failed to come to fruition. Trump has previously pushed Ukraine to cede territory to Russia to end the war,\u00a0threatening to walk away if a deal becomes too difficult.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s European allies view its fate as fundamental to the continent\u2019s security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily, regardless of whether Trump pulls out."

      "GENEVA \u2014 The U.S. treasury secretary and America\u2019s top trade negotiator began talks with high-ranking Chinese officials in Switzerland Saturday aiming to de-escalate a dispute that threatens to cut off trade between the world\u2019s two biggest economies and damage the global economy.",
      "China\u2019s Xinhua News Agency says Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer have begun meetings in Geneva with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng.",
      "Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks have begun but spoke anonymously and the exact location of the talks wasn\u2019t made public. However, a motorcade of black cars and vans was seen leaving the home of the Swiss Ambassador to the United Nations in the wealthy Swiss city, and a diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the meeting, said the sides met for about two hours before departing for a previously arranged luncheon.",
      "Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they\u2019ve slapped on each other\u2019s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries\u2019 boycotting each other\u2019s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Even before the talks began, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \u201c 80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u201d",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\u201cThe best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\u201d she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \u201cIt cannot just be words.\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example, imposed a 10% tax on imports from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump\u2019s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2014 such as China\u2019s subsidies \u2014 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn\u2019t come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China\u2019s tech policy now resumes.",
      "Trump is also agitated by America\u2019s massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland, Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Trump last month suspended plans to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he\u2019s reduced those taxes to 10% but could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\u201cAn increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland\u2019s interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\u201d the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \u201cis therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\u201d",
      "The government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another 21% beginning Wednesday.",
      "The United States is Switzerland\u2019s second-biggest trading partner after the EU \u2014 a 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",
      "The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free."

      "MOSCOW \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy broke with long-standing protocol by not employing his own interpreter during three high-level meetings with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, opting instead to rely on translators from the Kremlin, a U.S.\u00a0official and two Western officials with knowledge of the talks told NBC News.",
      "Steve Witkoff, who has been tasked with negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, met with Putin in Moscow for several hours on Feb. 11, on March 13, and in St. Petersburg on April 11, and \u201cused their translators,\u201d one of the Western officials said. \u201cIf they speak to each other in Russian, he doesn\u2019t know what they are saying,\u201d the official added, referring to Putin and the interpreters.",
      "Witkoff, a former real estate mogul and cryptocurrency trader, does not speak Russian. By using Kremlin interpreters, he ran the risk that some of the nuance in Putin\u2019s messages was missed and he would not have been able to independently verify what was being said to him, two former American ambassadors said.",
      "Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, said in a statement that Witkoff \u201cabides by all security protocols in coordination with the State Department.\u201d  Witkoff\u2019s team did not respond. Both the State Department and the Kremlin have also been asked for comment.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have been killed since Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump campaigned on ending the war on \u201cday one\u201d and has made it one of his top priorities. Putin, meanwhile, has shown little interest in ending the conflict, and in remarks broadcast Sunday, referenced Russia\u2019s nuclear capability as he talked about bringing the war to an end.",
      "The Russian leader, who is known to speak some English, communicates through an interpreter during negotiations and when he is conducting official meetings. At a meeting with Witkoff on April 25, he was flanked by his special adviser Yuri Ushakov, who served as Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States between 1998 and 2008, and Kirill Dmitriev, his special envoy for investment and economic cooperation. An interpreter joined Putin\u2019s team.",
      "A short video of the meeting released by the Kremlin shows a smiling Witkoff entering the room alone before he shakes hands with Putin, who is also broadly beaming. Witkoff does not appear to be accompanied by any advisers or experts who typically support American officials conducting delicate and complicated negotiations.",
      "As a woman joined Witkoff on his side of the table, he pointed at her and\u00a0said, \u201cInterpreter? From the embassy? OK.\u201d",
      "Kelly, the White House deputy press secretary and Witkoff\u2019s team did not identify the woman when asked by NBC News. The State Department, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and the Kremlin have also been asked for comment.",
      "Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said using the Kremlin\u2019s interpreter was \u201ca very bad idea\u201d that put Witkoff \u201cat a real disadvantage.\u201d",
      "\u201cI speak Russian and have listened to Kremlin interpreters and U.S. interpreters at the same meeting, and the language is never the same,\u201d McFaul said via email Wednesday.",
      "Having a U.S. interpreter present also ensures a more accurate written account of the meeting for the rest of the government, known as a memorandum of conversation or \u201cmemcon,\u201d said McFaul, now professor of political science at Stanford University.",
      "\u201cAt the end of every meeting that I attended, I debriefed the interpreter to make sure we heard everything correctly, to get the \u2018memcom\u2019 exactly right. You can\u2019t do that using a Russian official,\u201d he added.",
      "Not having detailed notes about the meetings could create problems for other senior members of the Trump administration, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, as they try to advance discussions, McFaul said.",
      "\u201cHow does Kellogg know what Witkoff agreed to with Putin? He only knows it through a \u2018memcom,\u2019\u201d he added.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s dealings with sensitive information as he plays a key role in trying to resolve not only the war in Ukraine, but also the conflict in Gaza and the nuclear deal with Iran, have also raised eyebrows.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s plane, which he uses to fly to Russia for the meetings, is not fitted with a secure government communications system, according to two Western officials, including one previously quoted in this article. However, the officials said he has made sensitive calls from the U.S. Embassy before boarding the plane and has a secure cellphone.",
      "NBC News approached the White House National Security Council for comment and was referred to Witkoff\u2019s team, which did not respond. The State Department has also been asked for comment.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s efforts appear to have yielded little results in ending the war, at least from Russia\u2019s side.",
      "A proposal that Trump should meet with Putin on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week was nixed because there was no movement on Russia\u2019s part toward a ceasefire, according to two administration officials and one U.S. official familiar with the planning. A meeting would have been contingent on Russia agreeing to a ceasefire in Ukraine, the administration officials said.",
      "Separately, a European official said intelligence assessments indicate Putin remains committed to maximalist goals in the war in Ukraine and has no interest in coming to a negotiated settlement.",
      "Putin has previously said he wants Ukraine to withdraw from four regions \u2014 Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 which Russia illegally annexed shortly after invading Ukraine in February 2022. He has also insisted that Ukraine promise never to join NATO, accept restrictions on the size of its army, and protect Russian culture and language inside the country.",
      "Since his last meeting with Witkoff, the White House has signed an \u201ceconomic partnership\u201d with Ukraine that will give Washington access to some of the war-torn nation\u2019s critical minerals and natural resources.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians have been cooperative, flexible, supportive and eager to move forward, but the Russians have not,\u201d said William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and now a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, adding that it was \u201cstandard, basic practice that you have your own interpreter,\u201d in high-level diplomatic meetings.",
      "Ukraine, he said, had agreed to U.S. proposals on a comprehensive air, sea and land ceasefire, while extending a truce to Black Sea shipping lanes.",
      "A \u201cterm sheet\u201d with 22 proposals, including a 30-day ceasefire, has been drawn up by American, European and Ukrainian negotiators, one of the Western officials said, adding that it met Putin\u2019s demand that the U.S. will not support Ukraine joining NATO.",
      "\u201cIf Putin wants a way out, here is his way out,\u201d the official said of the proposals. Witkoff will have to present them to the Russian president, they added.",
      "In remarks published Sunday, Putin said Russia had sufficient strength and resources to take the war in Ukraine to its logical conclusion, though he hoped there would be no need to use nuclear weapons.",
      "In a film broadcast by state television titled \u201cRussia, Kremlin, Putin, 25 years,\u201d he said, \u201cThere has been no need to use those weapons ... and I hope they will not be required.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is a provocation of the highest order,\u201d Sharif said. There was no immediate comment from India.",
      "State-run Pakistan Television reported that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has convened a meeting of the National Command Authority, the body responsible for overseeing the country\u2019s missile program and other strategic assets.",
      "Tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals have soared since an attack at a popular tourist site in India-controlled Kashmir left 26 civilians dead, mostly Hindu Indian tourists, on April 22. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan for backing the assault, an accusation Islamabad rejects.",

      "The call for calm came ahead of Saturday\u2019s Indian missile strikes, which targeted Nur Khan air base in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, Murid air base in Chakwal city and Rafiqui air base in the Jhang district of eastern Punjab province, according to Pakistan\u2019s military spokesman.",
      "There was no media access to the air base in Rawalpindi, a densely populated city, and no immediate reports of residents hearing or seeing the strike or its aftermath.",

      "\u201cExplosions that we are hearing today are different from the ones we heard the last two nights during drone attacks,\u201d said Shesh Paul Vaid, the region\u2019s former top police official and Jammu resident. \u201cIt looks like a war here.\u201d",
      "Vaid said explosions were heard from areas with military bases, adding it appeared that army sites were being targeted.",
      "Srinagar appeared calm early Saturday but some residents in neighborhoods close to the city\u2019s airport, which is also an air base, said they were rattled by the explosions and booming sound of fighter jets.",

      "Fumiya Takenawa attended Expo 2025 in the city of Osaka with a ticket that was originally issued for the Grand International Exposition of Japan in 1940, the organizers of this year's event said said in a statement on Monday.",
      "They added that the original event did not take place because of Japan\u2019s \u201cintensifying war\u201d in the region.",

      "But after wondering whether it could be used for this year's event, he said he approached the organizers who agreed he could use it.",
      "\u201cThis is my first expo, and I feel part of history,\u201d he said, adding that he visited the Czech and Saudi Arabian pavilions at the expo. \u201cThe person who had this ticket before me waited 85 years, and now their wish finally came true,\u201d he said.",
      "Although he lives in Tokyo, he said he would like to revisit the expo when he travels to Osaka to see his family.",
      "The Expo, also known as World\u2019s Fair, showcases scientific, technological, economic, and social progress from around the planet.

      "The election of an American as pope is being recognized as a historic choice, but Chicago-born missionary Robert Prevost represents another notable departure from pontiffs of the past.",
      "Prevost, 69, is the first Augustinian friar to become pope, the Vatican News reported.",
      "\"The fact that the pope is from the Augustinian order is the most surprising thing for me,\" Charles Gillespie, an assistant professor of Catholic Studies at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, said Friday. \"It's extraordinary, and it's been rare for a reason.\"",
      "Prevost, who took the name Leo XIV after being elected Thursday to guide the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, had assumed several leadership roles within the Catholic Order of St. Augustine.",
      "The order, formed in the 13th century and based on the writings of Augustine of Hippo, a theologian who lived in modern-day Algeria, is smaller compared to other religious communities within the church. It has about 2,800 members in 47 countries, and sponsors just two universities within the United States: Villanova near Philadelphia, which Prevost attended, and Merrimack College in Massachusetts.",
      "Friars of the Augustinian order typically stand out in hooded black habits made of wool. Rather than being cloistered in a monastery, they live a mendicant lifestyle, in which they go out into the community and rely on charitable kindness, Gillespie said.",
      "\u201cThey place a real, prayerful emphasis on the heart, and the beauty in the world as it connects with God,\u201d he added.",
      "An Augustinian friars\u2019 purpose is to serve with humility within their communities. Until Leo, it was unlikely that a member would be called on to leave the order and take on a larger responsibility in the upper echelons of the Catholic Church, much less become pope, Gillespie said.",
      "The largest male Catholic order is the Jesuits, with about 16,000 members worldwide and more than two dozen higher education institutions in the U.S.",
      "Notably, Prevost's predecessor, Francis, was the first Jesuit \u2014 and first from Latin America \u2014 to become pope.",
      "Historically, popes have not been associated with any specific religious order, but instead have been former priests who've ascended the church's hierarchy from diocesan seminaries and parishes. Before Francis, the last pope from a religious order was Gregory XVI, a Benedictine Camaldolese monk who was pope from 1831 to 1846, according to America magazine, a Jesuit publication.",
      "\"I cannot help but reflect on what his Augustinian papacy will mean to our University community and our world,\" the Rev. Peter Donohue, president of Villanova, said in a statement. \"Known for his humility, gentle spirit, prudence and warmth, Pope Leo XIV's leadership offers an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to our educational mission.\"",
      "In 1977, the year that he graduated from Villanova, Prevost joined the Order of St. Augustine. He would go on to be ordained as a priest in 1982 and then sent to an Augustinian mission in Peru in 1985.",
      "Upon returning to his hometown, Chicago, in 1999, Prevost was promoted within the order's ranks until Francis elevated him as a bishop in Peru in 2015, and eventually rising to a cardinal in 2023. One of his last jobs before becoming pope was in Rome, running the office that helps decide who will be appointed a bishop.",
      "Martin Luther, who in the 16th-century would reject Catholicism and become central to the Protestant Reformation, was a former Augustinian friar.",
      "Gillespie said given Pope Leo's background, he is certain to follow in Francis' footsteps when it comes to being a moral voice focused on unity, humanity and understanding social issues.",
      "\"With Augustinians, there's going to be a real sense that our political involvements and spiritual commitments can't be in separate lanes,\" he said. \"They're about responding to the world, how we organize our social lives, and knowing it's centered out of God's love.\""

      "Pope Leo XIV, the first American to ascend to the papacy, has voted in three Republican primary elections since 2012, state voting records show.",
      "Records from Will County show a Robert F. Prevost (the new pontiff's birth name) registered in the county using an address that belongs to the pope's brother. His brother confirmed that Prevost receives his mail at that address as well. Those records show Prevost voting in the 2012, 2014 and 2016 Republican primaries, as well as in the 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2024 general elections.",
      "Voters in Illinois do not register by party, so Prevost's decision to vote in Republican primaries doesn't necessarily mean he is a Republican. Instead, voters can select which party's primary they want to vote for each year, and are not bound to pick the same party year-to-year.",
      "Now that Prevost has been named pope, details like his voting history, social media footprint and more have gained new relevance.",
      "An occasional user of social media in recent years, Prevost had occasionally posted on X criticism of President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, as well as their policies. One recent post from another user that Prevost shared on his account criticizes Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u00a0of Maryland, linking to a Catholic newspaper piece.",
      "Prevost also posted links to stories with headlines critical of Vance, who is Catholic, as well as posts about protecting immigrants, reducing gun violence and combating climate change."
