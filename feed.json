      "PARIS -- Actor George Clooney and his wife Amal Clooney were granted French citizenship because \u201cthey contribute, through their distinguished actions, to France\u2019s international influence and cultural outreach,\u201d the French government said Wednesday, defending their naturalization that was questioned by a junior French minister.",
      "The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the \u201cOcean\u2019s\u201d series of heist movies, his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their twins Ella and Alexander were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.",
      "Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior minister at the Interior Ministry, expressed misgivings Wednesday that some of the Clooneys' new French compatriots may think that the star couple was granted special treatment. The actor speaks only what he himself says is \u201chorrible, horrible\" French.",
      "\u201cThe message being sent is not good,\u201d Vedrenne said in an interview with broadcaster France Info. \u201cThere is an issue of fairness that, in my eyes, is absolutely essential.\u201d",
      "The couple purchased an estate in France in 2021 and Clooney has said that it's their primary residence. Non-French residents of France have multiple possible routes to becoming naturalized. It wasn\u2019t clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the Clooneys were eligible for citizenship under a French law that allows for the naturalization of foreign nationals who contribute to France's international influence and economic well-being.",
      "It argued that France's cinema industry will benefit from the actor's clout as a global movie star and said that as a lawyer, Amal Clooney regularly works with academic institutions and international organizations in France.",
      "\u201cThey maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry said.",
      "\u201cLike many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community,\" it concluded, giving the actor's first name a French twist by adding the \u201cs\u201d at the end.",

      "The Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has redefined what it means to be a global giant",
      "NEW YORK -- The Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has redefined what it means to be a global giant \u2014 and he may once again make history at the 2026 Grammy Awards.",
      "The artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio is up for six awards at the Feb. 1 show, becoming the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for album, song and record of the year simultaneously. His critically acclaimed album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d is only the second Spanish-language record to be nominated for album of the year. The first? Well, that also belonged to Bad Bunny, 2022\u2019s \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti.\u201d",
      "Win or lose, experts say Bad Bunny's Grammy nominations mark a symbolic moment for Latinos. Just a week later, after all, he'll headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "Vanessa D\u00edaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of \u201cP FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance,\u201d says Bad Bunny's nods extend beyond his own art and serve as a \u201cvery welcome recognition of Latin music that is growing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMusic from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean has been shaping global music tastes since the 19th century,\u201d adds Albert Laguna, associate professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale. \u201cBad Bunny is another link in a much longer chain of the popularity of Caribbean music on a global stage.\u201d",
      "Much of this music \u2014 particularly Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n, the genres Bad Bunny got his start in and continues to use in his new work \u2014 has been historically criminalized in Puerto Rico, not unlike hip-hop in the United States. Reggaet\u00f3n in particular, D\u00edaz points out, \u201ccomes from the most marginalized communities in Puerto Rico. And so, the fact that Bad Bunny is receiving nominations in three main categories, and this is an artist who came up with trap \u2026 is the most groundbreaking thing about the entire situation.\u201d",
      "Petra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of \u201cP FKN R,\u201d says that element is particularly noteworthy because institutions often ignore marginalized genres \u2014 including at the Latin Grammys, a sister award show to the Grammys.",
      "A victory in the major categories could have \u201cprofound, symbolic meaning,\u201d she says. But with a caveat: \u201cI\u2019m interested to see if this is going to open doors for other people.\u201d After all, Bad Bunny himself isn't immune to the Recording Academy\u2019s institutional biases: He already has three career Grammys, but all have been in m\u00fasica urbana categories \u2014 despite the fact that he is the most streamed artist on the planet.",
      "Across \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d Bad Bunny and his producers weave traditional Puerto Rican folkloric styles into a hyper-contemporary context. Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n aren't abandoned but fused with m\u00fasica j\u00edbara, salsa, bomba, plena and even aguinaldo, a kind of Christmas music, in \u201cPitorro de Coco.\u201d While Bad Bunny\u2019s previous albums also fused different genres \u2014 including bossa nova, mambo, rock, merengue and more \u2014 this album\u2019s melange was more homegrown.",
      "Laguna sees \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d as a direct challenge to the prevailing \u201cformula for global pop stardom,\u201d which he describes as an artist making it locally, gaining traction and then \u201cwatering down\u201d their sound into something commercial and palatable for a global audience.",
      "\u201cBad Bunny went in the opposite direction. It\u2019s his most Puerto Rican album ever,\u201d says Laguna. He hopes it will communicate to other artists that they, too, can look to their ancestry and history for artmaking.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much amazing Latin music that has been overlooked and that\u2019s part of what is so beautiful about this moment,\u201d says D\u00edaz. \u201cAnd that's why it feels like a win for all Latinos.\u201d",
      "The timing of the album's release and recognition, too, feels consequential. \u201cThe U.S. has a history of othering Latinos, othering the Spanish language. \u2026 We\u2019re in a moment where that feels extremely acute,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor a community that is being targeted on such a deep level, it is a little bit of light, a little bit of faith that we can still carve out our place here.\u201d",

      "Latinos and the Spanish-speaking community in the U.S. have grown increasingly wary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and routine hearings have turned into deportation traps for migrants.",
      "In an interview with i-D Magazine earlier this year, Bad Bunny mentioned that concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos factored into his decision not to tour in the continental U.S. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico itself since large-scale arrests began in late January.)",
      "\u201cThe content of the lyrics \u2014 which are so steeped in the history of Puerto Rico, political histories, tourism and gentrification \u2014 there\u2019s so much rich political and historical content,\u201d D\u00edaz adds. \u201cThis album is historic even without a Grammy win.\u201d",
      "But if Bad Bunny does win, D\u00edaz says, it will be \u201cakin to Halle Berry being the first Black woman to win an Oscar. That was a watershed moment. Or Rita Moreno being the first Latina to win.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, Laguna says the politics of the album are not exclusive to Puerto Rican or even Latino identity \u2014 \u201cthe lyrics on this album align with global struggles,\u201d he says. Take, for example, \u201cLo que le pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d (\u201cWhat happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for cultural autonomy in an era of neocolonialization.",
      "Rivera-Rideau says one of the reasons \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d has resonated is not just the political implications of using folkloric music in addition to m\u00fasica urbana, but its sound. The traditional genres are \u201ca lot more digestible\u201d to listeners who embrace the antiquated taboos surrounding Latin trap and scoff at reggaet\u00f3n's sexuality. As a result, the combination of sounds makes for an album that is \u201cpopular across generations,\u201d she says.",
      "But it only works because it is \u201cmusically really interesting. If it was just traditional music, and that's only what people cared about, it wouldn't have done as well as it did,\u201d she explains. \u201cMusically, it is super innovative and makes accessible a lot of these older genres that people in Puerto Rico listen to, but he\u2019s been able to globalize these very local genres in a way that no one else has.\u201d",
      "That intergenerational appeal was a feature of Bad Bunny's landmark Puerto Rican residency, with the age and global diversity of its audience.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel like this is a tense moment, it\u2019s a difficult moment. And here\u2019s someone giving us a sonic language in which to narrate this complex present,\u201d Laguna says. \u201cThere's pleasure, in political critique, that the music makes possible in a beautiful way. And I think that's very much welcomed.\u201d",

      "French 1960s sex symbol Brigitte Bardot has died at age 91",
      "PARIS -- Brigitte Bardot, the French 1960s sex symbol who became one of the greatest screen sirens of the 20th century and later a militant animal rights activist and far-right supporter, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals. Speaking to The Associated Press, he gave no cause of death, and said that no arrangements had been made for funeral or memorial services. She had been hospitalized last month.",
      "Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualized teen bride in the 1956 movie \u201cAnd God Created Woman.\u201d Directed by then husband Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.",
      "At the height of a cinema career that spanned more than two dozen films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolize a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blond hair, voluptuous figure and pouty irreverence made her one of France\u2019s best-known stars, even as she struggled with depression.",
      "Such was her widespread appeal that in 1969 her features were chosen to be the model for \u201cMarianne,\u201d the national emblem of France and the official Gallic seal. Bardot\u2019s face appeared on statues, postage stamps and coins.",
      "\u2018\u2019We are mourning a legend,'' French President Emmanuel Macron said in an X post.",
      "Bardot\u2019s second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She traveled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals. She also condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and she opposed Muslim slaughter rituals.",
      "\u201cMan is an insatiable predator,\u201d Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \u201cI don\u2019t care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\u201d",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots\u2019 respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest recognition.",
      "Later, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone. She frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims.",
      "She was convicted and fined five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred, in incidents inspired by her opposition to the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep during annual religious holidays.",
      "Bardot\u2019s 1992 marriage to fourth husband Bernard d\u2019Ormale, a onetime adviser to far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, contributed to her political shift. She described Le Pen, an outspoken nationalist with multiple racism convictions of his own, as a \u201clovely, intelligent man.\u201d",
      "In 2012, she supported the presidential bid of Marine Le Pen, who now leads her father's renamed National Rally party. Le Pen paid homage Sunday to an \u201cexceptional woman\u201d who was \u201cincredibly French.\u201d",
      "In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview that most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \u201chypocritical,\u201d because many played \u201cthe teases\u201d with producers to land parts.",
      "She said she had never had been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \u201ccharming to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass.\u201d",
      "Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born Sept. 28, 1934, to a wealthy industrialist. A shy child, she studied classical ballet and was discovered by a family friend who put her on the cover of Elle magazine at age 14.",
      "Bardot once described her childhood as \u201cdifficult\u201d and said that her father was a strict disciplinarian who would sometimes punish her with a horse whip.",
      "Vadim, a French movie produce who she married in 1952, saw her potential and wrote \u201cAnd God Created Woman\u201d to showcase her provocative sensuality, an explosive cocktail of childlike innocence and raw sexuality.",
      "The film, which portrayed Bardot as a teen who marries to escape an orphanage and then beds her brother-in-law, had a decisive influence on New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, and came to embody the hedonism and sexual freedom of the 1960s.",
      "The film was a box-office hit, and it made Bardot a superstar. Her girlish pout, tiny waist and generous bust were often more appreciated than her talent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassment to have acted so badly,\u201d Bardot said of her early films. \u201cI suffered a lot in the beginning. I was really treated like someone less than nothing.\u201d",

      "Nicolas\u2019 father was Jacques Charrier, a French actor who she married in 1959 but who never felt comfortable in his role as Monsieur Bardot. Bardot soon gave up her son to his father, and later said she had been chronically depressed and unready for the duties of being a mother.",
      "\u201cI was looking for roots then,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI had none to offer.\u201d",

      "With the exception of 1963\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cContempt,\u201d directed by Godard, Bardot\u2019s films were rarely complicated by plots. Often they were vehicles to display Bardot in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.",

      "She emerged a decade later with a new persona: An animal rights lobbyist, her face was wrinkled and her voice was deep following years of heavy smoking.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that sometimes I get carried away, but when I see how slowly things move forward ... my distress takes over,\u201d Bardot told the AP when asked about her racial hatred convictions and opposition to Muslim ritual slaughter,",

      "Hollywood has wrapped up a turbulent 2025 with big ticket sales for \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and \u201cMarty Supreme.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- Hollywood wrapped up a turbulent year with big ticket sales for \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and a box-office hit for Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet with \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d over a busy holiday weekend in movie theaters.",
      "As expected, James Cameron\u2019s latest trip to Pandora dominated ticket sales, collecting $88 million over the four-day Christmas-to-Sunday period and $64 million on the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Though \u201cFire and Ash\u201d initially opened notably softer domestically than its 2022 predecessor, \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water,\u201d it held better in its second weekend. It dipped just 28%, whereas \u201cWay of Water\u201d fell 53%.",
      "In two weeks, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has quickly amassed $217.7 million in North America for The Walt Disney Company. But the $400 million-budgeted film has been a massive draw internationally, grossing $542.7 million thus far overseas. To reach the box-office heights of the previous films, both of which rank among the biggest blockbusters ever, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will need to sustain business through New Year\u2019s and early January. If it does, \u201cAvatar\u201d could become the first franchise with three $2 billion movies.",
      "But much of the heat in theaters over Christmas and on the weekend belonged to \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d A24\u2019s biggest budget release, Josh Safdie\u2019s 1950s-set table tennis drama collected $27.1 million over the four-day weekend, a smash success for the indie studio.",
      "Chalamet went to great lengths to promote the acclaimed release, including appearing atop the Sphere in Las Vegas. The strong opening proved that the 30-year-old star has drawing power beyond most of his contemporaries, and it marked a rare box-office win for a wholly original film. Safdie\u2019s film carries a price tag of about $70 million.",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme\u201d even bested the film most analysts expected to rank number two: Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cAnaconda.\u201d The big-screen comedy, starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, collected $23.7 million over the four-day holiday weekend. That\u2019s still good for comedy, a genre most studios have abandoned in recent years. But \u201cAnaconda\u201d (50% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) was surely dinged by poor reviews.",
      "Hollywood is ending the year with its best Christmas Day box office since before the COVID-19 pandemic, a celebratory final note in what\u2019s been a rough year for the film industry. Going into the year, expectations were high for the industry\u2019s first year this decade not marred by pandemic or strike.",
      "\u201cIt was a really solid end to a tumultuous year,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt's been a roller-coaster ride. I think the best news for the industry \u2014 I know we kind of say this every year \u2014 but if you look at the lineup for 2026, it's pretty incredible.\u201d",
      "But domestic ticket sales on the year are ending roughly on par with the disappointing $8.75 billion in 2024. With three days left in 2025, the box-office total is $8.76 billion, according to Comscore. By comparison, in 2019, that total was $11.4 billion.",
      "That\u2019s a worrying development for theaters, which are now nervously watching Netflix attempt to buy one of Hollywood\u2019s most storied studios in Warner Bros. The highest grossing film of the year was a Chinese production, the $2 billion-generating \u201cNe Zha 2.\u201d The most-watched movie of 2025 was \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d a movie Sony Pictures sold to Netflix. Even the Oscars are headed to YouTube.",
      "What worked in 2025? PG-rated movies. For the second year in a row, PG-rated movies outperformed PG-13 ones. Domestically, PG films generated $2.87 billion, according to Comscore, while PG-13 movies collected $2.78 billion.",
      "The three biggest Hollywood blockbusters were all PG-rated: \u201cZootopia 2\u201d ($1.42 billion globally), \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d ($1.04 billion) and \"A Minecraft Movie\u201d ($958.2 million).",
      "\u201cZootopia 2\u201d even outranked the newcomers over the traditional weekend. In its fifth weekend, it earned another $20 million. Propelled by \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d Disney became the first studio since 2019 to cross $6 billion worldwide in the year.",
      "Yet expectations are already growing for a rebound year at the box office in 2026. Among the major titles upcoming are \u201cThe Super Mario Galaxy Movie,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man: Brand New Day,\u201d the live-action \u201cMoana,\u201d \u201cToy Story 5\u201d and \u201cThe Mandalorian and Grogu.\u201d",
      "The coming week, when schools are out and many people are off work, should be one of the busiest weeks of the year in theaters. Aside from the top films, a number of other releases will hope to capitalize.",
      "That includes Lionsgate's \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d the Paul Feig thriller starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried ($46.7 million in two weeks); \u201cDavid,\u201d the animated David and Goliath film from Angel Studios ($49.8 million in two weeks); Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants\u201d ($38.2 million in two weeks); and Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has announced the initial disbursement from its $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program",
      "States will share $10 billion for rural health care next year in a program that aims to offset the Trump administration's massive budget cuts to rural hospitals, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "But while every state applied for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, it won't be distributed equally. And critics worry that the funding might be pulled back if a state's policies don't match up with the administration's.",
      "Officials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years. States propose how to spend their awards, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns project officers to support each state, said agency administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.",
      "\u201cThis fund was crafted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed only six months ago now into law, in order to push states to be creative,\" Oz said in a call with reporters Monday.",
      "Under the program, half of the money is equally distributed to each state. The other half is allocated based on a formula developed by CMS that considered rural population size, the financial health of a state\u2019s medical facilities and health outcomes for a state\u2019s population.",
      "The formula also ties $12 billion of the five-year funding to whether states are implementing health policies prioritized by the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. Examples include requiring nutrition education for health care providers, having schools participate in the Presidential Fitness Test or banning the use of SNAP benefits for so-called junk foods, Oz said.",
      "Several Republican-led states \u2014 including Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas \u2014 have already adopted rules banning the purchase of foods like candy and soda with SNAP benefits.",
      "The money that the states get will be recalculated annually, Oz said, allowing the administration to \u201cclaw back\u201d funds if, for example, state leaders don't pass promised policies. Oz said the clawbacks are not punishments, but leverage governors can use to push policies by pointing to the potential loss of millions.",
      "\u201cI've already heard governors express that sentiment that this is not a threat, that this is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said.",
      "Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said she\u2019s heard from a number of Democratic-led states that refused to include such restrictions on SNAP benefits even though it could hurt their chance to get more money from the fund.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s why we added a $50 billion rural hospital fund, to help any hospital that\u2019s struggling,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cThis money is meant to keep hospitals afloat.\u201d",
      "But experts say it won't nearly offset the losses that struggling rural hospitals will face from the federal spending law's $1.2 trillion cut from the federal budget over the next decade, primarily from Medicaid. Millions of people are also expected to lose Medicaid benefits.",
      "Estimates suggest rural hospitals could lose around $137 billion over the next decade because of the budget measure. As many as 300 rural hospitals were at risk for closure because of the GOP\u2019s spending package, according to an analysis by The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.",
      "\u201cWhen you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know \u2014 that math does not add up,\u201d Cochran-McClain said.",
      "She also said there's no guarantee that the funding will go to rural hospitals in need. For example, she noted, one state\u2019s application included a proposal for healthier, locally sourced school lunch options in rural areas.",
      "And even though innovation is a goal of the program, Cochran-McClain said it's tough for rural hospitals to innovate when they were struggling to break even before Congress\u2019 Medicaid cuts.",

      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",

      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\u201cThe heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\u201d Otto said. \u201cIt makes a huge difference.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources, what the scientists call \u201climits of adaptation.\u201d The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",

      "The average American consumes 17 teaspoons of added sugar a day, which adds up to 57 pounds (26 kilograms) per year, according to the American Heart Association. About half of that comes from beverages, but much of the rest is sneaked into cereal, salsa, prepared sandwiches, dairy products, bottled sauces and baked goods, including many brands of whole-grain bread.",
      "To help control sugar intake, start by checking the nutrition label. Since 2021, food companies have been required to list the quantity of added sugars separately from total sugar content. But the plan backfired, Avena said.",

      "A nine-year-old boy, Youssef Shandaghi, died in Jabaliya in northern Gaza, not far from the so-called \u201cYellow Line,\" the ceasefire demarcation between the more than half of the Gaza Strip still held by the Israeli military and the rest of the territory, where most of the population lives.",
      "Two officials from Gaza\u2019s Shifa Hospital, Director Mohammed Abu Selmiya and Managing Director Rami Mhanna, said the boy was killed by Israeli gunfire coming from across the Yellow Line. Abu Selmiya cited the report from the doctor who received Shandaghi's body. Israel\u2019s military said it had no knowledge of the incident.",
      "But an uncle of the boy said he was killed by unexploded ordnance he had come across while playing. It was not immediately possible to reconcile the conflicting accounts.",
      "Israeli troops almost daily open fire on Palestinians who come too close to the Yellow Line, often killing or wounding some, according to medical personnel and witnesses. The Israeli military says it fires warning shots if someone crosses the line and fires at anyone judged to be posing a threat to troops. It has acknowledged some civilians have been killed, including young children.",
      "Since the ceasefire began, 416 Palestinians have been killed and 1,142 wounded in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry. The overall Palestinian death toll from the war is at least 71,271. The ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count, is staffed by medical professionals and maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by the international community.",

      "The teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made her first known visit to a sacred family mausoleum where the embalmed bodies of her late grandfather and great-grandfather are on display",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made her first known visit to a sacred family mausoleum, a step that experts say bolstered her status as her father's potential heir.",
      "The visit, which occurred on New Year\u2019s Day on Thursday, even sparked speculation that the girl, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 13, could be named a high-level official at the upcoming ruling Workers\u2019 Party congress.",
      "Images carried by North Korea\u2019s state media on Friday showed Kim Ju Ae standing in the front row with her parents and deeply bowing at Pyongyang's Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, where the embalmed bodies of her late grandfather and great-grandfather are on display.",
      "The palace is \u201ca place that symbolizes legitimacy of the North Korean regime\u201d and her visit there ahead of the Workers' Party congress is a politically orchestrated move, said Cheong Seong-Chang, deputy head of the private Sejong Institute in South Korea.",
      "Kim Jong Un, 41, is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea since the country's foundation in 1948. He often marks key state anniversaries by visiting the Kumsusan palace and paying respect to his father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung.",
      "Cheong predicted that Kim Jong Un could give his daughter the first secretary post at the Workers' Party, the party's No. 2 job, at the congress. Other experts say she is too young to accept such a high-profile post and might be provided with lower-level jobs.",

North Korea hasn't said when it will hold it, but the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's spy agency, said it likely will be held either in January or February.",
      "Since first appearing in state media in November 2022, Kim Ju Ae has accompanied her father at a slew of events including military parades and missile launches. In September, Kim Jong Un brought her on his trip to Beijing. During New Years' Day celebrations this week, she kissed her father on the cheek, showing their closeness. I'm",
      "In January 2024, the NIS said it viewed Kim Ju Ae as her father's likely heir. Some outside experts disagree with that assessment, citing Kim Jong Un\u2019s relatively young age and the extremely male-dominated nature of North Korea\u2019s power hierarchy. The NIS told lawmakers in November that Kim appeared to have no major health problems.",
      "Revealing the young Kim Ju Ae was a surprise to foreign experts because neither Kim Jong Un nor Kim Jong Il were mentioned in North Korean state media before they became adults. Some observers say Kim Jong Un likely aimed to shore up public support for his plan to extend the family's rule by repeatedly disclosing Kim Ju Ae in public events.",

      "Safari Martins may be Kenya\u2019s most famous barber",
      "KIAMBU, Kenya -- Safari Martins leads his client Ian Njenga into a sparse shack on the rural roadside in Kiambu, at the edge of metropolitan Nairobi. On the shack\u2019s wooden walls hang a shovel, iron, agricultural shears and a wrench, but Njenga is not there to buy equipment. He's there to get a haircut.",
      "\u201cI just use unconventional tools,\u201d Martins says, smiling, moments before sliding a razor-sharp shovel edge across Njenga\u2019s head, lopping off a swath of hair in the first of a series of moves that yields a surprisingly clean haircut.",
      "Unconventional tools are a hallmark for Martins, who is one of Kenya\u2019s most recognizable barbers with around 1 million followers on each of his Instagram and TikTok accounts, where he is known as Chief Safro.",
      "As he makes precision cuts across Njenga\u2019s head, a helper stands to the side, capturing every moment from different angles on a smartphone camera.",
      "Influencer barbers are a new trend in Kenya, where social media usage has exploded in recent years and platforms like TikTok are being used both for entertainment and as a lucrative side hustle.",
      "Born in Rwanda and now based in Nairobi, Martins got his start barbering in high school in 2018. Using borrowed clippers, he began offering trims outside classrooms and in cramped dormitories. Five years later, he added a camera and dropped a conventional trimmer \u2014 and never turned back.",
      "Martins went viral for zany barbering methods, but he has increasingly incorporated traditional African folk tales into voiceovers on his videos.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m motivated by African culture, by African stories,\u201d he says, adding that one of his tools, a sharpened iron box, was blessed by village elders.",
      "The barber\u2019s staying power has come from the haircuts themselves, which his customers say they love\u2014and the chance to be featured on one of Kenya\u2019s most magnetic social media accounts.",

      "The draw of a unique barbering experience and five minutes of social media fame is enough for customers to push past the price. Martins charges up to 1500 Kenyan shillings, or almost $12, for one of his cuts, a hefty premium in Nairobi, where men may pay a tenth of that for a trim.",
      "The popularity of Martins and other content creator barbers has come amid the breakneck growth of social media in Kenya. In January 2023, there were just 10.6 million social media users in the country, according to DataReportal, a market research group. By January 2025, that number had increased almost 50%, to 15.1 million.",
      "With monetization of social media content often benchmarked to Western digital advertising rates, finding success online can also bring a relative windfall to Kenyans. Around 15% of Kenyans engaged in online content creation rely on it as their primary source of income, the Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis, a think tank, said in a June 2025 brief.",
      "Nevertheless, Martins complains that barbers do not not reap the same rewards as other content creators, and he is right. Some of the highest-paid creators are those who make gaming, education, or lifestyle content, according to Fundmates, a company that finances influencers, because of the wide applicability of brand deals in these niches.",
      "\u201cBarbers get viral on social media but I feel like they are not respected,\u201d says Martins. \u201cYou are not paid as a content creator, even though you have the views, even if you have the engagement.\u201d",

      "Membership means Bulgaria is part of a much larger economic entity \u2014 the eurozone, with its internationally used currency and central bank that sets interest rates across the currency union.",
      "A single currency means that, for example, Bulgarians can vacation in neighboring EU and eurozone member Greece and not have to exchange money or come back with leftover bills and coins they can't spend at home.

      "Scientists from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University have created the first three-dimensional image of the Popocat\u00e9petl volcano's interior",
      "POPOCAT\u00c9PETL VOLCANO, Mexico -- In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocat\u00e9petl volcano, one of the world\u2019s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.",
      "For five years, the group from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano\u2019s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.",
      "Marco Cal\u00f2, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute\u2019s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.",
      "Inside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocat\u00e9petl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.",
      "Other scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see \u201chow the volcanic edifice was being built,\u201d and above all, where the magma gathered, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "His team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.",
      "The devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.",
      "\u201cI taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo\u201d and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.",
      "Little by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.",
      "The result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.",
      "This first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.",
      "Popocat\u00e9petl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.",
      "Cal\u00f2, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.",
      "He explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocat\u00e9petl, in the first century, had its own \u201clittle Pompeii\u201d when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions \u2014 using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater \u2014 that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.",
      "For years Cal\u00f2 studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to \u201cunderstand how something works without touching it\u201d spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.",
      "That changed with Popocat\u00e9petl, a volcano he describes as \u201cmajestic.\u201d",

      "The release was stipulated in the ceasefire agreement, signed Saturday by the defense ministers of the two countries at the same border checkpoint between Thailand\u2019s Chanthaburi province and Cambodia's Pailin province where the soldiers were released.",
      "\u201cThe repatriation of the 18 Cambodian soldiers was undertaken as a demonstration of goodwill and confidence-building, as well as in adherence to international humanitarian principles,\u201d Thailand\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.",

The prisoners were allowed visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross and other rights covered under international humanitarian law, Thai authorities said.",
      "Their continued detention was used effectively by Cambodia\u2019s government to rally nationalist sentiment in the conflict against Thailand.",

      "The former prisoners were flown in the afternoon from western Cambodia to the capital, Phnom Penh, where they were greeted with hugs and visible emotion by their families as they stepped off a helicopter at the city's old airport.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Donald Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one\u2019s efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don\u2019t get their health insurance from an employer and don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters\u2019 concerns.",
      "\u201cIt really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\u201d said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly disappointed that there hasn\u2019t been more action.\u201d",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It\u2019s a strain for the 49-year-old but one he\u2019s willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",

      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she\u2019ll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her four-year-old daughter. She can\u2019t afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it\u2019s unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",

Nonprofit partners include Girl Scouts of the USA, which will offer a volunteering badge to any of its roughly 1 million youth members who complete a service project, and Keep America Beautiful, which is leading efforts to clean up 250 million pieces of trash by the Fourth of July.

      "\u201cWe strongly believe that this is as much about the future as it is the past,\" said America250 Chair Rosie Rios, who oversees the nonpartisan commission created by Congress to organize the anniversary. \u201cEspecially this next generation, we want them to give them something to believe in.\u201d",
      "That forward-focused goal requires courting a demographic that many nonprofits struggle to reach: young volunteers.",
      "About one-quarter of adults under 30 said they volunteered their time to charity or provided non-financial support to people in their community in the past year, according to a March AP-NORC poll, compared with 36% of those over 60.",
      "Rios said America Gives is working with high schools, many of which already list community service as a graduation requirement, to ensure those volunteering hours are logged and build giving habits that continue after students' secondary education.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very passionate. They\u2019re very purpose driven. They do want to give back,\" Rios said, adding that \u201cinspiring them to not just visualize, but maybe fuel their own future, is a big priority for us.\u201d",
      "Service could be an opportunity to meet younger generations\u2019 desire for in-person connections. Sofia Alvarez \u2014 a cohort lead for the Youth250 Bureau, a separate effort to center Gen Z perspectives throughout next year\u2019s programming \u2014 said young people want \u201cthird spaces.\u201d That means somewhere outside of home, school or work that feels \u201csafe,\u201d she said, but doesn\u2019t require spending money.",
      "\u201cI think any sort of craft or activity that really helps people connect, where they can chit chat and bond with each other, really builds that sense of community,\u201d Alvarez said.",
      "Sarah Keating, vice president of Girl and Volunteer Experience at Girl Scouts of the USA, said they\u2019ve had to make their volunteer opportunities more manageable.",
      "Young people want to give back, Keating said, but they are busy and don\u2019t know how. She said nonprofits must offer experiences \u201cthat match their lives.\u201d Someone might not have time to lead an entire troop, for example, but they can help lead a specific badge program.",

      "HONG KONG -- State-backed property developer China Vanke, once the country\u2019s largest homebuilder by sales, narrowly avoided defaulting on a 2 billion yuan ($284 million) bond last week as the painfully slow recovery in China\u2019s property market drags on.",
      "The Chinese developer also was seeking to delay repayment of another 3.7 billion yuan ($530 million) of onshore debt due on Dec. 28, with bondholders agreeing to extend the deadline to February.",
      "Years after the downturn in the housing market began, Chinese developers are still struggling to regain their footing, despite a slew of government policies meant to revive the industry. Weak investment and housing prices have shaken investor confidence, spilling into the broader economy since millions of homeowners are stuck with apartments worth far less than what they paid for them.",
      "Instead of the huge driver of prosperity that it once was, the property market is weighing on the economy.",
      "Although Vanke's bondholders have approved extensions for repayments of its debt, the risk of a default remains.",
      "About a third-owned by Shenzhen Metro, a state-owned railway, publicly listed Vanke's finances are a mess. Its revenue fell 27% from a year earlier in the latest July-September quarter, and several of its onshore bonds were suspended from trading after prices plunged.",
      "The developer owes more than $50 billion, less than the more than $300 billion in debt racked up by China Evergrande, one of the first property dominos to fall when it defaulted in 2021 after the government cracked down on excessive borrowing in the industry.",
      "Analysts say Vanke, founded in the 1980s in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, may be testing the limits of state support for property developers in reviving the industry, which once accounted for more than a quarter of total economic activities in China.",
      "More than four years after the downturn began, China\u2019s property sector has yet to recover. The situation varies from city to city, but overall home prices have fallen by 20% or more from their peak in 2021.",
      "The decline has continued, with new home sales falling 11.2% by value year-on-year in the first 11 months of 2025, according to official statistics. Property investments fell nearly 16% from a year earlier.",
      "The slump has caused massive layoffs, hurting overall consumer confidence and spending.",
      "\u201cThe continued slide in the property market remains one of the most significant risks to China\u2019s efforts to shift to a domestically demand-driven growth model,\u201d wrote Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank, in a recent commentary.",

      "While Vanke's debt is way smaller than Evergrande\u2019s was, a default would sting: It had been considered one of the financially sounder real estate developers in China.",
      "Shenzhen Metro Group, which is controlled by the Shenzhen government, has provided more than 29 billion yuan ($4 billion) in shareholder loans to Vanke so far this year to help with its debt repayments, according to S&P Global.",
      "That's not enough to repay its full obligations. Vanke reported 60 billion yuan ($8 billion) of cash by the end of September 2025, against short-term debts of about 151 billion yuan ($21 billion), Fitch Ratings said.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most significant, quasi state-backed developers that may be defaulting (on) their repayment,\u201d said Foreky Wong, a founding partner at Fortune Ark Restructuring.",
      "S&P Global, one of the world's main rating agencies, recently downgraded Vanke to \u201cselective default,\" saying it viewed the extension of its bond repayment period as a distressed debt restructuring \u201ctantamount to a default.\" Fitch Ratings also downgraded Vanke\u2019s rating to \u201crestricted default\u201d.",

      "President Donald Trump made a lot of tariff threats and trade promises this year. Many materialized into a barrage of new import taxes that overturned decades of U.S. economic policy \u2014 but others have yet to be fulfilled as 2025 comes to a close.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s unrealized threats reflect a broader approach from a president with a track record of using sky-high levies to pressure other countries into new trade deals, one-up retaliatory measures or even punish political critics. At the same time, they arrived as growing list of tariffs did go into effect \u2014 from Trump's punishing new taxes on imported metals, to tit-for-tat levies with top U.S. trading partners like China \u2014 plunging consumers and businesses worldwide into uncertainty.",
      "Here\u2019s what Trump said when announcing some of his biggest (but still unrealized) tariff threats and promises this year, and where things stand today.",
      "In his words:",
      "1. Trump in a Jan. 14 social media post: \u201cFor far too long, we have relied on taxing our Great People using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ... We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share. January 20, 2025, will be the birth date of the External Revenue Service.\u201d2.

      "What happened: The EU's planned levy on American whiskey \u2014 which it unveiled as part of broader retaliation in response to Trump's new steel and aluminum tariffs \u2014 was postponed, with the latest delay reportedly running until at least February.",
      "Trump's 200% tariff threat on European alcohol never materialized. But spirits were not included in the EU-U.S. trade deal struck over the summer, which set a 15% rate on most European imports.",

      "What happened: The president did not sign an executive order imposing a 100% tariff on pharma products on Oct. 1 and, as of today, no levy has been put into place. But Trump previously suggested that steep levies on pharmaceutical drugs could arrive further down the road, telling CNBC in August that he would start by charging a \u201csmall tariff\u201d and potentially raise the rate as high as 250%. Meanwhile, trade agreements with specific countries set their own rates or exemptions \u2014 with the U.K., for example, securing a 0% tariff on all British medicine exported to the U.S. for three years. The administration also announced deals with specific companies with promises of lower drug prices.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Greg Abel faces the challenge of taking over Berkshire Hathaway from the legendary Warren Buffettthis week.",
      "Many regard Buffett as the world's greatest investor after he grew Berkshire from a struggling New England textile mill that he starting buying up for $7.60 a share in 1962, to the massive conglomerate it is today with shares that go for more than $750,000 a pop. Buffett's personal fortune of Berkshire stock is worth roughly $150 billion even after giving more than $60 billion away over the past 20 years.",
      "Berkshire for decades has routinely outpaced the S&P 500 as Buffett bought up insurance companies like Geico and National Indemnity, manufacturers like Iscar Metalworking, retail brands like Dairy Queen, major utilities and even one of the nation's biggest railroads, BNSF. Along the way, Buffett bought and sold hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks and profited handsomely from his famously long-term bets on companies like American Express, Coca-Cola and Apple.",
      "Berkshire has struggled to keep that pace in recent years because it has grown so huge and also struggled to find new and significant acquisitions. Even this fall's $9.7 billion acquisition of OxyChem probably isn't big enough to make a difference in Berkshire's profits.",
      "Investors will be watching closely to see what changes Abel might make in Berkshire's trajectory, but don't expect any seismic shifts.",
      "Buffett isn't going anywhere and Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments and offer Abel any advice he asks for.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it is natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "But Berkshire operates under an extremely decentralized structure that trusts its executives with significant decisions. Everyone associated with the company has said there are no plans to change that.",
      "The world learned that Abel was to become the designated successor at Berkshire in 2021 when Buffett\u2019s longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, assured shareholders at an annual meeting that Abel would maintain the company\u2019s culture.",
      "Part of Buffett\u2019s sales pitch to company founders and CEOs thinking of selling their companies has always been that Berkshire would largely allow them to continue running their companies the same way as long as they delivered results.",
      "\u201cI think the investment community would likely applaud Greg\u2019s management style to the degree that it sort of buttons things up,\" Seifert said. \"And if it helps performance, that can\u2019t really be faulted.\u201d",

      "Abel has already shown himself to be a more hands-on manager than Buffett, but he still follows the Berkshire model of autonomy for acquired companies. Abel asks tough questions of company leaders and holds them accountable for their performance.",
      "Abel did announce some leadership changes earlier this month after investment manager and Geico CEO Todd Combs departed, and Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg announced his retirement. Abel also said he's appointing NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses. That essentially creates a third division of the company and takes some work off of Abel's plate. He will continue to manage the manufacturing, utility and railroad businesses.",
      "Abel will eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. From the beginning, Berkshire has held the position that it is better to reinvest profits rather than making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "But if Abel can\u2019t find a productive use of the $382 billion cash that Berkshire is sitting on, there may be a push from investors to start paying dividends or to adopt a traditional stock buyback program that would boost the value of shares they hold. Currently, Berkshire only repurchases shares when Buffett thinks they are a bargain, and he hasn't done that since early 2024.",
      "Still, Abel will be insulated from such pressure for some time since Buffett controls nearly 30% of the voting power in the stock. That will diminish gradually after his death as his children distribute his shares to charity as agreed.",
      "Many of Berkshire's subsidiaries tend to follow the economy and profit handsomely whenever the country is prosperous. Berkshire's utilities typically generate a reliable profit, and its insurance companies like Geico and General Reinsurance supply more than $175 billion worth of premiums that can be invested until claims come due.",
      "Investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said most of Berkshire's businesses \u201ccan almost take care of themselves.\" He sees a bright future for Berkshire under Abel.",
      "One of the biggest questions right now may be how much additional change there will be in company leadership after Combs' departure, if any at all. The head of the insurance unit, Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who Buffett has long lavished with praise, is now 74 and many of the CEOs of the various companies have continued working long after retirement age because they like working for Buffett.",
      "\u201cAs a long-term shareholder, we aren\u2019t too concerned with Todd\u2019s departure and don\u2019t think this is the tip of some sort of iceberg,\" said Ballard, whose firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. \"Todd\u2019s situation is unique. It\u2019s just a reminder that Warren\u2019s pending departure is imminent and they\u2019re preparing for a new phase \u2014 one that we\u2019re still excited to see unfold.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Wednesday for how much aid per acre farmers can plan on for each row crop. The details arrived after most farmers have already met with their bankers to arrange financing for next year's crops and placed orders for the seed and fertilizer they will need. But officials have promised that the payments should arrive by the end of February.",
      "Soybean farmers have been hit especially hard by Trump's trade war with China, which stopped buying any American crops after Trump announced his tariffs this spring. China is the world's largest buyer of soybeans. This aid package is expected to help farmers weather the trade disruptions until China buys more soybeans under an agreement announced in October and until provisions of Trump's massive budget bill take effect later this year.",
      "Soybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.",
      "But farmers say the aid won't solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now. Some agricultural trade groups have said they worry that thousands of farmers could go out of business, but others have said they believe most farmers have the financial resources and equity needed to survive.",

      "After Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the White House said Beijing had promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the calendar year, plus 25 million metric tons a year in each of the next three years. Officials have said China is on track to meet the 12 million metric ton goal by the end of February, but so far China has only purchased about 4.3 million metric tons of soybeans, according to the latest USDA figures.",
      "Beijing has yet to confirm any commitment to buying 12 million metric tons of soybeans for this season, but the Chinese embassy in Washington said earlier this month that \u201cagricultural trade cooperation between China and the United States is proceeding in an orderly manner.\u201d",
      "The aid payments will be capped at $155,000 per farmer or entity, and only farms that make less than $900,000 in adjusted gross income will be eligible. During the first Trump administration, a number of large farms found ways around the payment limits and collected millions.",
      "The USDA said it would use a formula that estimates production costs to come up with a per-acre payment for each type of crop. The USDA says the average size of the 1.88 million farms nationwide was 466 acres last year, but many farmers are much larger than that as larger operations have continued to buy up neighboring farms over time.",

      "By most measures, 2025 was a rough year for those who care about freedom of the press",
      "NEW YORK -- By nearly any measure, 2025 has been a rough year for anyone concerned about freedom of the press.",
      "It's likely to be the deadliest year on record for journalists and media workers. The number of assaults on reporters in the U.S. nearly equals the last three years combined. The president of the United States berates many who ask him questions, calling one woman \u201cpiggy.\u201d And the ranks of those doing the job continues to thin.",
      "It's hard to think of a darker time for journalists. So say many, including Tim Richardson, a former Washington Post reporter and now program director for journalism and disinformation at PEN America. \u201cIt's safe to say this assault on the press over the past year has probably been the most aggressive that we've seen in modern times.\u201d",
      "Worldwide, the 126 media industry people killed in 2025 by early December matched the number of deaths in all of 2024, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and last year was a record-setter. Israel's bombing of Gaza accounted for 85 of those deaths, 82 of them Palestinians.",
      "\u201cIt's extremely concerning,\u201d said Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists. \u201cUnfortunately, it's not just, of course, about the sheer numbers of journalists and media workers killed, it's also about the failure to obtain justice or get accountability for those killings.",
      "\u201cWhat we know from decades of doing this work is that impunity breeds impunity,\u201d she said. \u201cSo a failure to tackle journalists' killings creates an environment where those killings continue.\u201d",
      "The committee estimates there are at least 323 journalists imprisoned worldwide.",
      "None of those killed this year were from the United States. But the work on American soil has still been dangerous. There have been 170 reports of assaults on journalists in the United States this year, 160 of them at the hands of law enforcement, according to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. Many of those reports came from coverage of immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "It's impossible to look past the influence of President Donald Trump, who frequently seethes with anger at the press while simultaneously interacting with journalists more than any president in memory \u2014 frequently answering their cellphone calls.",
      "\u201cTrump has always attacked the press,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut during the second term, he's turned that into government action to restrict and punish and intimidate journalists.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press learned that quickly, when Trump limited the outlet's access to cover him after it refused to follow his lead to rename the Gulf of Mexico. It launched a court fight that has remained unresolved. Trump has also extracted settlements from ABC and CBS News in lawsuits over stories that displeased him, and is suing The New York Times and Wall Street Journal.",
      "Long angry about a perceived bias against conservatives on PBS and NPR newscasts, Trump and his allies in Congress successfully cut funding for public broadcasting as a whole. The president has also moved to shut down government-run organizations that beam news to all parts of the world.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is a major investor in media development, in independent media outlets in countries that have little or no independent media, or as a source of information for people in countries where there is no free media,\u201d Ginsberg said. \u201cThe evisceration of Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America is another blow to press freedom globally.\u201d",
      "Others in his administration take Trump's lead, like when his press office chose the day after Thanksgiving to launch a web portal to complain about outlets or journalists being unfair.",

      "Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has portrayed journalists as dark figures skulking around Pentagon halls to uncover classified secrets as his rationale for putting in restrictive rules for coverage.",
      "That's led to the most notable example of journalists fighting back: most mainstream news outlets gave up their credentials to work in the Pentagon rather than agree to these rules, and are still breaking stories while working off-site. The New York Times has sued to overturn the rules. The newspaper also publicly defends itself when attacked by the president, such as when he complained about its coverage of his health.",
      "Despite the more organized effort against the press, the public has taken little notice. The Pew Research Center said that 36% of Americans reported earlier this year hearing about the Trump administration's relationship with the press, compared to 72% who said that at the same point in his first term.",
      "Polls consistently show that journalists have never been popular, and are likely to elicit little sympathy when their work becomes harder.",
      "\u201cReally, the harm falls on the public with so much of this because the public depends on this independent reporting to understand and scrutinize the decisions that are being made by the most powerful office in the world,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "The news industry as a whole is more than two decades in to a retrenchment caused largely by a collapse in the advertising market, and every year brings more reports of journalists laid off as a result. One of the year's most sobering statistics came in a report by the organizations Muck Rack and Rebuild Local News: in 2002, there were 40 journalists for every 100,000 people in the United States and by this year, it was down to just over eight.",
      "Asked if they could find reasons for optimism, both Ginsberg and Richardson pointed to the rise of some independent local news organizations, shoots of growth in a barren landscape, places like the Baltimore Banner, Charlottesville Tomorrow in Virginia and Outlier Media in Michigan.",
      "As much as they are derided in Trump's America, influential Axios CEO Jim VandeHei noted in a column recently that reporters at mainstream media outlets are still working hard and able to set the nation's agenda with their reporting.",
      "As he told the AP: \u201cOver time, people will hopefully come to their senses and say, 'Hey, the media like anything else is imperfect but, man, it's a nice thing to have a free press.'\u201d",

      "The strip followed her carefree breeze through life with her boyfriend, Dagwood Bumstead. The two would marry (and she would change her name) in 1933, and the strip would become the sandwich-heavy domestic comedy familiar to later readers. Though the strip was meant to be based on a woman's life, Dagwood would in many ways become its breakout star \u2014 a proto- Adam Driver, if you will, as the breakout actor from \u201cGirls.\u201d",

      "POPOCAT\u00c9PETL VOLCANO, Mexico -- In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocat\u00e9petl volcano, one of the world\u2019s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.",
      "For five years, the group from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano\u2019s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.",
      "Marco Cal\u00f2, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute\u2019s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.",
      "Inside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocat\u00e9petl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.",
      "Other scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see \u201chow the volcanic edifice was being built,\u201d and above all, where the magma gathered, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "His team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.",
      "The devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.",
      "\u201cI taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo\u201d and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.",
      "Little by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.",
      "The result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.",
      "This first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.",
      "Popocat\u00e9petl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.",
      "Cal\u00f2, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.",
      "He explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocat\u00e9petl, in the first century, had its own \u201clittle Pompeii\u201d when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions \u2014 using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater \u2014 that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.",
      "For years Cal\u00f2 studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to \u201cunderstand how something works without touching it\u201d spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.",

      "Altayli, 63, a longtime columnist whose YouTube programs drew hundreds of thousands of viewers daily, was sentenced last month to four years and two months in prison. He had been arrested in June on charges of threatening the president during one of his broadcasts \u2014 a case critics described as an attempt to silence a prominent government opponent.",

      "Altayli\u2019s arrest stemmed from remarks on his program \u201cFatih Altayli Comments,\u201d in which he discussed a survey showing more than 70% of the public opposed a lifetime presidency for Erdogan, who has ruled for over two decades.

      "KISKUNMAJSA, Hungary -- Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti climbed to the bottom of a sandy pit on his land on the Great Hungarian Plain and dug into the soil with his hand, looking for a sign of groundwater that in recent years has been in accelerating retreat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s much worse, and it\u2019s getting worse year after year,\u201d he said as cloudy liquid slowly seeped into the hole. \u201dWhere did so much water go? It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Nagyap\u00e1ti has watched with distress as the region in southern Hungary, once an important site for agriculture, has become increasingly parched and dry. Where a variety of crops and grasses once filled the fields, today there are wide cracks in the soil and growing sand dunes more reminiscent of the Sahara Desert than Central Europe.",
      "The region, known as the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g, has been described by some studies as semiarid \u2014 a distinction more common in parts of Africa, the American Southwest or Australian Outback \u2014 and is characterized by very little rain, dried-out wells and a water table plunging ever deeper underground.",
      "In a 2017 paper in European Countryside, a scientific journal, researchers cited \u201cthe combined effect of climatic changes, improper land use and inappropriate environmental management\u201d as causes for the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g's aridification, a phenomenon the paper called unique in this part of the continent.",
      "Fields that in previous centuries would be regularly flooded by the Danube and Tisza Rivers have, through a combination of climate change-related droughts and poor water retention practices, become nearly unsuitable for crops and wildlife.",
      "Now a group of farmers and other volunteers, led by Nagyap\u00e1ti, are trying to save the region and their lands from total desiccation using a resource for which Hungary is famous: thermal water.",
      "\u201cI was thinking about what could be done, how could we bring the water back or somehow create water in the landscape,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti told The Associated Press. \"There was a point when I felt that enough is enough. We really have to put an end to this. And that's where we started our project to flood some areas to keep the water in the plain.\u201d",
      "Along with the group of volunteer \u201cwater guardians,\u201d Nagyap\u00e1ti began negotiating with authorities and a local thermal spa last year, hoping to redirect the spa's overflow water \u2014 which would usually pour unused into a canal \u2014 onto their lands. The thermal water is drawn from very deep underground.",
      "According to the water guardians' plan, the water, cooled and purified, would be used to flood a 2\u00bd-hectare (6-acre) low-lying field \u2014 a way of mimicking the natural cycle of flooding that channelizing the rivers had ended.",
      "\u201cWhen the flooding is complete and the water recedes, there will be 2\u00bd hectares of water surface in this area,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"This will be quite a shocking sight in our dry region.\u201d",
      "A 2024 study by Hungary\u2019s E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University showed that unusually dry layers of surface-level air in the region had prevented any arriving storm fronts from producing precipitation. Instead, the fronts would pass through without rain, and result in high winds that dried out the topsoil even further.",
      "The water guardians hoped that by artificially flooding certain areas, they wouldn't only raise the groundwater level but also create a microclimate through surface evaporation that could increase humidity, reduce temperatures and dust and have a positive impact on nearby vegetation.",

      "Tam\u00e1s T\u00f3th, a meteorologist in Hungary, said that because of the potential impact such wetlands can have on the surrounding climate, water retention \u201cis simply the key issue in the coming years and for generations to come, because climate change does not seem to stop.\u201d",
      "\"The atmosphere continues to warm up, and with it the distribution of precipitation, both seasonal and annual, has become very hectic, and is expected to become even more hectic in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "Following another hot, dry summer this year, the water guardians blocked a series of sluices along a canal, and the repurposed water from the spa began slowly gathering in the low-lying field.",
      "After a couple of months, the field had nearly been filled. Standing beside the area in early December, Nagyap\u00e1ti said that the shallow marsh that had formed \"may seem very small to look at it, but it brings us immense happiness here in the desert.\u201d",
      "He said the added water will have a \u201chuge impact\u201d within a roughly 4-kilometer (2\u00bd-mile) radius, \"not only on the vegetation, but also on the water balance of the soil. We hope that the groundwater level will also rise.\u201d",
      "Persistent droughts in the Great Hungarian Plain have threatened desertification, a process where vegetation recedes because of high heat and low rainfall. Weather-damaged crops have dealt significant blows to the country\u2019s overall gross domestic product, prompting Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to announce this year the creation of a \u201cdrought task force\u201d to deal with the problem.",
      "After the water guardians' first attempt to mitigate the growing problem in their area, they said they experienced noticeable improvements in the groundwater level, as well as an increase of flora and fauna near the flood site.",
      "The group, which has grown to more than 30 volunteers, would like to expand the project to include another flooded field, and hopes their efforts could inspire similar action by others to conserve the most precious resource.",
      "\u201cThis initiative can serve as an example for everyone, we need more and more efforts like this,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"We retained water from the spa, but retaining any kind of water, whether in a village or a town, is a tremendous opportunity for water replenishment.\u201d",

      "Federal ruling blocks Hawaii's climate change tourist tax on cruise ships",
      "HONOLULU -- A federal appeals court ruling on New Year's Eve blocked Hawaii from enforcing a climate change tourist tax on cruise ships passengers, a levy that was set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, arguing that the new law violates the U.S. Constitution by taxing cruise ships for entering Hawaii ports. They also argued it would make cruises more expensive. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship\u2019s passenger, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "In the nation\u2019s first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax would generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake last week upheld the law and the plaintiffs appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. government intervened in the case and also appealed Otake's ruling.",
      "The order by two 9th Circuit judges granted both requests for an injunction pending the appeals.",

      "Those are among the top 10 words on the 50th annual \u201cBanished Words List,\u201d released Thursday by Lake Superior State University. The tongue-in-cheek roundup of overused slang started in 1976 as a New Year\u2019s Eve party idea, and is affectionately called the list of \u201cQueen\u2019s English for Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness.\u201d",

      "Few phrases in 2025 befuddled parents, teachers and others over the age of, say 40, more than \u201c6-7.\u201d Dictionary.com even picked it as their 2025 word of the year, while other dictionaries chose words like \u201cslop\u201d and \u201c rage bait.\u201d",
      "But what does \u201c6-7\u201d actually mean? It exploded over the summer, especially among Gen Z, and is considered by many to be nonsensical in meaning \u2014 an inside joke driven by social media.",

      "The placement of \u201c6-7\u201d at the top of the banished list puts it in good company. In 2019, the centuries-old Latin phrase \u201cquid pro quo\" was the top requested phrase to ban from popular use. In 2017, \" fake news \" got the most votes.",

      "It's said in some cultures that eating fruit on New Year's Eve brings luck and wealth. Perhaps that's why many cities mix fruit into their celebrations. Miami has its \u201cBig Orange\u201d drop, while Sarasota, Florida, features a pineapple. There are cherry drops in Milwaukie, Oregon, and Traverse City, Michigan. Brightly lit grapes plunge from above in Temecula, California. Atlanta this year is replacing its peach drop with a \u201cdigital drone peach in the sky.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s tough to beat ringing in the year while watching a pair of sparkly flip-flops diving into Folly Beach, South Carolina. In Panama City Beach, Florida, there\u2019s an evening-long bash where 15,000 beach balls are dropped above revelers just hours before a giant beach ball descends a tower at midnight.",

      "Waterfront cities celebrate the sea on New Year's Eve. Brunswick, Georgia, has the shrimp drop, while Easton, Maryland, serves up its annual crab drop. The oyster drop is the main event in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The biggest catch might be in Port Clinton, Ohio, along Lake Erie, home to a 600-pound (272-kilogram) walleye named Wylie. The original papier-mache version debuted 30 years ago and has given way to a menacing fiberglass fish.",
      "There's definitely a food theme to these New Year's drops. Just outside Chicago, watch out for a 10-foot (3 meters) pierogi in Whiting, Indiana. The Idaho Potato Drop in Boise has been going for more than a decade, and Mt. Olive, North Carolina, celebrates its hometown pickle brand by dropping a glittery green pickle that's close to 6 feet (1.8 meters) long.",
      "All of these events are meant to be fun, boost civic pride and attract tourists. But one created such a stir that it ended up in court. Residents in western North Carolina no longer lower a live possum inside a glass box at midnight, calling off the event in 2019 after years of protests and legal challenges. There is still a possum drop in Tallapoosa, Georgia, which was long ago known as Possum Snout. That one, though, stars a stuffed possum named Spencer.",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Fifty-two bears were killed during Florida's first black bear hunt in a decade, state wildlife officials said Tuesday.",
      "The bear hunt, which started Dec. 6 and ended on Sunday, had been restricted to 172 permit holders who had won their vouchers through a random lottery involving more than 160,000 applicants.",
      "At least four dozen of the permits went to opponents of the hunt who never intended to use them, according to the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, which encouraged critics to apply in the hopes of saving bears. Each permit holder was allowed to kill one bear as part of the state's wildlife management strategy.",
      "The Florida black bear population is considered one of the state\u2019s conservation success stories, having grown from just several hundred bears in the 1970s to an estimate over 4,000. Opponents had questioned whether the hunt was necessary, but they were unable to convince the courts to halt it.",
      "\u201cThe 2025 black bear hunt, rooted in sound scientific data, was a success,\" Roger Young, executive director of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said in a statement.",
      "The kill count may have been lower than expected for a range of reasons, including the possibilities that the state overestimated the population or conservationists managed to take up enough permits to make a difference, said Susannah Randolph, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Florida chapter.",
      "The lack of transparency by state officials about the number raised questions about whether it was accurate since there were no check-in stations for hunters like in 2015, and hunters self-reported their kills via the commission's hunting app, Randolph said.",

      "This year\u2019s hunting plan had more stringent rules than the 2015 hunt, in which permits were provided to anyone who could pay for them, resulting in more than 3,700 permits issued. That led to a chaotic event that was shut down days early. Of the 304 bears killed, at least 38 were females with cubs, meaning the young bears may have died too.",

      "Smallwood had health issues for many years, and music gave him the strength to endure, Carpenter said in an interview.",
      "\u201cRichard was so dedicated to music, and that was the thing that kept him alive all these years,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking music that made people feel something is what made him want to keep breathing and keep moving and keep living.\u201d",
      "Smallwood's songs were performed and recorded over the years by artists such as Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Destiny's Child and Boyz II Men.",

      "\u201cHis music didn\u2019t just inspire me, it transformed me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is my favorite pianist, and his brilliance, spirit, and devotion to the music have shaped generations, including my own journey.\u201d",
      "Smallwood was born Nov. 30, 1948, in Atlanta and began to play piano by ear by the age of 5, according to biographic materials provided by Carpenter. By age 7, he was taking formal lessons. He had formed his own gospel group by the time he was 11.",
      "He was primarily raised in Washington, D.C., by his mother, Mabel, and his stepfather, the Rev. Chester Lee \u201cC.L.\u201d Smallwood. His stepfather was the pastor of Union Temple Baptist Church in Washington.",

He was a member of Howard's first gospel group, the Celestials. He was also a founding member of the university's gospel choir, according to an obituary from Carpenter.",
      "After college, Smallwood taught music at the University of Maryland and went on to form the Richard Smallwood Singers in 1977, bringing a contemporary sound to traditional gospel music. He later formed Vision, a large choir that fueled some of his biggest gospel hits, including \u201cTotal Praise.\u201d",
      "\u201cTotal Praise\u201d became a modern-day hymn that touched people from all types of backgrounds and walks of life, Carpenter said by phone Wednesday.",

If he never wrote anything else, that would have put him in the modern hymn book.\u201d",
      "In recent years, mild dementia and other health issues prevented Smallwood from recording music, and members of his Vision choir helped care for him.",
      "His legacy will live on \u201cthrough every note and every soul he touched,\u201d Khan said.",

      "The rampage, in which a man drove around a police blockade in the early hours of Jan. 1, revealed security vulnerabilities surrounding the city's famous street filled with boisterous bars, brass bands playing on cobblestone corners and a steady stream of partygoers carrying cocktails.",
      "While Louisiana officials say the popular tourist destination is safe and that they've implemented additional measures to crack down on potential threats, families of deceased victims say not enough has been done to prevent similar tragedies.",
      "The attack happened when Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a pickup truck down Bourbon Street, plowing into crowds celebrating New Year\u2019s Day, killing 14 people and injuring dozens of others. Police shot and killed Jabbar, a U.S. citizen and Army veteran who had proclaimed his support for the Islamic State militant group on social media.",
      "In the wake of the rampage, city officials, state agencies and law firms representing victims\u2019 families launched investigations into whether the attack could have been prevented. The investigations focused on the street's bollard system of steel columns designed to block cars from entering the thoroughfare. The bollards were being replaced at the time.",
      "Among the victims were Nikyra Dedeaux, an 18-year-old about to start college who was on Bourbon Street with friends. Her mother, Melissa Dedeaux, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that while many will ring in 2026 with fireworks and merriment, she will be grieving. She has been haunted by her daughter's final moments, captured in graphic video that circulated on social media.",

      "\u201cThey are not meant to be utilized in the fashion they are,\u201d Samuel Palumbo, the 8th District New Orleans Police Department Captain, said of the barriers that can withstand only low-speed collisions. He stressed to the New Orleans Governmental Affairs Committee this month that the system is a \u201ctemporary solution to a permanent problem.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to learn from what happened,\u201d Morris Bart, whose law firm is representing victims and their families, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of ridiculous ... that a year after this tragedy nothing has been done to resolve this situation.\u201d",
      "Palumbo urged the city to install permanent security gates that can withstand crashes up to 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour). The committee opted to hold off on a vote until incoming Mayor Helena Moreno enters office in January.",
      "A consulting firm, hired by the city to conduct a security assessment, made another suggestion: Make Bourbon Street a pedestrian only area.",

      "Faith leaders across the United States face challenges as they support anxious immigrants",
      "For faith leaders supporting and ministering to anxious immigrants across the United States, 2025 was fraught with challenges and setbacks. For many in these religious circles, the coming year could be worse.",
      "The essence of their fears: President Donald Trump has become harsher with his contemptuous rhetoric and policy proposals, blaming immigrants for problems from crime to housing shortages and, in a social media post, demanding \u201cREVERSE MIGRATION.\u201d",
      "Haitians who fled gang violence in their homeland, as well as Afghans allowed entry after assisting the U.S. in Afghanistan before the Taliban takeover, now fear that their refuge in America may end due to get-tough policy changes. Somali Americans, notably in Minnesota's Twin Cities, worry about their future after Trump referred to them as \u201cgarbage.\u201d",
      "After Trump's slurs, the chair of the Catholic bishops conference's subcommittee on racial justice urged public officials to refrain from dehumanizing language.",
      "\u201cEach child of God has value and dignity,\u201d said the bishop of Austin, Texas, Daniel Garcia. \u201cLanguage that denigrates a person or community based on his or her ethnicity or country of origin is incompatible with this truth.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what lies ahead for these targeted immigrant communities, and the faith leaders supporting them.",
      "In 2024, Trump falsely accused Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, of eating their neighbors' cats and dogs. It worsened fears about anti-immigrant sentiment in the mostly white, blue-collar city of about 59,000, where more than 15,000 Haitians live and work.",
      "Thousands of them settled in Springfield in recent years under the Temporary Protected Status program.",
      "Their prospects now seem dire. The TPS program, allowing many Haitians to remain legally in Springfield and elsewhere, expires in early February.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an economic and humanitarian disaster,\u201d said the Rev. Carl Ruby, pastor of Central Christian Church \u2014 one of several Springfield churches supporting the Haitians.",
      "Ruby and Viles Dorsainvil, a leader of Springfield's Haitian community, traveled recently to Washington to seek help from members of Congress.",
      "\u201cEvery single legislator we\u2019ve talked to has said nothing is going to happen legislatively. Trump\u2019s rhetoric keeps getting harsher,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel like anything is going our way.\u201d",
      "Many Haitians fear for their lives if they return to their gang-plagued homeland.",
      "Faith communities have come together to support immigrants in the face of Trump's crackdown, Ruby said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s increasing our resolve to oppose this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are more and more churches in Springfield saying we will provide sanctuary. \u2026 We will do whatever it takes to protect our members.\u201d",
      "Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program on the first day of his second term. Halting the program and its federal funding affected hundreds of faith-based organizations assisting refugees.",
      "Among them was Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, which serves the region around Washington, D.C., and lost 68% of its budget this year. The organization laid off two-thirds of its staff, shrinking from nearly 300 employees to 100.",
      "Many of its employees and nearly two-thirds of its clients are Afghans. Many worked with the U.S. in Afghanistan and fled after the Taliban\u2019s takeover from a U.S.-backed government in 2021.",
      "The Trump administration announced new immigration restrictions after an Afghan national became the suspect in the Nov. 26 shooting of two National Guard members in Washington.",
      "\u201cIt shook up our team. It was awful,\u201d said Kristyn Peck, CEO of LSSNCA.",
      "Peck said there is increased fear among Afghans on her staff and a false public narrative that Afghan immigrants are a threat.",

      "In mid-December, imams and other leaders of Minnesota\u2019s Somali community established a task force to tackle the fallout from major fraud scandals, a surge in immigration enforcement, and Trump\u2019s contemptuous words toward the largest group of Somali refugees in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not minimizing the crime, but we\u2019re amplifying the successes,\u201d said imam Yusuf Abdulle.",
      "He directs the Islamic Association of North America, a network of more than three dozen mostly East African mosques. About half are in Minnesota, which, since the late 1990s, has been home to growing numbers of Somali refugees who are increasingly visible in local and U.S. politics.",
      "\u201cFor unfortunate things like fraud or youth violence, every immigrant community has been through tough times,\u201d Abdulle said. \u201cFor the number of years here, Somali is a very resilient, very successful community.\u201d",
      "Even though most Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens or lawfully present, Abdulle said, many deserted local businesses and mosques when immigration enforcement surged.",
      "The new task force includes more than two dozen faith and business leaders, as well as community organizers. Addressing their community's fears is the first challenge, followed by increased advocacy ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cEvery election year the rhetoric goes up. And so we want to push back against these hateful rhetorics, but also bring our community together,\u201d said community leader Abdullahi Farah.",
      "In mid-November, U.S. Catholic bishops voted overwhelmingly to issue a \u201cspecial message\u201d decrying developments causing fear and anxiety among immigrants. It marked the first time in 12 years that the bishops invoked this urgent way of speaking collectively.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care,\u201d said the message. \u201cWe oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people. We pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.\u201d",
      "The bishops thanked priests, nuns and lay Catholics accompanying and assisting immigrants.",
      "\u201cWe urge all people of goodwill to continue and expand such efforts,\u201d the message said.",
      "The presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Yehiel Curry, issued a similar pastoral message last month thanking ELCA congregations for supporting immigrants amid \u201caggressive and indiscriminate immigration enforcement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe racial profiling and harm to our immigrant neighbors show no signs of diminishing, so we will heed God\u2019s call to show up alongside these neighbors,\u201d Curry wrote.",

      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics.

    "story": [
      "Actor George Clooney and his wife Amal Clooney were\u00a0granted French citizenship\u00a0because \"they contribute, through their distinguished actions, to France's international influence and cultural outreach,\" the French government said Wednesday, defending their naturalization that was questioned by a junior French minister.",
      "The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the \"Ocean's\" series of heist movies, his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their twins Ella and Alexander were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.",
      "Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior minister at the Interior Ministry, expressed misgivings Wednesday that some of the Clooneys' new French compatriots may think that the star couple was granted special treatment. The actor speaks only what he himself says is \"horrible, horrible\" French.",
      "\"The message being sent is not good,\" Vedrenne said in an interview with broadcaster France Info. \"There is an issue of fairness that, in my eyes, is absolutely essential.\"",
      "President Trump piled on the criticism against the move, saying France was welcome to the two-time Academy Award winner, a long-time vocal critic of the U.S. leader.",
      "\"Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday.",
      "He added, \"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies. He wasn't a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The couple purchased an estate in France in 2021 and Clooney has said that it's their primary residence. Non-French residents of France have multiple possible routes to becoming naturalized. It wasn't clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the Clooneys were eligible for citizenship under a French law that allows for the naturalization of foreign nationals who contribute to France's international influence and economic well-being.",
      "It argued that France's cinema industry will benefit from the actor's clout as a global movie star and said that as a lawyer, Amal Clooney regularly works with academic institutions and international organizations in France.",
      "\"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community,\" it concluded, giving the actor's first name a French twist by adding the \"s\" at the end.",
      "The decision was also defended by Vedrenne's superior at the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, who said he signed the naturalization decree.",
      "\"It's a big chance for our country,\" he said.",
      "In recent media interviews, when he was promoting \"Jay Kelly,\" Clooney said that he is trying to teach himself French using a language-learning app. He said that his wife and children speak the language perfectly.",
      "\"They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face and I don't know,\" he joked, speaking to French\u00a0broadcaster Canal+.",
      "French media have reported that the Clooneys live part-time in their luxury 18th-century villa outside the town of Brignoles in southern France, where they can keep a lower profile and their children are protected from unauthorized photographs by French privacy laws.",
      "In an interview with Esquire in October, Clooney said: \"I was worried about raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood.\"",
      "\"I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids,\" he said. Growing up away from the spotlight in France, \"they have dinner with grown-ups and have to take their dishes in. They have a much better life.\"",

      "But she resented the limelight, blaming chronic depression and a suicide attempt on the constant media attention after the birth of her only child. When she divorced her second husband, Jacques Charrier, he won custody of their son.",
      "She made two dozen more films in the 1960s, including the Oscar-nominated \"La V\u00e9rit\u00e9,\" Jean-Luc Godard's \"Contempt,\" Louis Malle's \"Viva Maria!,\" \"Babette Goes to War,\" \"A Very Private Affair,\" \"Spirits of the Dead,\" and \"Shalako.\" She also recorded songs with Serge Gainsbourg. Yet, she said filmmaking was \"never a great passion of mine,\" and she turned down roles opposite Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen and Marlon Brando. She retired from acting in 1973; she was just 39.",
      "Bardot's great passion was promoting the rights of animals, creating the Brigitte Bardot Foundation devoted to the prevention of animal cruelty. She shone a light on the slaughter of baby seals, condemned vivisection and bullfights, protested ritualized animal killings in Muslim ceremonies, and called for the end of wearing fur and the sale of horse meat.",
      "\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told the Associated Press in 2007. \"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"",
      "She was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1985.",
      "However, her views later proved more controversial, as she opposed immigration, particularly by Muslims, into France. She shifted her politics during her fourth marriage, to a man who'd advised Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front. Bardot was convicted and fined five times in French courts for inciting racial hatred over her opposition to Muslim religious practices.",
      "Just as controversial were her opinions about actresses protesting sexual harassment in the film industry during the rise of the #MeToo movement, calling such remarks \"hypocritical.\"",
      "Reflecting on the tragic ends that some stars, like Marilyn Monroe, had faced, Bardot wrote in her 2019 book, \"Tears of Battle: An Animal Rights Memoir,\" \"Knowing that we are nothing and that this life is but a short passage, each person should spend his or her existence improving nature and the fate of human and animal beings. \u2026",
      "\"What I rejected the most during my life as an actress was the limelight. That intense focus on my little person ate at me from the inside. Narcissism is contrary to my nature. When I had to go to film premieres, and all of the spotlights were pointed at me, I hated it. Whenever it was time to decide whether or not to go, my manager usually had to kick me in the rear. This worship of celebrity \u2013 a life perpetually centered around myself \u2013 suffocated me. For quite some time, I could not accept this idolatry, the fact that I was known and recognized because of a few films or the new image of the modern woman they were forging. The second part of my life liberated me. My fame could at least be useful for something, my time on Earth could ease some animal suffering. Selfishness is cruel. When we no longer pay attention to anyone, how are we supposed to care about the way we behave toward others?\""

    "story": [
      "Text messages show that Tyler Perry and \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" actor Mario Rodriguez, who recently filed a lawsuit accusing the filmmaker of sexual assault, remained in contact years after Rodriguez alleges their interactions ended.",
      "Rodriguez alleged in the lawsuit filed last week in California that Perry sexually assaulted him during encounters that occurred between 2014 and 2019. The lawsuit says Rodriguez cut off contact with Perry in 2019, though Perry would periodically reach out afterward. But screenshots of text messages obtained by The Associated Press on Sunday night show Rodriguez making contact with Perry as recently as Thanksgiving 2024 and again on Aug. 31, 2025, expressing gratitude, friendship and financial distress.",
      "Rodriguez's lawsuit seeks at least $77 million in damages and accuses Perry of sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Rodriguez also sued Lionsgate, which distributed \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" in 2016, accusing the studio of overlooking Perry's alleged assault.",
      "Perry denied the allegations made in Rodriguez's suit.",
      "\"Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab,\" Alex Spiro, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement Friday provided to CBS News.",
      "Spiro also told the AP: \"I said it before and I will say it again. This is nothing but a $77 million money grab scam.\"",
      "Lionsgate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In one text message between Rodriguez and Perry that was sent on Thanksgiving 2024, Rodriguez thanked Perry for helping him through difficult periods in his life and wrote that he appreciated him \"to the moon,\" according to the screenshots. In another series of messages dated Aug. 31 this year, Rodriguez described ongoing health problems, said he lacked health insurance and told Perry he was scared and struggling financially.",
      "The messages were provided to the AP by a source close to the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Rodriguez has.",
      "The lawsuit follows a separate case filed in June by actor Derek Dixon, who alleged Perry groped him while Dixon worked on Perry's television series \"The Oval\" and \"Ruthless.\" That lawsuit was originally filed in California state court and later moved to federal court in Georgia, where Perry is based. Perry also has denied Dixon's allegations.",
      "AP reached out to Rodriguez's attorney, Jonathan Delshad, seeking comment on the text messages, but did not receive a response. Delshad also represents Dixon.",

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0 French politicians were divided on Monday over how to pay tribute to the late Brigitte Bardot who, despite her screen legend, courted controversy \u2014 and convictions \u2014 in later life with her far-right views.",
      "The film star died on Sunday at the age of 91 at home in the south of France. Media around the globe splashed iconic images of her and tributes following the announcement.",
      "Bardot shot to fame in the 1956 film \"And God Created Woman\" and went on to appear in about 50 films, but turned her back on cinema in 1973 to throw herself into fighting for animal rights.",
      "But her links to the far-right stirred controversy.",
      "Bardot was convicted five times for hate speech, mostly about Muslims but also about the inhabitants of the French island of Reunion, whom she described as \"savages.\"",
      "She died before dawn on Sunday morning with her fourth husband, Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser to the far right, by her side.",
      "\"She whispered a word of love to him ... and she was gone,\" Bruno Jacquelin, a representative of her foundation for animals, told BFM television.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron hailed her as a \"legend\" of 20th century cinema who \"embodied a life of freedom.\"",
      "Right-wing politicians laud Bardot",
      "Far-right figures were among the first to mourn her.",
      "Marine le Pen, whose National Rally party is riding high in polls, called her \"incredibly French: free, untameable, whole.\"",
      "Bardot backed Le Pen for president in 2012 and 2017 and described her as a modern \"Joan of Arc\" she hoped could \"save\" France.",
      "Conservative politician Eric Ciotti suggested a national farewell like the one organized for French rock legend Johnny Hallyday.",
      "He launched an online petition that had garnered just over 7,000 signatures Monday.",
      "Left-wing politicians temper praise and some are sharply critical",
      "But few left-wing politicians have spoken about Bardot's passing.",
      "\"Brigitte Bardot was a towering figure, a symbol of freedom, rebellion, and passion,\"  Philippe Brun, a senior Socialist party deputy, told Europe 1 radio.",
      "\"We are sad she is gone,\" he said, adding he did not oppose a national homage.",
      "But he did hint at her controversial political views.",
      "\"As for her political commitments, there will be time enough -- in the coming days and weeks -- to talk about them,\" he said.",
      "Communist party leader Fabien Roussel called Bardot a divisive figure.",
      "But \"we all agree French cinema created BB and that she made it shine throughout the world,\" he wrote on X.",
      "Lawmaker Sandrine Rousseau, of the left-leaning Greens Party, was more critical.",
      "\"To be moved by the fate of dolphins but remain indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean -- what level of cynicism is that?\" she quipped on BlueSky.",
      "Bardot's remarks on her funeral raised some eyebrows",
      "Bardot said she wanted to be buried in her garden with a simple wooden cross above her grave -- just like for her animals -- and wanted to avoid \"a crowd of idiots\" at her funeral.",
      "Such a burial is possible in France if local authorities grant permission.",
      "Officials in Saint-Tropez said Monday that Bardot will be buried in a seaside cemetery there, without giving a date.",
      "Born on Sept. 28, 1934 in Paris, Bardot was raised in a well-off traditional Catholic household.",
      "Married four times, she had one child, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, with her second husband, actor Jacques Charrier.",
      "After quitting the cinema, Bardot withdrew to her home in Saint-Tropez to devote herself to animal rights.",
      "Her calling apparently came when she encountered a goat on the set of her final film, \"The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot.\" To save it from being killed, she bought the animal and kept it in her hotel room.",
      "\"I'm very proud of the first chapter of my life,\" she told AFP in a 2024 interview ahead of her 90th birthday.",

      "She had known there would be ghosts in Oxford. She wasn't afraid of any headless horsemen or nuns haunting the local ruins; it was Charlie, always Charlie she was afraid would find her. There had been times in the first year after her sister's disappearance when Martha's heart would stop as she spotted her through the crowd: the long blond hair, the shapeless cardigan draped over a thin cotton dress. She'd hear a laugh, throaty and sudden, or catch a movement, a walk, a twist in the shoulders, and she'd be certain. Just for a moment. Then the illusion would shatter, and the person she knew to be her sister would resolve into a stranger.",
      "As the years passed, so the ghost of Charlie aged. Now it was women in their midthirties who made Martha stop dead in the streets. In Berlin, once a month perhaps, she'd felt that same flickering certainty before realizing the woman with a child on her lap as she drank a coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 was not her sister, just an echo of Martha's own image of who Charlie might be now, thirteen years after fleeing Oxford and her family.",
      "Martha pressed her palm against the wall behind her. She reminded herself of her therapist's mantra for the moments when she was in danger of being overwhelmed. What can you see now? The shiny cobbles of the side street, the white brick of the wall opposite. What can you feel? The bricks under my fingers, a breeze ruffling my hair. What can you smell?

      "She pulled the letter out of her bag again and stared at it. Could it be from Charlie? Impossible. What could this Chorus know? Should she burn it? Throw it in the river? Take it to the police?",
      "Ah, the police. She heard the scrape of her mother's chair on the kitchen floor as she leaped up at the sound of the doorbell. They had found Charlie's bike not far from the ring road. Did she hitchhike? How was her PhD going? Martha couldn't remember their faces, just their hands around tea mugs as they sat at the table, the low rumble of their voices as they talked about stress and pressure. Most runaways come back in time, they'd said. They left literature, helpline numbers, and world-weary sympathy behind them.",

    "summary": "The band announced Perry Bamonte's death on their official website on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Perry Archangelo Bamonte, longtime guitarist and keyboardist for the influential goth band The Cure, has died. He was 65.",
      "The band announced\u00a0his death on their official website on Friday.",
      "\"It is with enormous sadness that we confirm the death of our great friend and bandmate Perry Bamonte, who passed away after a short illness at home over Christmas,\" the band wrote.",
      "\"Quiet, intense, intuitive, constant and hugely creative, 'Teddy' was a warm hearted and vital part of The Cure story,\" the statement continued. \"Our thoughts and condolences are with all his family. He will be very greatly missed.\"",
      "Bamonte worked with the band in various roles from 1984 to 1989, including as a roadie and guitar tech. He officially joined the band in 1990, when keyboardist Roger O'Donnell quit. It was then that he became a full-time member of the group, playing guitar, six-string bass and keyboard.",
      "Having joined just after the band's mainstream breakthrough, 1989's \"Disintegration,\" Bamonte is featured on a number of The Cure's albums, including 1992's \"Wish\" - which features the career-defining hits \u2033Friday I'm in Love\u2033 and \"High\" - as well as the 1996's \"Wild Mood Swings,\" 2000's \"Bloodflowers\" and 2004's self-titled release.",
      "Bamonte was fired from The Cure by its singer and leader, Robert Smith, in 2005. At that point, he had performed at over 400 shows across 14 years. Bamonte rejoined the group in recent years, touring with the band in 2022 for another 90 gigs.",
      "In 2019, Bamonte was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside the rest of The Cure. He joined The Cure on their North American tour in 2024 when the band reduced tickets to as low as $20 after pledging to make the shows affordable for fans following complaints about exorbitant fees. \u00a0Lead singer Robert Smith said at the time he was \"sickened\" by the Ticketmaster fee debacle.",
      "His last performance with the band was on Nov. 1, 2024 in London for a special one-off event to launch their latest album and first in 16 years, \"Songs of a Lost World.\" The concert was filmed for \"The Cure: The Show of a Lost World,\" a film released in cinemas globally this month. It is also available to purchase on Blu-ray and DVD.",

      "Changes are coming to tortillas in California in the new year, with a new law requiring manufacturers to add folic acid to corn masa products. The goal is to decrease birth defects in children born to Hispanic women.",
      "Research shows folic acid promotes new cell growth and can reduce birth defects by up to 70%.",
      "A 1998 U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandate required folic acid to be added to certain enriched grains, such as pasta and rice, but not to corn masa products.",
      "Since then, Latina women have not seen any decrease in their babies being born with neural tube defects in their brains and spinal cords, which is why lawmakers are targeting tortillas.",
      "\"I really was in shock because we grow with these kinds of tortillas since generations, and we never have any problems. We have healthy kids,\" said Dora Sanz, who is the owner of 3 Hermanas in east Sacramento.",
      "The tortillas she is serving customers come from manufacturers, but her family has been making them from scratch for generations.",
      "\"So like, do we really need to put these in the tortillas?\" said Sanz.",
      "Sana Jaffery is the legislative director for Fresno Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula, who authored the bill. She said it costs four pennies to fortify a metric ton of corn masa, but hundreds of dollars for supplements where you get the same vitamins.",
      "Jaffery said lawmakers have briefly looked into making supplements more affordable, but it is a separate issue.",
      "\"It's not only Latinos who eat tortillas, but everybody around the world also eats tortillas,\" said Sanz.",

    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 21:14:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Enhanced tax credits that have helped Americans offset the cost of Affordable Care Act health insurance for the last four years expired overnight.",
    "story": [
      "Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight as 2026 arrived, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one's efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don't get their health insurance from an employer and don't qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters' concerns.",
      "\"It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\" said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \"I'm incredibly disappointed that there hasn't been more action.\"",
      "Subsidies helped reduce costs since pandemic",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It's a strain for the 49-year-old but one he's willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker's monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",
      "Lori Hunt of Des Moines, Iowa, spoke with CBS News during the congressional stalemate in October and said she \"couldn't afford\" health insurance without the subsidies.",
      "\"I'd have to cancel my insurance,\" Hunt said, joking that her insurance would consist of \"thoughts and prayers.\"",
      "Hunt survived breast cancer three years ago and was laid off from her job in 2025. Without the subsidies, she expected her ACA premium would jump to about $700 per month. \"It would be more than my mortgage payment,\" Hunt said.",
      "Many expected to go without coverage",
      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "The impact could be greatest in Florida, which has the largest number of ACA enrollees of any state \u2014 more than 4.7 million, according to KFF data. Texas is next, with more than 3.9 million, followed by California, Georgia and North Carolina.",
      "Kylie Barrios, a 30-year-old Florida resident, said she expected to be among those losing coverage.",
      "\"Our health insurance premium is effectively tripling from 2025 to 2026,\" she told CBS News in December, saying it would rise from about $900 to $2,500.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she'll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter. She can't afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Mr. Trump's big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it's unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don't understand what it's really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\"Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\" said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \"They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\"",
      "Barrios, who said she has generally voted Republican, said she would like politicians to \"act on those values that they ... claim to protect.\"",
      "\"The whole system feels as though it's failed and isn't advocating for me as a small business owner, as somebody who wants to become a mom and have a family,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. has rolled back proposed steep tariffs on Italian-made pasta, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Italy's foreign ministry both said Thursday.",
      "The Commerce Department has sharply reduced a proposed duty on 13 Italian pasta makers, cutting the rate from as high as 92% to as little as 2.26%, Italy's foreign ministry said Jan. 1. The duties would have been imposed on top of existing 15% tariffs on most imports from the European Union.",
      "The Trump administration had proposed the antidumping levies after a review found that Italian pasta producers, including Barilla, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold products at artificially low prices that undercut U.S. manufacturers. Together, the 13 pasta producers account for 16% of imported pasta from Italy to the United States, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "Had the higher duties taken effect, U.S. shoppers could have faced steeply higher prices for Italian-made pasta, and some Italian producers might have stopped shipping to U.S. retailers, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The recalculation of the duties is a sign that U.S. authorities recognize our companies' genuine willingness to cooperate,\" the foreign ministry said.",
      "La Molisana pasta imports will be tariffed at a rate of 2.26%, the foreign ministry said, while Garofalo will face nearly 14% tariffs, and 11 additional pasta brands will be subject to a 9% import duty.",
      "A spokesperson for the Commerce Department told CBS News that the new antidumping rates were based on an \"evaluation of additional comments received\" after the proposed duty rates were determined.",
      "\"This post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination, and reflects Commerce's commitment to a fair, transparent process. Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",

      "A federal appeals court ruling on New Year's Eve blocked Hawaii from enforcing a\u00a0climate change tourist tax\u00a0on cruise ship passengers, a levy that was set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, arguing that the new law violates the U.S. Constitution by taxing cruise ships for entering Hawaii ports. They also argued it would make cruises more expensive.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passenger, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax would generate nearly $100 million annually.",

    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The average cost of a conventional 30-year U.S. mortgage continues to edge down, while rates on other home loans fell to less than 5.5%.",
    "story": [
      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell to its lowest level of 2025 this week, a boost for prospective home buyers.",
      "The average long-term mortgage rate dipped to 6.15% from 6.18% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. That's the lowest average long-term rate since October 3, 2024, when it dipped to 6.12% before shooting back up. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.91%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell this week to 5.44% from 5.5% the previous week. A year ago it averaged 6.13%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors' expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.14% at midday Wednesday, down a touch from last week's 4.15%.",
      "Mortgage rates began easing in July in anticipation of a series of Fed rate cuts, which began in September and continued this month.",
      "The Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don't always translate into lower mortgage rates.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to pay cash or finance at current mortgage rates are in a more favorable position than they were a year ago. Home listings are up sharply from 2024, and many sellers have resorted to lowering their initial asking price as homes take longer to sell, according to data from Realtor.com.",
      "Most homes across U.S. are unaffordable",
      "Still, affordability remains a challenge for aspiring homeowners, especially first-time buyers who don't have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase. Uncertainty over the economy and job market\u00a0is also keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared to a year earlier for the first time since May, despite average long-term mortgage rates holding near their low point for the year. Through the first 11 months of this year, home sales are down 0.5% compared to the same period last year.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:32:26 -0500",
    "summary": "From stubbornly high living costs to a softer labor market, economists say these are the forces that will shape the year ahead.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy navigated 2025 with a resilience that surprised many experts, as growth accelerated and inflation remained relatively muted despite the Trump administration's steep tariffs on imports.",
      "Although Americans say they aren't yet feeling the benefits of an expanding economy amid ongoing concerns about the cost of living, many economists expect the U.S. to be on firmer footing next year.",
      "\"I think it'll be a better year,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"Tax cuts will be center stage, and we'll see a broadening out of economic strength.\"",
      "Here are what experts see as the key economic questions facing the U.S. in 2026.",
      "Will affordability improve?",
      "Probably not \u2014 at least not in a way most Americans will feel right away. Inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, but prices remain elevated, squeezing many households and making it harder to cover basic expenses. About 7 in 10 Americans polled by CBS News in December said they were struggling to pay for food, housing and health care, underscoring the affordability issues affecting millions of households.",
      "Rising utility costs are another challenge. Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utilities, up 12% since last year, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.",
      "More broadly, inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target, with the Consumer Price Index in November at 2.7%. For consumers, that means prices for everyday goods and services are still climbing, continuing to strain household budgets.",
      "Inflation should cool to about 2.4% in 2026, according to a December forecast from the Federal Reserve. But that would still leave inflation above the central bank's goal, signaling that \"higher inflation will continue to weigh on family finances\" next year, William Blair economist Richard de Chazal said in a report.",
      "About one-third of Americans think their finances are likely to worsen in the year ahead, primarily driven by inflation concerns, a recent Bankrate\u00a0survey\u00a0found.",
      "Wages will need to outpace inflation for a sustained period before households feel they are getting ahead, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Dec. 10 press conference.",
      "\"We're going to need to have some years where \u2026 nominal wages are higher than inflation for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" he noted.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve continue to cut interest rates?",
      "Another big question is whether the Federal Reserve will continue cutting its benchmark interest rate after three consecutive reductions that began in September.",
      "Although the Fed has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low, the central bank is currently being pulled in two directions. Prices are rising faster than the Fed would like, which could call for higher interest rates if the trend persists or inflation re-ignites in 2026. At the same time, rising unemployment and cooler hiring might require policymakers to further lower rates in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, in December penciled in only\u00a0one additional rate cut for 2026. Yet some economists believe the Fed could make additional cuts, especially if the labor market continues to slow.",
      "President Trump has argued that the Fed should drastically cut its benchmark rate, pressing Fed Chair Jerome Powell to reduce borrowing costs. With Powell's term set to expire in May, Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new chair who is more open to cutting rates.",
      "Will housing become more affordable in 2026?",
      "Homes across the U.S. could be modestly more affordable in 2026, Chen Zhao, head of economics research at real estate company Redfin, told CBS News.",
      "Mortgage rates are likely to remain in the low 6% range, not far off from today's 30-year mortgage rate of about 6.18%, while home\u00a0prices are likely to grow at a slower pace than incomes next year.",
      "\"We're starting to head on a road that leads to better affordability metrics, but it's not going to be an overnight shift,\" she said. \"2026 might not feel all that different than the end of 2025 \u2014 it's a slow process that might take five or six years, but at least we're heading in the right direction.\"",
      "Home prices are projected to dip in about two dozen major U.S. cities in 2026, mostly located in the Southeast and the West, according to a Realtor.com analysis.",
      "Will the job market pick up steam?",
      "Hiring could improve in 2026 as economic growth accelerates and the effects of tariffs fade, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Average payroll gains could rise to an average of 70,000 per month next year, more than double the 32,000 per month average in 2025, economists with the investment bank forecast in a report. They expect wages to climb 2.3% in 2026, accelerating from 1.9% this year.",
      "However, some economists warn that the job market could remain relatively muted as companies turn to artificial intelligence to improve productivity.",
      "Are stocks in a bubble?",
      "A critical question for financial markets this year \u2014 are companies involved in AI overvalued \u2014 is likely to again take center stage in 2026.",
      "The S&P 500 is on track to end the year with a gain of more than 17%, with the index buoyed by artificial intelligence companies and big tech companies. However, some investors are growing cautious about the meteoric rise of AI-related stocks, questioning whether a bubble is forming.",
      "Such bubbles \u2014 when stock valuations run far ahead of underlying fundamentals \u2014 can set the stage for sharp market corrections if investor sentiment sours. Yet stock valuations remain below the levels seen during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics. He expects investment in AI to continue next year as more companies adopt the technology.",
      "Still, although AI stocks are unlikely to crash next year, investors' lofty expectations may be in for a reality check",
      "\"At some point, investors are likely to be disappointed, and the cycle of ever rising investment, expectations and valuations will end, as proved the case with previous equity bubbles,\" Goltermann said in a report.",
      "Overall, forecasters expect a strong stock market performance in 2026. J.P. Morgan in November forecast the S&P 500 will rise 13% to 15% next year, roughly in line with the index's average gain over the last decade.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-17000-commercial-drivers-licenses-delay-revoking-feds-threat-immigrants/",
    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:15:15 -0500",
    "summary": "In light of a suit by immigrants groups, California says it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses despite a federal threat to withhold $160 million in funding.",
    "story": [
      "A week after immigrant groups filed a lawsuit, California said Tuesday it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses until March to allow more time to ensure that truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify for the licenses can keep them.",
      "But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state may lose $160 million if it doesn't meet a Jan. 5 deadline to revoke the licenses. He already withheld $40 million in federal funding because, he said, California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "California only sent out notices to invalidate the licenses after Duffy pressured the state to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses. An audit found problems like licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's authorization to be in the country expired or licenses where the state couldn't prove it checked a driver's immigration status.",
      "\"California does NOT have an 'extension' to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,\" Duffy posted on the social platform X.",
      "The Transportation Department has been prioritizing the issue ever since a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "California officials said they're working to make sure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms they've put in place. The state had planned to resume issuing commercial driver's licenses in mid-December, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration blocked that.",
      "\"Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy - our supply chains don't move, and our communities don't stay connected without them,\" said DMV Director Steve Gordon.",
      "The Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted. The driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but the non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver's licenses, or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",
      "Mumeeth Kaur, the legal director of the Sikh Coalition, said this delay \"is an important step towards alleviating the immediate threat that these drivers are facing to their lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired. He dropped the threat to withhold $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses because the state was complying.",
      "Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn't have licenses or can't speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department's moves to go after questionable commercial driver's license schools.",
      "And while the federal government says the licenses are illegal and the state says the feds are overreaching, some people in the trucking industry say they're the ones caught in the middle, reports CBS News Sacramento.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:37:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The minutes released Tuesday indicate that some Fed officials who supported the rate cut had reservations.",
    "story": [
      "Some Federal Reserve officials who supported cutting a key interest rate earlier this month could have instead backed keeping the rate unchanged, minutes released Tuesday show, underscoring the divisions and uncertainty permeating the central bank.",
      "At their December 9-10 meeting, Fed officials agreed to cut their key interest rate by a quarter point for the third time this year, to about 3.6%, the lowest in nearly three years.",
      "Yet the move was approved by a 9-3 vote, an unusual level of dissent for a committee that typically works by consensus. Two Fed officials supported keeping the rate unchanged, while one wanted a larger, half-point reduction.",
      "The minutes underscored the deep split on the 19-member policymaking committee over what constitutes the biggest threat to the economy: weak hiring or stubbornly elevated inflation. If a sluggish job market is the biggest threat, then the Fed would typically cut rates more. But if still-high inflation is the bigger problem, then the Fed would keep rates elevated, or even raise them.",
      "Just 12 of the 19 members vote on rate decisions, though all participate in discussions.",
      "The minutes showed that even some Fed officials who supported the rate cut did so with reservations. Some Fed officials wanted to wait for more economic data before making any further moves, the minutes said. Key economic data on jobs, inflation, and growth were delayed by the six-week government shutdown, leaving Fed officials with only outdated information at their meeting earlier this month.",
      "The minutes don't identify specific officials. But how they vote is public, and two policymakers dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged: Jeffrey Schmid, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed.",
      "The third dissent was from Fed governor Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in September and favored a half-point cut.",
      "When the Fed reduces its key rate, over time it can lower borrowing costs for homes, cars, and credit cards, though market forces also affect those rates.",
      "At its December meeting, the Fed also released quarterly economic projections, which also showed the extent of the divisions on the Fed committee. Seven officials projected no cuts in 2026, while eight forecast two or more reductions. Four supported just one cut.",
      "Weaker job market",
      "A weaker job market would likely spur the Fed to reduce borrowing costs more quickly. Two weeks ago, the government reported that employers had cut about 40,000 jobs in October and November, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, a four-year high.",
      "Inflation, meanwhile, remains above the Fed's 2% target, complicating the central bank's next moves. In November, annual inflation cooled to 2.7%, down from 3% in September, but last month's data were likely distorted by the shutdown, economists said, which forced the government to estimate many price changes rather than measuring them directly.",
      "Powell said after the Dec. 10 meeting that the central bank cut rates out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears.",
      "While government data shows that the economy added just 40,000 jobs a month from April through September, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers actually shed an average of 20,000 jobs a month during that period.",
      "\"It's a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,\" Powell told reporters. \"People care about that. That's their jobs.\"",

      "After yesterday's sharp selloff rattled the market, silver rebounded Tuesday, marking the latest twist in what has been a standout year for the precious metal, with prices more than doubling since January.",
      "Silver futures jumped to $78.03 per ounce on Tuesday, a 10% gain, after Monday's 8.7% decline, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "Gold futures have also soared this year, with the precious metal hitting record highs earlier in December.",
      "Investors have been piling into precious metals this year as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical tensions, as well as a hedge against inflation. That's helped drive sharp gains in both silver and gold.",
      "\"Silver saw a record rally in 2025. The 150% increase is significantly higher than that of gold and other assets in the sector,\" noted Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email.",
      "Despite silver's price gains this year, the metal is still far from its inflation-adjusted price record, which was set in 1980, he noted. \u00a0\"To return to that level, silver would have to cost $200 per ounce today,\" he noted.",
      "Monday's selloff in silver was sparked by a technical change at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world's largest commodities trading venues. The exchange said it would require traders to put up more cash to hold positions in silver, gold and other metals after prices surged this year.",
      "The CME raised margin requirements for the contracts in a notice posted Friday. Such moves are designed to protect the exchange by reducing the risk that traders cannot cover their bets if prices swing sharply.",

    "summary": "A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "The White House may not stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, days before funds at the bureau were likely to run out and the consumer finance agency would lack the funds to pay its employees.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman ruled the CFPB can continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, though the Fed is operating at a loss, and the White House has made a new legal argument that way the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.",
      "At the heart of this case is whether White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who is also the acting director of the CFPB, can effectively shut down the agency and lay off all of the bureau's employees. The CFPB has largely been inoperable since President Trump was sworn into office nearly a year ago. Its employees are mostly forbidden from doing any work, and most of the bureau's operations this year has been to unwind the work it did under President Biden and even under Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Vought himself has made comments indicating he intends to effectively shut down the CFPB.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, has been mostly successful in its legal efforts to stop the mass layoffs. The union sued Vought earlier this year and won a preliminary injunction stopping the layoffs.",
      "In recent weeks, the White House has used a new line of argument to potentially get around the court's restraining order. The argument is that the Federal Reserve has no \"combined earnings\" at the moment to fund the CFPB's operations. The CFPB obtains its funding from the Fed through expected quarterly payments.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been operating at a paper loss since 2022 as a result of the central bank's efforts to combat inflation. The Fed holds bonds on its balance sheet from a period of low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but currently has to pay out higher interest rates to banks that hold their deposits at the central bank. The Fed has been recording a \"deferred asset\" on its balance sheet which it expects will be paid down in the next few years as the low interest bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet.",
      "Because of this loss on paper, the White House has argued there are no \"combined earnings\" for the CFPB to draw on. The CFPB has operated since 2011, including under Mr. Trump's first term, drawing on the Fed's operating budget.",
      "White House lawyers sent a notice to the court in early November, where they argued that the CFPB would run out of appropriations in early 2026, under the \"combined earnings\" argument, and does not expect to receive any additional appropriations from Congress.",
      "This combined earnings legal argument is not entirely new. It has floated in conservative legal circles going back to the moment the Federal Reserve started operating at a loss. However, it has never been tested in court.",
      "\"It appears that defendants' new understanding of \"combined earnings\" is an unsupported and transparent attempt to starve the CPFB of funding and yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court's injunction was put in place to prevent,\" Berman wrote in an opinion.",

      "In Republican-led Indiana, the state's flat-rate individual income tax \u2014 a single rate applied to all taxpayers regardless of income \u2014 will fall to 2.95% from 3% at the start of next year, under a budget measure passed by the state legislature in 2023. The rate is slated to drop another 0.05 percentage point to 2.9% in 2027.",
      "Kentucky",
      "Kentucky's individual income tax rate will be cut to 3.5% on Jan. 1, down from its current 4%. The change stems from a 2022 bill that includes a trigger mechanism to incrementally reduce the state's income tax each year, as long as revenue, spending and the budget reserve trust fund meet certain thresholds,\u00a0according\u00a0to Louisville Public Media.",

      "Nebraska",

      "In 2023, the state had a budget of $1.9 billion but now faces a $432 million shortfall,\u00a0according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). Some lawmakers have\u00a0called\u00a0on the state to pause the next phase of income tax cuts to shore up the state's budget.",
      "North Carolina",
      "In North Carolina, where the governor is a Democrat and the state legislature is controlled by Republicans, the individual income tax rate will be reduced from 4.25% to 3.99% in 2026.",

      "Oklahoma",
      "In Republican-led Oklahoma, the top marginal income tax rate will decrease from 4.75% to 4.5% beginning Jan. 1. A tax reform measure signed into law earlier this year also consolidated\u00a0the state's six individual income tax brackets into three.",
      "Additional savings",

    "story": [
      "OpenAI is seeking a new \"head of preparedness\" to guide the company's safety strategy amid mounting concerns over how artificial intelligence tools could be misused.",
      "According to the job posting, the new hire will be paid $555,000 to lead the company's safety systems team, which OpenAI says is focused on ensuring AI models are \"responsibly developed and deployed.\" The head of preparedness will also be tasked with tracking risks and developing mitigation strategies for what OpenAI calls \"frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.\"",
      "\"This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,\" CEO Sam Altman wrote in an\u00a0X\u00a0post describing the position over the weekend.",
      "He added, \"This is a critical role at an important time; models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges.\"",
      "Reached for comment, an OpenAI spokesperson referred CBS News to Altman's post on X.",
      "The company's investment in safety efforts comes as scrutiny intensifies over artificial intelligence's influence on mental health, following multiple\u00a0allegations\u00a0that OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, was involved in interactions preceding a number of suicides.",
      "In one case earlier this year\u00a0covered by CBS News, the parents of a 16-year-old sued the company, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged their son to plan his own suicide. That prompted OpenAI to announce new safety protocols for users under 18.",
      "ChatGPT also allegedly fueled what a lawsuit filed earlier this month described as the \"paranoid delusions\" of a 56-year-old man who murdered his mother and then killed himself. At the time, OpenAI said it was working on improving its technology to help ChatGPT recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations and guide people toward real-world support.",
      "Beyond mental health concerns, worries have also increased over how artificial intelligence could be used to carry out cybersecurity attacks. Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, addressed the issue on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"AI doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors,\" she said. \"It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors, have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.\"",
      "Altman acknowledged the growing safety hazards AI poses in his X post, writing that while the models and their capabilities have advanced quickly, challenges have also started to arise.",
      "\"The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.",
      "Now, he continued, \"We are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides ... in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.\"",
      "According to the job posting, a qualified applicant would have \"deep technical expertise in machine learning, AI safety, evaluations, security or adjacent risk domains\" and have experience with \"designing or executing high-rigor evaluations for complex technical systems,\" among other qualifications.",

      "Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan said last week that, as President Trump searches for a new chair of the Federal Reserve, maintaining the banking system's independence is paramount.",
      "The market \"will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed,\" Moynihan said in a segment for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that was recorded on Dec. 17 and aired Sunday. \"And everybody knows that.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is the nation's central bank and sets the interest rates. At the agency's December meeting, it cut interest rates for the third consecutive time, reducing the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate at which banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%.",
      "Interest rates had dropped to nearly zero during the COVID-19 pandemic, but steadily began rising starting in 2022 to curb inflation. The December rate cut put the benchmark interest rates at their lowest level since Nov. 2022.",
      "Throughout this year, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his displeasure with Jerome Powell, the current Federal Reserve chairman, whose term is set to expire in May 2026. Although the Fed chair is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, it is an independent agency and there is no legal precedent for Mr. Trump to fire the chair for anything but \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court\u00a0found in 1935\u00a0that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court\u00a0did allow\u00a0Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Moynihan said on \"Face the Nation\" that Mr. Trump has \"great candidates\" for when Powell retires in May. But Moynihan warned that he felt there is \"too much fascination with the Fed\" right now.",
      "\"We're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyers \u2014 all these people drive our economy,\" Moynihan said. \"The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack.\"",
      "Moynihan\u00a0 added that while he believed the Fed had a big role in \"stabilizing the economy,\" but \"you shouldn't know they exist, quite frankly.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hold a hearing next week on alleged fraud in Minnesota public assistance programs, Chairman James Comer, announced Wednesday.",
      "The hearing is set to take place Jan. 7 and will include testimony from Minnesota GOP state lawmakers who have investigated public assistance fraud, Comer said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison, both Democrats, have also been asked to testify at a second hearing on Feb. 10, Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said.",
      "\"The U.S. Department of Justice is actively investigating, prosecuting, and charging fraudsters who have stolen billions from taxpayers, and Congress has a duty to conduct rigorous oversight of this heist and enact stronger safeguards to prevent fraud in taxpayer-funded programs, as well as strong sanctions to hold offenders accountable,\" Comer said in a statement.",
      "The House Oversight Committee is investigating allegations of money laundering and fraud in Minnesota's public assistance programs. Comer earlier this month asked Walz and Ellison to turn over to House investigators documents and communications about the state's programs and has sought transcribed interviews with state officials.",
      "\"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison have either been asleep at the wheel or complicit in a massive fraud involving taxpayer dollars in Minnesota's social services programs,\" Comer said. \"American taxpayers demand and deserve accountability for the theft of their hard-earned money.\"",
      "Republican state Rep. Walter Hudson, one of the three Minnesota lawmakers who is set to testify before Congress next week, told CBS News Minnesota he hopes the hearing will offer \"nuance and perspective\" on the fraud issue.",
      "\"What we've seen in the past few days in the wake of the\u00a0Nick Shirley video\u00a0is a lot of sensationalism from a lot of different angles and attempts to turn this into a partisan boxing match, when a point of fact, just a few months ago, this was a very bipartisan issue,\" Hudson said.",
      "More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of what a top prosecutor in Minnesota said was \"industrial-scale fraud.\" The prosecutor, Joe Thompson, said earlier this month that the total amount of fraud in Minnesota could reach $9 billion billed across 14 Medicaid programs that have been deemed \"high risk\" for fraud. Walz and other state officials, however, have questioned that amount.",
      "The scandal began when the nonprofit Feeding Our Future, which is based in Minnesota, was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program by falsely claiming to distribute meals during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 75 people have been charged in the COVID-era fraud scheme, and at least 56 have pleaded guilty.",
      "Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered alleged fraud schemes involving a now-defunct housing stabilization program in Minnesota and a Medicaid-backed state program that provides services to children with autism. Homeland Security agents are also conducting investigations into child care centers in the state after a conservative YouTuber named Nick Shirley posted a video online over the weekend alleging that nearly a dozen centers that receive public dollars are not providing any services.",
      "A CBS News analysis of the day care centers mentioned by Shirley found that all but two have active licenses, according to state records, and state regulators visited the active locations within the last six months. While the centers were cited for safety, cleanliness and other issues, there was no recorded evidence of fraud.",
      "Still, in response to the allegations, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday that it has frozen federal child care payments for Minnesota.",
      "President Trump has denounced Minnesota leaders for their handling of the programs and attacked Somali immigrants, claiming they have \"ripped off\" the state. Many, but not all, of the defendants charged in the fraud schemes are of Somali descent.",
      "In response to the Trump administration's decision to withhold child-care funding to Minnesota, Walz accused the president of \"politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans.\"",
      "\"This is Trump's long game,\" he wrote on social media. \"We've spent years cracking down on fraudsters. It's a serious issue \u2014 but this has been his plan all along.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 21:14:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Enhanced tax credits that have helped Americans offset the cost of Affordable Care Act health insurance for the last four years expired overnight.",
    "story": [
      "Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight as 2026 arrived, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one's efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don't get their health insurance from an employer and don't qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters' concerns.",
      "\"It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\" said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \"I'm incredibly disappointed that there hasn't been more action.\"",
      "Subsidies helped reduce costs since pandemic",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It's a strain for the 49-year-old but one he's willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker's monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",
      "Lori Hunt of Des Moines, Iowa, spoke with CBS News during the congressional stalemate in October and said she \"couldn't afford\" health insurance without the subsidies.",
      "\"I'd have to cancel my insurance,\" Hunt said, joking that her insurance would consist of \"thoughts and prayers.\"",
      "Hunt survived breast cancer three years ago and was laid off from her job in 2025. Without the subsidies, she expected her ACA premium would jump to about $700 per month. \"It would be more than my mortgage payment,\" Hunt said.",
      "Many expected to go without coverage",
      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "The impact could be greatest in Florida, which has the largest number of ACA enrollees of any state \u2014 more than 4.7 million, according to KFF data. Texas is next, with more than 3.9 million, followed by California, Georgia and North Carolina.",
      "Kylie Barrios, a 30-year-old Florida resident, said she expected to be among those losing coverage.",
      "\"Our health insurance premium is effectively tripling from 2025 to 2026,\" she told CBS News in December, saying it would rise from about $900 to $2,500.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she'll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter. She can't afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Mr. Trump's big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it's unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don't understand what it's really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\"Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\" said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \"They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\"",
      "Barrios, who said she has generally voted Republican, said she would like politicians to \"act on those values that they ... claim to protect.\"",
      "\"The whole system feels as though it's failed and isn't advocating for me as a small business owner, as somebody who wants to become a mom and have a family,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump says he underwent a CT scan, rather than an MRI, during his October examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In a new interview, he also says it would have been better if he hadn't undergone the scan at all.",
      "\"In retrospect, it's too bad I took it because it gave them a little ammunition,\" the president said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Thursday. \"I would have been a lot better off if they didn't, because the fact that I took it said, 'Oh gee, is something wrong?' Well, nothing's wrong.\"",
      "In late October, Mr. Trump told reporters he underwent an MRI yielding \"perfect\" results during his examination that month. The White House said in December that \"advanced imaging\" was performed to check his \"cardiovascular and abdominal health.\"",
      "But the president told The Wall Street Journal it was actually a CT scan, and his doctor, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, confirmed that in a statement to CBS News.",
      "CT scans and MRIs are common imaging tests that help doctors see inside the body and diagnose a wide range of conditions. CT scans use a series of X-ray pictures to create a 3D image, typically allowing doctors to identify things like blood clots. An MRI takes longer and uses magnetic and radio waves to produce more detailed images of organs and soft tissue than CT scans.",
      "\"President Trump agreed to meet with the staff and soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Hospital in October,\" Barbabella said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday. \"In order to make the most of the president's time at the hospital, we recommended he undergo another routine physical evaluation to ensure continued optimal health. As part of that examination, we asked the president if he would undergo advanced imaging \u2014 either an MRI or CT Scan \u2014 to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues. The president agreed, and our team of consultants performed a CT Scan. As we revealed in the post-examination report, the advanced imaging was perfectly normal and revealed absolutely no abnormalities.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House and Mr. Trump's doctors have always maintained he received advanced imaging.",
      "\"Additional details on the imaging have been disclosed by the president himself, because he continues to be the most transparent and open president in history and has nothing to hide, unlike his predecessor Joe Biden, who hid from the press and lied about his clear physical and mental decline,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "The president also told the newspaper he doesn't want to lower his daily aspirin dose, something he's used as a blood thinner for over two decades. \"I'm a little superstitious,\" he said.",
      "\"They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart,\" Mr. Trump told the Journal. \"I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?\"",
      "Mr. Trump, 79, isn't a fan of traditional exercise outside of his favorite pastime, golf.",
      "\"I just don't like it. It's boring,\" Mr. Trump said. \"To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that's not for me.\"",
      "Over the summer, the White House announced the president had been diagnosed with a \"benign and common\" vein condition known as chronic venous insufficiency after he noticed swelling in his legs. Barbabella said the examination revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.",
      "The president has at times displayed visible bruises on his hands, which the White House has attributed to frequent handshaking.",
      "\"This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,\" Barbabella said in a memo over the summer.",
      "Ed  O'Keefe and \n                                                  \n                      Kristin  Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is aiming to move a planned 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom through the federal government's review process at a rapid clip, with final approvals as soon as early March \u2014 potentially clearing the way for construction to start a month later.",
      "President Trump has sought to move quickly on the ballroom project, which is the most ambitious \u2014 and controversial \u2014 part of his push to transform the White House complex in line with his aesthetic vision. But the $400 million donor-funded project still needs to get approvals from two boards that oversee federal construction in Washington, D.C.: the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA).",
      "Administration officials met with the two boards and presented drawings on Dec. 19, and formally submitted applications three days later, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "The administration is aiming to hold a public informational meeting before the NCPC next week, on Jan. 8, with a meeting before the CFA one week later. Final presentations to the CFA and NCPC are slated for Feb. 19 and March 5, respectively, the official said.",
      "The National Park Service said in a court filing last month that above-grade construction is \"not anticipated to begin until April 2026, at the earliest.\" Construction is expected to wrap up in the summer of 2028, less than a year before Mr. Trump leaves office, according to a National Park Service assessment filed in court last month.",
      "The Washington Post was first to report the timing of NCPC and CFA approvals.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the NCPC and CFA for comment.",
      "The dates of the NCPC and CFA meetings could shift somewhat. But the administration's timeline for the ballroom is extremely aggressive by the standards of the federal government, which often takes months or years to secure approvals for far smaller projects.",
      "It took several years to design, approve and build a new perimeter fence on the White House grounds during the Obama and first Trump administrations. Officials formally asked the NCPC to review the fencing project concept in June 2016, and the board eventually greenlit the plans in February 2017. Construction on the fence began in 2019.",
      "Approvals took even longer for a pricy project to renovate the Federal Reserve's headquarters, with seven public meetings before the NCPC between September 2019 and March 2021. The commission approved the project in September 2021, and construction is still ongoing.",
      "The NCPC is chaired by White House aide William Scharf, and two other Trump appointees currently serve on the commission. Mr. Trump fired all six sitting members of the CFA in October and is expected to appoint a slate of new members shortly.",
      "Plans for the ballroom have come together at a rapid pace. The White House first announced the project in July. By October, construction crews had demolished the building's entire East Wing, though Mr. Trump said months earlier that the existing structure would be left intact.",
      "At a mid-October dinner to recognize private donors to the ballroom, Mr. Trump marveled at how quickly he was able to get the project off the ground.",
      "\"They said, 'Sir, you can start tonight,\" the president told guests, recounting conversations with staff about the ballroom. \"'You have zero zoning conditions. You're the president.'\"",
      "That approach has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats and preservation\u00a0 groups, who argue the administration failed to properly engage with the public before taking a wrecking ball to part of the White House complex. The White House has argued that NCPC approval is only required for vertical construction, not demolition.",
      "The National Trust for Historic Preservation sued over the project late last year, seeking a temporary halt to construction work until the government gets any necessary approvals. The group has criticized the administration for tearing down the East Wing without seeking reviews and argued the ballroom's size \"will overwhelm the White House itself.\"",
      "\"The American people own these places. And we, the American people, have a right to weigh in when significant changes to them are proposed,\" Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said in an interview with CBS News last month. \"This project needs to follow the already legally mandated processes.\"",
      "A judge last month declined to pause construction outright, but said the administration had to\u00a0 engage the NCPC by the end of 2025. Further hearings on the Trust's request for a preliminary injunction are set for later this month. The judge told the government that if it does any underground construction that \"dictates the size or scale of the proposed ballroom\" before he has a chance to rule, the government \"should be prepared to take it down.\"",
      "At a White House event shortly after the ruling, Mr. Trump celebrated the judge's order and said \"we didn't want to be held up.\"",
      "\"Who else but in our country would sue to stop a $400 million beautiful ballroom that people have been after for the White House?\" the president said.",

    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:59:39 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump used his veto power this week for the first time since returning to the White House, rejecting a pair of bills linked to a Colorado water pipeline and a tribal village in the Everglades.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump used his veto power this week for the first time since returning to the White House, rejecting a pair of bipartisan bills designed to make it easier to build a water pipeline in Colorado and give a Native American tribe more control over a portion of the Everglades.",
      "Mr. Trump vetoed the two bills on Monday, the White House announced on X, after they were sent to his desk earlier this month. The bills had backers in both parties, and they passed the House and Senate through voice votes. Both houses of Congress would need to pass the bills again by a two-thirds margin to override the president's veto.",
      "It's fairly rare for the president to exercise his veto power, especially when the president's party controls Congress. Mr. Trump vetoed 10 bills in his first term, all during his last two years in office, and former President Joe Biden used the veto power 13 times while in office.",
      "Trump vetoes Everglades bill over immigration dispute",
      "One of the bills \u2014 the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act \u2014 would have added a small village called the Osceola Camp to a section of the Florida Everglades that the Miccosukee Native American Tribe has control over. It would also require the Department of the Interior to take action to protect structures in the village from flooding.",
      "The bill was backed by Florida Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody, and by GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez and Democratic Rep. Darren Soto. Shortly before it passed the House in July, Gimenez said the bill was \"about fairness and conservation.\"",
      "\"It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, land and their way of life,\" Gimenez said in a speech on the House floor.",
      "But in a message to Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the project benefits \"special interests\" \u2014 and accused the tribe of not cooperating with his immigration policies.",
      "He wrote that \"despite seeking funding and special treatment from the Federal Government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.\"",
      "Earlier this year, the tribe\u00a0joined a lawsuit\u00a0challenging an immigration detention center in the Everglades that state and federal officials refer to as \"Alligator Alcatraz.\" The tribe has argued the facility could hurt the surrounding environment, impacting the tribe's ability to hunt and hold ceremonies on the land.",
      "The president also argued that the Osceola Camp was originally created without authorization, writing, \"it is not the Federal Government's responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.\"",
      "The tribe said in a statement it was \"disappointed\" by the veto, arguing the bill \"was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests.\"",
      "\"We have never sought to obstruct the President's immigration agenda,\" Miccosukee Tribe Chairman Talbert Cypress said. \"Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments.\"",
      "Soto said: \"Trump's veto appears to be revenge for the Miccosukee Tribe's valid opposition to the atrocious 'Alligator Alcatraz.' It's sad, petty, and a violation of tribal sovereignty.\"",
      "Trump vetoes Colorado water bill \u2014 local lawmakers call it \"revenge\"",
      "The other piece of legislation that faced a presidential veto this week was the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act. That bill was aimed at completing a long-planned water pipeline that could serve some 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.",
      "The pipeline was first proposed during President John F. Kennedy's administration, part of a series of water projects in Colorado. But it was never built, in part because federal law required local communities to pay for it, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. A 2009 law changed the funding breakdown and allowed local governments to pick up only 35% of the tab. The bill that was passed this year would have reduced those local entities' interest payments and given them more time to repay the costs.",
      "Mr. Trump said he vetoed the bill as part of a broader push to cut \"taxpayer handouts.\" He pointed to the pipeline's expected price tag \u2014 the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation estimated in 2023 it would cost about $1.4 billion, double the projected price seven years earlier.",
      "The president argued the legislation \"would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project.\"",
      "The bill was backed by the state's two Democratic senators and by Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Jeff Hurd, whose districts include areas that would be served by the pipeline.",
      "Boebert told CBS News in a statement the veto was \"very disappointing,\" writing: \"This fight is not over.\"",
      "Boebert castigated the veto in a separate\u00a0statement to local reporter Kyle Clark, calling the bill \"completely non-controversial\" and saying she hopes Mr. Trump's veto \"has nothing to do with political retaliation.\"",
      "\"I must have missed the rally where he stood in Colorado and promised to personally derail critical water infrastructure projects,\" Boebert wrote. \"My bad, I thought the campaign was about lowering costs and cutting red tape.\"",
      "Hurd said in a statement he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the veto.",
      "\"The vetoed legislation did not authorize new construction spending or expand the federal government's original commitment,\" Hurd's statement to CBS News read. \"It adjusted repayment terms to reflect decades of federal delay, rising construction costs, and changing regulatory requirements\u2014factors largely outside local control\u2014so existing federal investments could actually result in completed infrastructure and clean drinking water.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado also strongly criticized the president's decision, writing on X: \"Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water.\"",
      "Fellow Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet accused the president of seeking \"revenge.\" In a joint statement with Hickenlooper, the senator argued Mr. Trump was \"putting personal and political grievances ahead of Americans.\"",
      "Boebert drew attention earlier this year by\u00a0breaking with Mr. Trump\u00a0and signing a petition to force a House vote on a bill to release files on Jeffrey Epstein. The bill ultimately passed by nearly unanimous margins after Mr. Trump endorsed it.",
      "Mr. Trump has also lashed out at Colorado officials over the case of Tina Peters, a former GOP county election official who was convicted and sentenced to a multiyear prison sentence for tampering with voting machines. He\u00a0said in August\u00a0he would take \"harsh measures\" if she isn't released from custody.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in California on Wednesday voided the Trump administration's move to terminate the Temporary Protected Status of roughly 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua, calling it a \"pre-ordained decision.\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the termination of the TPS programs for Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua in June and July, saying the three countries had recovered from the environmental disasters that prompted the U.S. government to grant their nationals temporary legal refuge.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, the TPS policy allows the U.S. government to give certain foreigners deportation protections and work permits, temporarily, if their native countries are facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe.",
      "In late July, U.S. District Court Judge Trina Thompson delayed the termination of the TPS programs for Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua, issuing a preliminary finding that the Trump administration failed to consider lingering problems in three nations and that the decision to terminate the policies was motivated by racial animus, or racial hostility. That ruling was paused in August by an appeals court, allowing the Trump administration to end the programs.",
      "But Thompson issued a summary judgment on Wednesday, finding that the effort to revoke the legal status of tens of thousands of Hondurans, Nepalis and Nicaraguans was unlawful. She said Noem's move \"was preordained and pretextual rather than based on an objective review of the country conditions as required by the TPS statute and the (Administrative Procedures Act).\"",
      "\"The record specifically reflects that, before taking office, the Secretary made a pre-ordained decision to end TPS and influenced the conditions review process to facilitate TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal,\" Thompson wrote in her order.",
      "The TPS designations for Honduras and Nicaragua were first created in the late 1990s, after the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch, which killed thousands in Central America. Many of those previously enrolled in those programs arrived in the U.S. more than two decades ago. The TPS policy for Nepal was established in 2015, following a deadly earthquake in the small Asian nation.",
      "The Trump administration has mounted an aggressive effort to dismantle most TPS programs, arguing the policy attracts illegal immigration and that it has been abused by Democratic administrations and extended for far too long. It has also moved to terminate TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Myanmar, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela.",
      "In a statement, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the judge's ruling \"another lawless and activist order from the federal judiciary who continues to usurp the President's constitutional authority.\"",
      "\"Under the previous administration Temporary Protected Status was abused to allow violent terrorists, criminals, and national security threats into our nation,\" McLaughlin said. \"TPS was never designed to be permanent, yet previous administrations have used it as a de facto amnesty program for decades. Given the improved situation in each of these countries, now is the right time to conclude what was always intended to be a temporary designation.\"",
      "Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said Wednesday's ruling should allow TPS holders from Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal to work in the U.S. legally and prevent federal immigration officials from detaining and deporting them.",
      "\"The court's decision today restores TPS protections for thousands of long-term law-abiding TPS-holding residents from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua,\" Arulanantham said.",

      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",

      "In a private ceremony at the abandoned Old City Hall subway station, Mamdani was sworn in by New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "The 34-year-old democratic socialist, who served in the 36th Assembly District representing the Queens neighborhood of Astoria, is now the city's first Muslim mayor and its first of South Asian descent.",
      "\"This is truly the honor and the privilege of a lifetime,\" Mamdani said in a brief speech.",
      "Mamdani called old subway station a \"testament to the importance of public transit to the vitality, the health and the legacy of our city.\" He then announced the appointment of Mike Flynn as his new Department of Transportation commissioner.",
      "Public oath to be taken Thursday afternoon",
      "Mamdani will publicly take the oath of office, administered by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, on Thursday at 1 p.m. at City Hall.\u00a0CBS News New York\u00a0will stream the ceremony live.",
      "The new mayor's public swearing-in will accompany a block party celebration in Lower Manhattan\u00a0that runs from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Anyone planning to attend\u00a0must RSVP online.",
      "Dubbed the \"Inauguration of a New Era,\" it will take place in the famed \"Canyon of Heroes,\" from Liberty Street to Murray Street \u2014 an historic stretch along Broadway. The route is famous for ticker-tape parades that have honored athletes, astronauts, politicians and New York heroes.",
      "The celebration will include music, performances and interfaith elements, Mamdani's transition team said.",
      "Mamdani's inauguration is expected to draw media attention from across the country and around the world.",
      "\"I think there is really going to be a lot of energy. I think many of us who have had a chance to cover Mamdani and to photograph him have really seen the charisma up close, and I think he has really been able to like create these connections to so many different New Yorkers,\" photographer Amanda Briggs said.",
      "In preparation for the transfer of power, Mamdani appointed five new high-ranking members of his administration over the last two days, including a\u00a0new city schools chancellor, Kamar Samuels.",
      "What to know about new DOT Commissioner Mike Flynn",
      "With more than two decades of experience in both the public and private sectors, Flynn will be counted on to help Mamdani achieve many of his affordability goals, including free buses, one of the new mayor's signature policy proposals.",
      "\"It is an honor to have Mike here alongside me as we embark on an administration that will take seriously the responsibility and the opportunity we have to make this streetscape and the public transit of the city we call home the envy of the world,\" Mamdani said during the swearing-in ceremony. \"And it will require someone who's experienced, who is fluent in the landscape as it is, and who is ambitious and imaginative towards the landscape, as it could be. And I can think of no better person than the man alongside me.\"",
      "Prior to his appointment, Flynn was a vice president and sector manager for TYLin City Solutions, where he, according to Mamdani's transition website, \"supported teams of engineers, planners, designers, and community outreach specialists working across disciplines to solve complex transportation, development, and infrastructure challenges throughout the New York City region.\"",
      "Earlier in his career, Flynn worked for the New York City Department of Transportation for almost 10 years, holding senior leadership positions, including Director of Capital Planning and Project Initiation, a role in which he \"guided the planning and delivery of major capital street improvement projects supporting traffic safety, bus priority, and new public spaces citywide,\" Mamdani's website says.",
      "\"I am honored by the trust Mayor Zohran Mamdani has placed in me to lead the Department of Transportation and work alongside this team to deliver for New Yorkers. Transportation is essential to affordability and quality of life, it determines how people get to work, school, and home safely. I look forward to building a DOT that moves faster, puts safety first, and delivers real wins for working New Yorkers,\" Flynn said in a statement.",
      "What transportation experts say about Mike Flynn",
      "Some experts on transportation in the Big Apple say Flynn is an excellent choice to lead the department going forward.",

He is a well-respected expert and leader in city transportation policy and we are excited to help him carry out a vision for better bus service and safer streets,\" Kate Slevin, executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, said in a statement.",
      "\"Mike knows the agency, the city and its streets from the inside out,\" added former city DOT commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan. \"Mike will be a strong voice for Mayor Mamdani and for all New Yorkers in making transportation work for them, and for turning proposals into projects in the ground that will make the city's streets safer, more accessible and affordable.\"",

    "story": [
      "As 2025 drew to a close there is one story that\u00a0captured the nation's attention. It's not the striking of boats off the coast of Venezuela allegedly transporting drugs, or China's announcement of military maneuvers around Taiwan. It is the story of fraud in Minnesota, which federal prosecutors estimate could top $9 billion.",
      "A viral social media video by YouTuber Nick Shirley, which was amplified by Elon Musk, Vice President J.D. Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi, has put the issue into the center of the national conversation, stoking a scandal that has been brewing in state politics for years.",
      "In the wake of the video, the Trump administration announced it is pausing federal funding to child care in Minnesota, with President Trump calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also announced sweeping changes to how all states must submit claims for Medicaid-supported daycares, including requiring \"a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.\"",
      "Even before the video spread far across the internet, however, scandal plagued Minnesota. In 2021, federal law enforcement first probed a series of multimillion dollar fraud schemes. Those fraud schemes have led to federal charges against 92 people with 62 convicted \u2014 and counting.",
      "President Trump and other Republican lawmakers have focused attention on the state's large Somali community, as most of the fraud defendants are of Somali descent, drawing stiff criticism from local officials, including the state's Democratic Governor Tim Walz, who denounced Mr. Trump's criticism as \"vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.\"",
      "Walz, meanwhile, has faced intense scrutiny from both inside and outside Minnesota over his administration's handling of the crisis. The governor has acknowledged in recent weeks that the fraud problem could stretch into the billions, but disputed the $9 billion figure cited by prosecutors.",
      "While Shirley's video focused on allegations of fraud in daycares in Minneapolis, federal investigators told CBS News child care is only \"vaguely\" a priority for prosecutors, and attention and resources are instead focused on more than a dozen other social services programs in Minnesota, including nutrition, housing and behavioral health.",
      "Here's what you need to know:",
      "Feeding Our Future: The case that started it all",
      "This COVID-era $250 million scheme \u2014 which now includes upwards of 75 defendants \u2014 revolved around a nonprofit group called Feeding Our Future. The group claimed to work with restaurants and caterers to distribute meals to schools and extracurricular programs but instead submitted fake meal count sheets and invoices, raking in millions in administrative fees and getting kickbacks from people who ran their meal distribution sites, prosecutors said.\u00a0Feeding Our Future founder Aimee Bock was convicted earlier this year, and several others involved in the scheme have pleaded guilty or been convicted.Early on, Minnesota officials questioned some of the group's filings and slowed approvals of reimbursements, prompting Feeding Our Future to file a lawsuit accusing the state of racial discrimination. The state auditor's office found that \"the threat of legal consequences and negative media attention\" affected the state's decision-making process about regulatory action against Feeding Our Future.What federal prosecutors called \"the largest pandemic era fraud in the United States\" is \"just the tip of a very large iceberg,\" according to FBI Director Kash Patel.",

      "This summer, state officials shut down a fairly new program designed to help seniors and people with disabilities find housing after discovering \"large-scale fraud.\"\u00a0A month later, federal prosecutors charged eight people with defrauding the program, which was run through the state's Medicaid service, by enrolling as providers and submitting millions in \"fake and inflated bills.\"Another five people were charged with bilking the housing program in mid-December \u2014 including two Pennsylvanians with no clear connections to Minnesota who allegedly traveled there in what prosecutors described as \"fraud tourism.\"Prosecutors said the housing stabilization program was susceptible to fraud because it intentionally had \"low barriers to entry\" and few record-keeping requirements.

Another day care shared security footage of people dropping off young children the same day that Shirley arrived and claimed the day care was empty.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:00:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Recent memory serves as a sobering reminder of how critical it is for law enforcement and civilians to be vigilant as crowds gather to celebrate New Year's Eve.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As cities and towns across the U.S. prepare for New Year's Eve and New Year's Day celebrations, local, state and national law enforcement agencies are on the lookout for potential threats \u2014 concerns that are heightened in the wake of the recent Bondi Beach terror attack\u00a0in Australia and the deadly attack on last year's celebrations on Bourbon Street in New Orleans.",
      "Lone actors and small groups with a range of ideological motives pose the most significant threat to New Year's Eve celebrations, according to a joint bulletin from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security reviewed by CBS News.",
      "The assessment, which is done routinely ahead of large public gatherings, notes there is no specific, credible threat this holiday. But the bulletin describes the persistent risk of small groups of people \"seeking to commit acts of violence motivated by a broad range of racial, ethnic, political, religious, anti-government, anti-immigration, societal or ideological beliefs and grievances.\"",
      "Colin P. Clarke, executive director of The Soufan Center, who focuses on domestic and transnational terrorism, called New Year's Eve the \"Super Bowl of counterterrorism\" \u2014 and the \"holy grail for a terrorist.\"",
      "\"It's a soft target, highly symbolic with large crowds gathered,\" Clarke told CBS News. \"It's the holy grail for a group like the Islamic state or a group or individual inspired by the Islamic state.\"",
      "\"New Year's is a symbolic day and it's a symbol of the West, and they're attacking the decadence of the West,\" he added.",
      "In New York City, the NYPD has been working on security for the Times Square area since last year's festivities, said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. There are \"no known specific credible threats\" to the celebration, Tisch said Wednesday, but the public should expect to see \"thousands\" of NYPD officers in the area.",
      "Intelligence teams will also be monitoring social media for threats, Tisch said. Times Square is expecting more than a million visitors from around the world, she noted, making it \"one of the largest and the most complex safety operations anywhere in the world.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Tisch said law enforcement is taking \"a layered approach\" to security, which includes the use of helicopters and drones for real-time monitoring.",
      "Asked about the heightened threat environment, Tisch said that's been the case for the last few years.",
      "\"The NYPD through our intelligence teams really keeps the pulse on what's going on throughout the world,\" she said. \"We have about a dozen detectives stationed in other countries, so any time anything happens we get real-time information and we update our security planning, for example, for events just like this one, based on what we're seeing and learning around the world and trends that we are seeing in counterterrorism.\"",
      "In Las Vegas, Andrew Walsh, undersheriff for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told reporters at a news conference this week that the National Guard will be present in Vegas, as they have been in years past.",
      "Clarke worries that the U.S. has shifted significant resources to immigration and the border, to the potential detriment of counterterrorism operations. He said the \"bench is incredibly thin when it comes to counterterrorism.\"",
      "\"As an American citizen it makes me nervous,\" Clarke said. \"We are vulnerable to a large-scale terror attack.\"",
      "Recent memory serves as a sobering reminder of how critical it is for law enforcement to be vigilant.",
      "Earlier this month, the FBI announced it had\u00a0foiled an alleged New Year's Eve bombing plot in Southern California. The four people who face charges in the alleged plot are members of a group known as the Turtle Island Liberation Front. Attorney General Pam Bondi described the organization as a \"far-left, pro-Palestine, anti-government, and anti-capitalist group.\"",
      "Hundreds of National Guard troops have deployed to New Orleans one year after the devastating New Year's Day attack there, at the request of Louisiana's Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. On Jan. 1, 2025, investigators say Shamsud-Din Jabba rammed a pickup truck into the crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing 14 people and leaving many more injured in an act of terror. The FBI said the attacker, a U.S. Army veteran, was radicalized by ISIS.",

      "Chief Justice John Roberts said Wednesday that the Constitution remains a sturdy pillar for the country, a message that comes after a tumultuous year in the nation's judicial system, with pivotal Supreme Court decisions on the horizon.",
      "Roberts said the nation's founding documents remain \"firm and unshaken,\" a reference to a century-old quote from then-President Calvin Coolidge. \"True then; true now,\" Roberts wrote in his annual year-end letter to the judiciary.",
      "The letter comes after a year in which legal scholars and Democrats raised fears of a possible constitutional crisis as President Trump and GOP supporters pushed back against rulings that slowed his far-reaching conservative agenda.",
      "Roberts weighed in at one point earlier this year, issuing a rare rebuke after Mr. Trump called for the impeachment of a judge who had ruled against him in a case over the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in a March statement. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",
      "Roberts has spoken about the importance of judicial independence before. In his year-end report to close out 2024, he highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "The chief justice's Wednesday letter was largely focused on the nation's history, including an early 19th-century case establishing the principle that Congress shouldn't remove judges over contentious rulings.",
      "While the Trump administration faced pushback in the lower courts, it has scored a series of some two dozen wins on the Supreme Court's emergency docket. The court's conservative majority has allowed the administration to move ahead for now with barring transgender people from the military, clawing back billions of dollars of congressionally approved federal spending, moving aggressively on immigration and firing the Senate-confirmed leaders of independent federal agencies.",
      "The court also handed Mr. Trump a few defeats over the last year, including in his push to deploy the National Guard to U.S. cities.",
      "Other pivotal issues are ahead for the high court in 2026, including arguments over Mr. Trump's push to end birthright citizenship and a ruling on whether he can unilaterally impose tariffs on hundreds of countries.",
      "Roberts' letter contained few references to those issues.",
      "It opened with a history of the seminal 1776 pamphlet \"Common Sense,\" written by Thomas Paine \u2014 a \"recent immigrant to Britain's North American colonies,\" Roberts noted \u2014 and closed with Coolidge's encouragement to \"turn for solace\" to the Constitution and Declaration of Independence \"amid all the welter of partisan politics.\"",

    "story": [
      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"If we don't stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\" of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \"The science is increasingly clear.\"",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "Scientists stress humans' contributions to climate change",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area's population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\"The heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\" Otto said. \"It makes a huge difference.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "Warning times shortened",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources \u2014 what the scientists call \"limits of adaptation.\" The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",
      "Officials, scientists, and analysts have conceded that Earth's warming will overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), though some say reversing that trend remains possible.",
      "Mixed bag in climate change fight",
      "Yet different nations are seeing varying levels of progress.",
      "China is rapidly deploying renewable energies including solar and wind power \u2014 but is also continuing to invest in coal. Though increasingly frequent extreme weather has spurred calls for climate action across Europe, some nations say that limits economic growth. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\"The geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year, with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \"And we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\"",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",
      "\"On a global scale, progress is being made,\" he added, \"but we must do more.\"",

      "ChatGPT also allegedly fueled what a lawsuit filed earlier this month described as the \"paranoid delusions\" of a 56-year-old man who murdered his mother and then killed himself. At the time, OpenAI said it was working on improving its technology to help ChatGPT recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations and guide people toward real-world support.",
      "Beyond mental health concerns, worries have also increased over how artificial intelligence could be used to carry out cybersecurity attacks. Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, addressed the issue on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"AI doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors,\" she said. \"It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors, have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.\"",
      "Altman acknowledged the growing safety hazards AI poses in his X post, writing that while the models and their capabilities have advanced quickly, challenges have also started to arise.",
      "\"The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.",
      "Now, he continued, \"We are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides ... in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hold a hearing next week on alleged fraud in Minnesota public assistance programs, Chairman James Comer, announced Wednesday.",
      "The hearing is set to take place Jan. 7 and will include testimony from Minnesota GOP state lawmakers who have investigated public assistance fraud, Comer said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison, both Democrats, have also been asked to testify at a second hearing on Feb. 10, Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said.",
      "\"The U.S. Department of Justice is actively investigating, prosecuting, and charging fraudsters who have stolen billions from taxpayers, and Congress has a duty to conduct rigorous oversight of this heist and enact stronger safeguards to prevent fraud in taxpayer-funded programs, as well as strong sanctions to hold offenders accountable,\" Comer said in a statement.",
      "The House Oversight Committee is investigating allegations of money laundering and fraud in Minnesota's public assistance programs. Comer earlier this month asked Walz and Ellison to turn over to House investigators documents and communications about the state's programs and has sought transcribed interviews with state officials.",
      "\"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison have either been asleep at the wheel or complicit in a massive fraud involving taxpayer dollars in Minnesota's social services programs,\" Comer said. \"American taxpayers demand and deserve accountability for the theft of their hard-earned money.\"",
      "Republican state Rep. Walter Hudson, one of the three Minnesota lawmakers who is set to testify before Congress next week, told CBS News Minnesota he hopes the hearing will offer \"nuance and perspective\" on the fraud issue.",
      "\"What we've seen in the past few days in the wake of the\u00a0Nick Shirley video\u00a0is a lot of sensationalism from a lot of different angles and attempts to turn this into a partisan boxing match, when a point of fact, just a few months ago, this was a very bipartisan issue,\" Hudson said.",
      "More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of what a top prosecutor in Minnesota said was \"industrial-scale fraud.\" The prosecutor, Joe Thompson, said earlier this month that the total amount of fraud in Minnesota could reach $9 billion billed across 14 Medicaid programs that have been deemed \"high risk\" for fraud. Walz and other state officials, however, have questioned that amount.",
      "The scandal began when the nonprofit Feeding Our Future, which is based in Minnesota, was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program by falsely claiming to distribute meals during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 75 people have been charged in the COVID-era fraud scheme, and at least 56 have pleaded guilty.",
      "Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered alleged fraud schemes involving a now-defunct housing stabilization program in Minnesota and a Medicaid-backed state program that provides services to children with autism. Homeland Security agents are also conducting investigations into child care centers in the state after a conservative YouTuber named Nick Shirley posted a video online over the weekend alleging that nearly a dozen centers that receive public dollars are not providing any services.",
      "A CBS News analysis of the day care centers mentioned by Shirley found that all but two have active licenses, according to state records, and state regulators visited the active locations within the last six months. While the centers were cited for safety, cleanliness and other issues, there was no recorded evidence of fraud.",
      "Still, in response to the allegations, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday that it has frozen federal child care payments for Minnesota.",
      "President Trump has denounced Minnesota leaders for their handling of the programs and attacked Somali immigrants, claiming they have \"ripped off\" the state. Many, but not all, of the defendants charged in the fraud schemes are of Somali descent.",
      "In response to the Trump administration's decision to withhold child-care funding to Minnesota, Walz accused the president of \"politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans.\"",
      "\"This is Trump's long game,\" he wrote on social media. \"We've spent years cracking down on fraudsters. It's a serious issue \u2014 but this has been his plan all along.\"",

      "President Trump says he underwent a CT scan, rather than an MRI, during his October examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In a new interview, he also says it would have been better if he hadn't undergone the scan at all.",
      "\"In retrospect, it's too bad I took it because it gave them a little ammunition,\" the president said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Thursday. \"I would have been a lot better off if they didn't, because the fact that I took it said, 'Oh gee, is something wrong?' Well, nothing's wrong.\"",
      "In late October, Mr. Trump told reporters he underwent an MRI yielding \"perfect\" results during his examination that month. The White House said in December that \"advanced imaging\" was performed to check his \"cardiovascular and abdominal health.\"",
      "But the president told The Wall Street Journal it was actually a CT scan, and his doctor, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, confirmed that in a statement to CBS News.",
      "CT scans and MRIs are common imaging tests that help doctors see inside the body and diagnose a wide range of conditions. CT scans use a series of X-ray pictures to create a 3D image, typically allowing doctors to identify things like blood clots. An MRI takes longer and uses magnetic and radio waves to produce more detailed images of organs and soft tissue than CT scans.",
      "\"President Trump agreed to meet with the staff and soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Hospital in October,\" Barbabella said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday. \"In order to make the most of the president's time at the hospital, we recommended he undergo another routine physical evaluation to ensure continued optimal health. As part of that examination, we asked the president if he would undergo advanced imaging \u2014 either an MRI or CT Scan \u2014 to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues. The president agreed, and our team of consultants performed a CT Scan. As we revealed in the post-examination report, the advanced imaging was perfectly normal and revealed absolutely no abnormalities.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House and Mr. Trump's doctors have always maintained he received advanced imaging.",
      "\"Additional details on the imaging have been disclosed by the president himself, because he continues to be the most transparent and open president in history and has nothing to hide, unlike his predecessor Joe Biden, who hid from the press and lied about his clear physical and mental decline,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "The president also told the newspaper he doesn't want to lower his daily aspirin dose, something he's used as a blood thinner for over two decades. \"I'm a little superstitious,\" he said.",
      "\"They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart,\" Mr. Trump told the Journal. \"I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?\"",
      "Mr. Trump, 79, isn't a fan of traditional exercise outside of his favorite pastime, golf.",
      "\"I just don't like it. It's boring,\" Mr. Trump said. \"To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that's not for me.\"",
      "Over the summer, the White House announced the president had been diagnosed with a \"benign and common\" vein condition known as chronic venous insufficiency after he noticed swelling in his legs. Barbabella said the examination revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.",
      "The president has at times displayed visible bruises on his hands, which the White House has attributed to frequent handshaking.",
      "\"This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,\" Barbabella said in a memo over the summer.",

      "Cellphone video captured harrowing images of the tragedy's first moments as flames swept across the wooden ceiling of the bar's basement level, panicking partygoers who rushed to escape. The fire then rose up and engulfed the upper level.",
      "The cause of the fire remains unknown, but two women told French broadcaster BFMTV they were inside the venue when they saw a waitress, who was being carried on a bartender's shoulders, holding a lit candle in a bottle that ignited the wooden ceiling. The flames spread rapidly, causing the ceiling to collapse, they said.",
      "\"In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood,\" they said.",
      "One of the women described a crowd surge as people frantically tried to escape from a basement nightclub up a flight of stairs and through a narrow door, noting that there were \"about 200 people trying to get out within 30 seconds through some very narrow steps,\" according to a BBC News translation.",
      "Axel Clavier, a 16-year-old from Paris who survived the blaze, said he hadn't seen the fire start, but did see waitresses arrive with Champagne bottles with sparklers.",
      "He described \"total chaos\" inside the bar. One of his friends died and \"two or three were missing,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "In the early stages of the investigation, Valais Canton Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud said it was \"totally unknown\" how many people were inside the bar when the fire broke out, but said authorities would be looking into its maximum capacity.",

      "The Station nightclub fire",
      "The Station nightclub fire\u00a0took place in February 2003 at a club in West Warwick, Rhode Island. The fatal fire resulted in 100 deaths and over 200 injuries.",
      "\"We went out on a Thursday night to listen to music, drink some beers and have a good time. And a quarter of those people didn't get to go home \u2014 ever,\" survivor Linda Saran, who was severely burned in the fire, told CBS News in 2021.",
      "The blaze ignited when the band Jack Russell's Great White took the stage, and four large pyrotechnics were set off, sending flames up the walls and rapidly across the soundproofing foam. The nightclub owners had installed foam along the club's walls and ceilings to combat noise complaints, but the foam was highly flammable, and the club did not have sprinklers installed.",
      "The exits were also a safety issue. Inspection records showed that three months before the fire, the owners had been cited by the local fire marshal for having a secondary, interior door by the stage that opened inward, which violated regulations. They were told to take it down, but it was still up on the night of the fire.",

      "The fire moved so quickly that a few victims still had drinks in their hands while others died hugging or holding hands.",
      "The social club didn't have sprinklers, fire alarms or fire exits. It was operating illegally at the time, as the city had ordered it to close because of the various building and fire code violations.",
      "In the wake of the blaze, New York City tightened fire safety enforcement and stepped up efforts to shut down illegal clubs. Gonzalez was convicted of murder charges for the many deaths in the blaze.",
      "Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire",
      "The Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire, the deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. history, occurred on Nov. 28, 1942, at the Cocoanut Grove club in Boston. A total of 492 people died, and hundreds were injured.",
      "The cause was never officially determined, but the fire started in the basement and spread rapidly through the lounge and up a stairway that acted as a chimney. Many patrons were trapped inside because two exit doors were locked and the single revolving door at the front entrance was jammed with people attempting to flee the blaze.",
      "The club was filled to more than twice its legal capacity when the fire started.",
      "Combustible soundproofing material at the club was blamed for the rapid spread of the fire. The tragedy led to changes in building codes and standards \u2014 such as requiring revolving doors to be flanked by outward-opening standard doors \u2014 as well as medical treatment for burns.",
      "\"The impacts of Cocoanut Grove are already forever enshrined in the regulations, safety practices, the innovations and knowledge that have already saved countless lives,\" Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said at a ceremony in 2022 marking 80 years since the blaze.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump used his veto power this week for the first time since returning to the White House, rejecting a pair of bipartisan bills designed to make it easier to build a water pipeline in Colorado and give a Native American tribe more control over a portion of the Everglades.",
      "Mr. Trump vetoed the two bills on Monday, the White House announced on X, after they were sent to his desk earlier this month. The bills had backers in both parties, and they passed the House and Senate through voice votes. Both houses of Congress would need to pass the bills again by a two-thirds margin to override the president's veto.",
      "It's fairly rare for the president to exercise his veto power, especially when the president's party controls Congress. Mr. Trump vetoed 10 bills in his first term, all during his last two years in office, and former President Joe Biden used the veto power 13 times while in office.",
      "Trump vetoes Everglades bill over immigration dispute",
      "One of the bills \u2014 the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act \u2014 would have added a small village called the Osceola Camp to a section of the Florida Everglades that the Miccosukee Native American Tribe has control over. It would also require the Department of the Interior to take action to protect structures in the village from flooding.",
      "The bill was backed by Florida Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody, and by GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez and Democratic Rep. Darren Soto. Shortly before it passed the House in July, Gimenez said the bill was \"about fairness and conservation.\"",
      "\"It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, land and their way of life,\" Gimenez said in a speech on the House floor.",
      "But in a message to Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the project benefits \"special interests\" \u2014 and accused the tribe of not cooperating with his immigration policies.",
      "He wrote that \"despite seeking funding and special treatment from the Federal Government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.\"",
      "Earlier this year, the tribe\u00a0joined a lawsuit\u00a0challenging an immigration detention center in the Everglades that state and federal officials refer to as \"Alligator Alcatraz.\" The tribe has argued the facility could hurt the surrounding environment, impacting the tribe's ability to hunt and hold ceremonies on the land.",
      "The president also argued that the Osceola Camp was originally created without authorization, writing, \"it is not the Federal Government's responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.\"",
      "The tribe said in a statement it was \"disappointed\" by the veto, arguing the bill \"was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests.\"",
      "\"We have never sought to obstruct the President's immigration agenda,\" Miccosukee Tribe Chairman Talbert Cypress said. \"Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments.\"",
      "Soto said: \"Trump's veto appears to be revenge for the Miccosukee Tribe's valid opposition to the atrocious 'Alligator Alcatraz.' It's sad, petty, and a violation of tribal sovereignty.\"",
      "Trump vetoes Colorado water bill \u2014 local lawmakers call it \"revenge\"",
      "The other piece of legislation that faced a presidential veto this week was the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act. That bill was aimed at completing a long-planned water pipeline that could serve some 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.",
      "The pipeline was first proposed during President John F. Kennedy's administration, part of a series of water projects in Colorado. But it was never built, in part because federal law required local communities to pay for it, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. A 2009 law changed the funding breakdown and allowed local governments to pick up only 35% of the tab. The bill that was passed this year would have reduced those local entities' interest payments and given them more time to repay the costs.",
      "Mr. Trump said he vetoed the bill as part of a broader push to cut \"taxpayer handouts.\" He pointed to the pipeline's expected price tag \u2014 the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation estimated in 2023 it would cost about $1.4 billion, double the projected price seven years earlier.",
      "The president argued the legislation \"would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project.\"",
      "The bill was backed by the state's two Democratic senators and by Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Jeff Hurd, whose districts include areas that would be served by the pipeline.",
      "Boebert told CBS News in a statement the veto was \"very disappointing,\" writing: \"This fight is not over.\"",
      "Boebert castigated the veto in a separate\u00a0statement to local reporter Kyle Clark, calling the bill \"completely non-controversial\" and saying she hopes Mr. Trump's veto \"has nothing to do with political retaliation.\"",
      "\"I must have missed the rally where he stood in Colorado and promised to personally derail critical water infrastructure projects,\" Boebert wrote. \"My bad, I thought the campaign was about lowering costs and cutting red tape.\"",
      "Hurd said in a statement he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the veto.",
      "\"The vetoed legislation did not authorize new construction spending or expand the federal government's original commitment,\" Hurd's statement to CBS News read. \"It adjusted repayment terms to reflect decades of federal delay, rising construction costs, and changing regulatory requirements\u2014factors largely outside local control\u2014so existing federal investments could actually result in completed infrastructure and clean drinking water.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado also strongly criticized the president's decision, writing on X: \"Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water.\"",
      "Fellow Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet accused the president of seeking \"revenge.\" In a joint statement with Hickenlooper, the senator argued Mr. Trump was \"putting personal and political grievances ahead of Americans.\"",
      "Boebert drew attention earlier this year by\u00a0breaking with Mr. Trump\u00a0and signing a petition to force a House vote on a bill to release files on Jeffrey Epstein. The bill ultimately passed by nearly unanimous margins after Mr. Trump endorsed it.",
      "Mr. Trump has also lashed out at Colorado officials over the case of Tina Peters, a former GOP county election official who was convicted and sentenced to a multiyear prison sentence for tampering with voting machines. He\u00a0said in August\u00a0he would take \"harsh measures\" if she isn't released from custody.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. has rolled back proposed steep tariffs on Italian-made pasta, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Italy's foreign ministry both said Thursday.",
      "The Commerce Department has sharply reduced a proposed duty on 13 Italian pasta makers, cutting the rate from as high as 92% to as little as 2.26%, Italy's foreign ministry said Jan. 1. The duties would have been imposed on top of existing 15% tariffs on most imports from the European Union.",
      "The Trump administration had proposed the antidumping levies after a review found that Italian pasta producers, including Barilla, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold products at artificially low prices that undercut U.S. manufacturers. Together, the 13 pasta producers account for 16% of imported pasta from Italy to the United States, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "Had the higher duties taken effect, U.S. shoppers could have faced steeply higher prices for Italian-made pasta, and some Italian producers might have stopped shipping to U.S. retailers, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The recalculation of the duties is a sign that U.S. authorities recognize our companies' genuine willingness to cooperate,\" the foreign ministry said.",
      "La Molisana pasta imports will be tariffed at a rate of 2.26%, the foreign ministry said, while Garofalo will face nearly 14% tariffs, and 11 additional pasta brands will be subject to a 9% import duty.",
      "A spokesperson for the Commerce Department told CBS News that the new antidumping rates were based on an \"evaluation of additional comments received\" after the proposed duty rates were determined.",
      "\"This post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination, and reflects Commerce's commitment to a fair, transparent process. Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in California on Wednesday voided the Trump administration's move to terminate the Temporary Protected Status of roughly 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua, calling it a \"pre-ordained decision.\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the termination of the TPS programs for Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua in June and July, saying the three countries had recovered from the environmental disasters that prompted the U.S. government to grant their nationals temporary legal refuge.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, the TPS policy allows the U.S. government to give certain foreigners deportation protections and work permits, temporarily, if their native countries are facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe.",
      "In late July, U.S. District Court Judge Trina Thompson delayed the termination of the TPS programs for Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua, issuing a preliminary finding that the Trump administration failed to consider lingering problems in three nations and that the decision to terminate the policies was motivated by racial animus, or racial hostility. That ruling was paused in August by an appeals court, allowing the Trump administration to end the programs.",
      "But Thompson issued a summary judgment on Wednesday, finding that the effort to revoke the legal status of tens of thousands of Hondurans, Nepalis and Nicaraguans was unlawful. She said Noem's move \"was preordained and pretextual rather than based on an objective review of the country conditions as required by the TPS statute and the (Administrative Procedures Act).\"",
      "\"The record specifically reflects that, before taking office, the Secretary made a pre-ordained decision to end TPS and influenced the conditions review process to facilitate TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal,\" Thompson wrote in her order.",
      "The TPS designations for Honduras and Nicaragua were first created in the late 1990s, after the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch, which killed thousands in Central America. Many of those previously enrolled in those programs arrived in the U.S. more than two decades ago. The TPS policy for Nepal was established in 2015, following a deadly earthquake in the small Asian nation.",
      "The Trump administration has mounted an aggressive effort to dismantle most TPS programs, arguing the policy attracts illegal immigration and that it has been abused by Democratic administrations and extended for far too long. It has also moved to terminate TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Myanmar, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela.",
      "In a statement, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the judge's ruling \"another lawless and activist order from the federal judiciary who continues to usurp the President's constitutional authority.\"",
      "\"Under the previous administration Temporary Protected Status was abused to allow violent terrorists, criminals, and national security threats into our nation,\" McLaughlin said. \"TPS was never designed to be permanent, yet previous administrations have used it as a de facto amnesty program for decades. Given the improved situation in each of these countries, now is the right time to conclude what was always intended to be a temporary designation.\"",
      "Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said Wednesday's ruling should allow TPS holders from Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal to work in the U.S. legally and prevent federal immigration officials from detaining and deporting them.",
      "\"The court's decision today restores TPS protections for thousands of long-term law-abiding TPS-holding residents from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua,\" Arulanantham said.",

      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",

    "story": [
      "Respondents to an annual Michigan college survey of overused and misused words and phrases say \"6-7\" is \"cooked\" and should come to a massive full-stop heading into the new year.",
      "Those are among the top 10 words on the 50th annual \"Banished Words List,\" released Thursday by Lake Superior State University. The tongue-in-cheek roundup of overused slang started in 1976 as a New Year's Eve party idea, and is affectionately called the list of \"Queen's English for Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness.\"",
      "Around 1,400 submissions came from all 50 states and a number of countries outside the U.S., including Uzbekistan, Brazil and Japan, according to Lake Superior State.",
      "Also in the top 10 are \"demure,\" \"incentivize,\" \"perfect,\" \"gift/gifted,\" \"my bad\" and \"reach out.\" \"My bad\" and \"reach out\" also made the list decades ago \u2014 in 1998 and 1994, respectively.",
      "\"The list definitely represents the fad and vernacular trends of the younger generation,\" said David Travis, Lake Superior State University president. \"Social media allows a greater opportunity to misunderstand or misuse words. We're using terms that are shared through texting, primarily, or through posting with no body language or tone context. It's very easy to misunderstand these words.\"",
      "Few phrases in 2025 befuddled parents, teachers and others over the age of, say 40, more than \"6-7.\" Dictionary.com even picked it as their 2025 word of the year, while other dictionaries chose words like \"slop\" and \"rage bait.\"",
      "But what does \"6-7\" actually mean? It exploded over the summer, especially among Gen Z, and is considered by many to be nonsensical in meaning \u2014 an inside joke driven by social media.",
      "\"Don't worry, because we're all still trying to figure out exactly what it means,\" the dictionary's editors wrote.",
      "Each number can be spoken aloud as \"six, seven.\" They even can be combined as the number 67; at college basketball games, some fans explode when a team reaches that point total.",
      "The placement of \"6-7\" at the top of the banished list puts it in good company. In 2019, the centuries-old Latin phrase \"quid pro quo\" was the top requested phrase to ban from popular use. In 2017, \"fake news\" got the most votes.",
      "Alana Bobbitt, a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, is unapologetic about using \"6-7.\"",
      "\"I find joy in it,\" Bobbitt said. \"It's a little bit silly, and even though I don't understand what it means, it's fun to use.\"",
      "Jalen Brezzell says a small group of his friends use \"6-7\" and that it comes up a couple of times each week. But he won't utter it.",
      "\"Never. I don't really get the joke,\" said Brezzell, a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. \"I don't see what's funny about it.\"",
      "But banning it, even in jest, might be a bit of a stretch, he said, adding that he does use other words and phrases on the list.",
      "\"I've always used the word 'cooked,'\" Brezzell said. \"I just think it got popular on the internet over this past year. It's saying, like, 'give it up, it's over.'\"",
      "Some of the phrases do have longevity, Travis said.",
      "\"I don't think they'll ever go away, like 'at the end of the day,'\" he said. \"I used 'my bad' today. I feel comfortable using it. I started using it when I was young. A lot of us older people are still using it.\"",
      "Travis said that while some terms on the list \"will stick around in perpetuity,\" others will be fleeting.",

      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, arguing that the new law violates the U.S. Constitution by taxing cruise ships for entering Hawaii ports. They also argued it would make cruises more expensive.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passenger, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax would generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake last week upheld the law, and the plaintiffs appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. government intervened in the case and also appealed Otake's ruling.",

      "The latest protests, taking root in economic issues, have heard demonstrators chant against Iran's theocracy as well. The country's leaders are still reeling after Israel launched a 12-day war against the country in June. The U.S. also bombed Iranian nuclear sites during the war.",
      "\"The people of Iran want freedom. They have suffered at the hands of the Ayatollahs for too long,\" Mike Waltz, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said in a post on X earlier this week.",
      "\"We stand with Iranians in the streets of Tehran and across the country as they protest a radical regime that has brought them nothing but economic downturn and war,\" he said.",
      "The most intense violence appeared to strike Azna, a city in Iran's Lorestan province, some 185 miles southwest of Tehran. There, online videos purported to show objects in the street ablaze and gunfire echoing as people shouted: \"Shameless! Shameless!\"",
      "The semiofficial Fars news agency reported three people had been killed. Other media, including pro-reform outlets, cited Fars for the report while state-run media did not fully acknowledge the violence there or elsewhere. It wasn't clear why there wasn't more reporting over the unrest, but journalists had faced arrest over their reporting in 2022.",
      "In Lordegan, a city in Iran's Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, online videos showed demonstrators gathered on a street, with the sound of gunfire in the background. The footage matched known features of Lordegan, some 290 miles south of Tehran.",
      "Fars, citing an anonymous official, said two people were killed during the protests Thursday.",
      "The Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran said two people had been killed there, identifying the dead as demonstrators. It also shared a still image of what appeared to be an Iranian police officer, wearing body armor and wielding a shotgun.",
      "In 2019, the area around Lordegan saw widespread protests and demonstrators reportedly damaged government buildings after a report said people there had been infected with HIV by contaminated needles used at a local health care clinic.",
      "A separate demonstration Wednesday night reportedly led to the death of a 21-year-old volunteer in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's Basij force.",
      "The state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member's death but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, which is believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Saeed Pourali, a deputy governor in Lorestan province.",
      "The Guard member \"was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defense of public order,\" he reportedly said. Another 13 Basij members and police officers suffered injuries, he added.",
      "\"The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns,\" Pourali said. \"The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.\"",
      "The protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, over 250 miles southwest of Tehran. Local prosecutor Kazem Nazari said 20 people had been arrested after the protests and that calm had returned to the city, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported.",
      "Iran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been trying to signal it wants to negotiate with protesters. However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial currency has rapidly depreciated, with $1 now costing some 1.4 million rials.",
      "Meanwhile, state television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had links to European-based groups. State TV also said another operation saw security forces confiscate 100 smuggled pistols, without elaborating.",
      "Iran's theocracy had declared Wednesday a public holiday across much of the country, citing cold weather, likely as a bid to get people out of the capital for a long weekend. The Iranian weekend is Thursday and Friday, while Saturday marks Imam Ali's birthday, another holiday for many.",

      "Crans-Montana, Switzerland\u00a0\u2014 A fire at a crowded bar in the Swiss Alps during New Year's Eve celebrations killed about 40 people and left 115 injured, many of them seriously, police said Thursday. Switzerland's president said many of the dead were teenagers.",
      "The blaze tore through a bar called Le Constellation in the Alpine ski resort municipality of Crans-Montana, Switzerland.",
      "Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, said it was too early to determine the cause of the fire, but indicated it was not related to terrorism.",
      "\"At no moment is there a question of any kind of attack,\" Pilloud said.",
      "Experts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage. Pilloud said the number of people who were in the bar is \"currently totally unknown,\" adding that its maximum capacity will be part of the investigation.",
      "\"An investigation has been opened, not against anyone, but to illuminate the circumstances of this dramatic fire,\" she said.",
      "The fire broke out around 1:30 a.m. local time, and helicopters and ambulances rushed to the scene to assist victims, officials said.",
      "\"More than a hundred people were in the building, and we are seeing many injured and many dead,\" police spokesperson Ga\u00ebtan Lathion said.",
      "\"We are devastated,\" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gisler, commander of the Valais Cantonal police, said during a news conference.",
      "The injured were so numerous that the intensive care unit and operating theater at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, according to regional councilor Mathias Reynard. He said it's likely that some burn patients will soon be transferred to neighboring countries for treatment.",
      "The European Union said it has been in contact with Swiss authorities about providing medical assistance. France's foreign ministry said several survivors have been transferred to to French \u200dhospitals.",
      "\"We're just at the beginning of our investigation, but this is an internationally renowned ski resort with lots of tourists,\" Lathion said.",
      "Officials said they expected a number of foreign nationals to be among the dead. France said eight of its citizens were missing.",
      "\"There were people screaming\"",
      "Cellphone video captured harrowing images of of the tragedy's first moments as flames swept across the wooden ceiling of the bar's basement level, panicking partygoers who rushed to escape. The fire then rose up and engulfed the upper level.",
      "Two women told French broadcaster BFMTV that they were inside when they saw a bartender carrying a waitress on his shoulders. They said she was holding a lit candle in a bottle that set fire to the wooden ceiling. The flames quickly spread and collapsed the ceiling, they told the broadcaster.",
      "\"In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood,\" one of the women said, according to a BBC News translation.",
      "They described a crowd surge as people frantically tried to escape from the basement level up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door.",
      "There were \"about 200 people trying to get out within 30 seconds through some very narrow steps,\" BBC quoted the woman as saying. \"We were very lucky.\"",
      "Axel Clavier, a 16-year-old from Paris who survived the blaze, described \"total chaos\" inside the bar. One of his friends died and \"two or three were missing,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "He said he hadn't seen the fire start, but did see waitresses arrive with Champagne bottles with sparklers, he said.",
      "Clavier said he felt like he was suffocating and initially hid behind a table, then ran upstairs and tried to use a table to break a Plexiglas window. It fell out of its casing, allowing him to escape.",
      "\"I'm still in shock,\" he said.",
      "Another witness speaking to BFMTV described people smashing windows to escape the blaze, some gravely injured, and panicked parents rushing to the scene in cars to see whether their children were trapped inside. The young man said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames and likened what he saw to a horror movie as he watched from across the street.",
      "Local resident Samuel Rapp, 21, was at a restaurant nearby and went to the scene after the blaze broke out.",
      "\"Police and paramedics ... had already set up a protective perimeter,\" he told the Reuters news agency. \"There were people screaming, and then people lying on \u200cthe ground, probably dead. They had jackets over their faces.\"",
      "Officials called the blaze an \"embrasement g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9,\" a firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.",
      "Officials said they are prioritizing forensic work so that the bodies of the victims can be returned to their families, but said the process may take several days, Reuters reported.",
      "\"This evening should have been a moment of celebration and coming together, but it turned into a nightmare,\" said Reynard, the regional government leader.",
      "\"What was a moment of joy turned into a tragedy in Crans-Montana last night, felt across the country and beyond,\" Swiss President Guy Parmelin said in a social media post. \"The Federal Council has taken note of this with deep dismay. Its thoughts are with the victims, the injured and their families and it extends its deepest condolences.\"",
      "Hundreds of people stood in silence near the scene as they came to pay their respects to the victims on Thursday night. Many left flowers or lit candles at a growing memorial site along the road leading to the bar, which police had cordoned off. Some cried, others quietly hugged one another.",
      "In a region busy with tourists skiing on the slopes, the authorities have called on the local population to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require medical resources that are already overwhelmed.",
      "The Crans-Montana community is in the heart of the Swiss Alps, just 25 miles north of the Matterhorn.",
      "With high-altitude ski runs in the heart of the Swiss Alps, Crans-Montana is one of the winter sports centers of Switzerland's ski-crazy Valais region, also home to Zermatt, Verbier and other resorts nestled in the snowy peaks and pine forests that draw winter sports enthusiasts from across the planet. The resort is one of the top race venues on the World Cup circuit in Alpine skiing and will host the next world championships over two weeks in February 2027.",
      "In four weeks' time, the resort will host the best men's and women's downhill racers for their last events before going to the Milan Cortina Olympics, which open on Feb. 6.",

    "story": [
      "Actor George Clooney and his wife Amal Clooney were\u00a0granted French citizenship\u00a0because \"they contribute, through their distinguished actions, to France's international influence and cultural outreach,\" the French government said Wednesday, defending their naturalization that was questioned by a junior French minister.",
      "The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the \"Ocean's\" series of heist movies, his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their twins Ella and Alexander were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.",
      "Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior minister at the Interior Ministry, expressed misgivings Wednesday that some of the Clooneys' new French compatriots may think that the star couple was granted special treatment. The actor speaks only what he himself says is \"horrible, horrible\" French.",
      "\"The message being sent is not good,\" Vedrenne said in an interview with broadcaster France Info. \"There is an issue of fairness that, in my eyes, is absolutely essential.\"",
      "President Trump piled on the criticism against the move, saying France was welcome to the two-time Academy Award winner, a long-time vocal critic of the U.S. leader.",
      "\"Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday.",
      "He added, \"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies. He wasn't a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The couple purchased an estate in France in 2021 and Clooney has said that it's their primary residence. Non-French residents of France have multiple possible routes to becoming naturalized. It wasn't clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the Clooneys were eligible for citizenship under a French law that allows for the naturalization of foreign nationals who contribute to France's international influence and economic well-being.",
      "It argued that France's cinema industry will benefit from the actor's clout as a global movie star and said that as a lawyer, Amal Clooney regularly works with academic institutions and international organizations in France.",
      "\"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community,\" it concluded, giving the actor's first name a French twist by adding the \"s\" at the end.",
      "The decision was also defended by Vedrenne's superior at the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, who said he signed the naturalization decree.",
      "\"It's a big chance for our country,\" he said.",
      "In recent media interviews, when he was promoting \"Jay Kelly,\" Clooney said that he is trying to teach himself French using a language-learning app. He said that his wife and children speak the language perfectly.",
      "\"They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face and I don't know,\" he joked, speaking to French\u00a0broadcaster Canal+.",
      "French media have reported that the Clooneys live part-time in their luxury 18th-century villa outside the town of Brignoles in southern France, where they can keep a lower profile and their children are protected from unauthorized photographs by French privacy laws.",
      "In an interview with Esquire in October, Clooney said: \"I was worried about raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood.\"",
      "\"I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids,\" he said. Growing up away from the spotlight in France, \"they have dinner with grown-ups and have to take their dishes in. They have a much better life.\"",

    "summary": "At midnight on New Year's Eve, revelers across the globe will sing \"Auld Lang Syne,\" but not everyone knows the lyrics to the New Year's song or its origin.",
    "story": [
      "As the clock strikes midnight and the world ushers in 2026, revelers around the globe will sing \"Auld Lang Syne,\" a song about \"old acquaintance be forgot\" and, well, other lyrics people may not recall from the New Year's song.",
      "The song's origins date back to an 18th-century Scottish ballad, with \"Auld Lang Syne\" eventually becoming a New Year's celebration staple. Experts explained the song's lyrics, origin and staying power.",
      "What does \"auld lang syne\" mean?",
      "Roughly translated, the phrase means \"old long since,\" or \"for old time's sake.\" The song title is actually in Scots language, which is similar to English, according to Scotland's national tourist board.",
      "\"'Auld Lang Syne' can be literally translated as 'Old Long Since,' but the literal English does not give a sense of what it means to a user of Scots, where it refers to a shared past underpinning the current relationships of a family, community or professional/social association,\" professor Murray Pittock, a literary historian with the Centre for Robert Burns Studies at the University of Glasgow, told CBS News in 2023. \"As such, it is more evocative, nostalgic and communally unifying than any simple English equivalent.\"",
      "What are the song's origins?",
      "Today's song comes from a publication by Scottish poet Robert Burns. The poet was trying to preserve Scottish language and culture after Scotland and England formed the United Kingdom, according to Scotland's national tourist board. So he traveled the country and collected old Scots poetry and songs, including \"Auld Lang Syne.\"",
      "\"Burns said in one of the letters on view that he listened to an old man singing the song and that it had never been in print or in manuscript until he wrote it down from that old man singing,\" Christine Nelson, who once curated an exhibition on the song\u00a0at the Morgan Library in Manhattan, told CBS News in 2012.",
      "The song Burns wrote down can be traced back to \"Auld Kyndness Forgot,\" which was preserved in a manuscript from 1568, Pittock said.",
      "Historians believe that Burns substantially rewrote the words.",
      "\"He didn't make any secret of the fact that he was doing what he called 'mending' these old songs,\" Nelson said in her 2012 interview. \"So that they could be, you know, given to the public for posterity.\"",
      "His words were first published in 1796, according to the Library of Congress. Burns also sent a slightly revised version to a publisher in 1793, but that version was not published until 1799 \u2014 three years after Burns' death. The best-known set of words for \"Auld Lang Syne\" is the one published in 1799.",
      "Why do we sing the song every New Year's Eve?",
      "While the song has Scottish roots, its popularity in the U.S. is owed to a Canadian.",
      "Bandleader Guy Lombardo popularized it after he and his Royal Canadian Big Band played it on a New Year's Eve broadcast in 1929. In 1965, Lombardo told LIFE\u00a0magazine that he came from a part of western Ontario home to a large Scottish population. In that area, it was traditional for bands to end every dance with \"Auld Lang Syne.\"",
      "\"The main reason why Lombardo became identified as the Ghost of New Years Past, of New Years Present and of New Years Yet to Come, he says, 'is because Auld Lang Syne is our theme song \u2014 and was long before anyone ever heard us on the radio,'\" LIFE\u00a0reported.",
      "After Lombardo's 1929 broadcast, \"Auld Lang Syne\" went on to become part of popular culture, playing in \"Forrest Gump,\" \"Sex and the City\" and \"When Harry Met Sally.\"",
      "Harry and Sally even have a conversation about the song, trying to figure out its meaning.",
      "\"My whole life, I don't know what this song means,\" Harry, played by actor and comedian Billy Crystal, says in the 1989 movie. \"I mean, 'should old acquaintance be forgot?' Does that mean that we should forget old acquaintances or does it mean that if we happen to forget them, we should remember them, which is not possible because we already forgot 'em?\"",
      "\"Well, maybe it just means that we should remember that we forgot them or something,\" Meg Ryan's character Sally responds. \"Anyway, it's about old friends.\"",
      "The\u00a0U.S. Embassy in Italy\u00a0may have explained it best in a blog post: \"The lyrics of 'Auld Lang Syne' pose the question: How do we best remember the memories, friends and experiences of years before? The answer, Burns tells us, is to 'share a cup of kindness yet' as we journey into the new year.\"",

    "summary": "As the U.S. and Israel back Iranians' right to protest against their leaders, authorities in Tehran detain students and declare a sudden holiday.",
    "story": [
      "Tehran \u2014 Iran's prosecutor general said Wednesday that economic protests that have gripped the country were legitimate, but he warned that any attempt to create insecurity would be met with a \"decisive response,\" as the Islamic Republic's rulers tried to clamp down on a fourth day of unrest.",
      "\"Peaceful livelihood protests are part of social and understandable realities,\" Mohammad Movahedi-Azad told state media after protests started by shopkeepers in the capital city Tehran, which were joined by students and others in several cities across the country.",
      "\"Any attempt to turn economic protests into a tool of insecurity, destruction of public property, or implementation of externally designed scenarios will inevitably be met with a legal, proportionate and decisive response,\" warned Movahedi-Azad.",
      "His comments came days after the Mossad intelligence agency of Iran's arch-foe Israel posted on social media that it was \"with you on the ground,\" in a message to Iranian protesters. Posting on its Persian-language X account, the spy agency encouraged Iranians to \"go out into the streets together.\"",
      "In a post shared via its own Farsi language account on X, the U.S. State Department said Wednesday that it was \"deeply concerned by reports and videos that peaceful protesters in Iran are facing intimidation, violence, and arrests.\"",
      "\"Demanding basic rights is not a crime. The Islamic Republic must respect the rights of the Iranian people and end the repression,\" the U.S. government said in the post.",
      "\"First the bazaars. Then the students. Now the whole country. Iranians are united. Different lives, one demand: respect our voices and our rights,\" the State Department said in a subsequent post.",
      "The protests come amid mounting tension between the U.S. and Iran after President Trump said he had heard, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that Iran could be attempting to rebuild its nuclear program following the unprecedented U.S. strikes on its enrichment facilities in June. Mr. Trump warned that if Iran did try to rebuild, \"we'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Iran's president said Tehran would respond \"to any cruel aggression\" with unspecified \"harsh and discouraging\" measures.",
      "The protests, driven by dissatisfaction at Iran's economic stagnation and galloping hyperinflation, began Sunday in Tehran's largest mobile phone market, where shopkeepers shuttered their businesses. They gained momentum through Tuesday, with students at 10 universities in the capital and in other cities, including Iran's most prestigious institutions, joining in.",
      "Nevertheless, the protests remain limited in number and concentrated in central Tehran, with shops elsewhere in the sprawling metropolis of 10 million people unaffected. And the government appeared to be cracking down on the unrest, both on the streets with a heavy security presence, and by declaring a last-minute holiday to prompt the closure of schools and businesses.",
      "Iran's economy has been in the doldrums for years, with heavy U.S. and international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program weighing heavily on it. The currency, the rial, has also plunged in recent months, losing more than a third of its value against the U.S. dollar since last year.",
      "Videos posted on social media have shown crowds chanting anti-government slogans as they marched through the streets, while others show security forces using tear gas and purportedly live ammunition. CBS News has not been able to independently verify the video clips posted online, some of which show heavily armed security forces appearing to detain multiple people, including students, and others in which apparent gunfire can be heard.",
      "The Guild Council of the University of Tehran said six students were detained but later released. There were unconfirmed reports that at least one student was severely injured during a confrontation with security services in Tehran.",
      "A last-minute holiday",
      "The streets of Tehran were calm early Wednesday, a change from the usual chaotic and choking traffic, after authorities announced a national holiday with just a day's notice. Many schools, banks and public institutions were closed, with officials saying the directive was due to the cold weather and the need to save energy.",
      "The capital's prestigious Beheshti and Allameh Tabataba'i universities announced that classes would be held online throughout next week for the same reason, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.",
      "The authorities did not link the bank holiday to the protests. Tehran is experiencing daytime temperatures near the freezing mark, which is not unusual for this time of year.",
      "Weekends in Iran begin on Thursdays, while this Saturday marks a long-standing national holiday.",
      "Iran is no stranger to nationwide protests, but the latest demonstrations have not come close to the last major outbreak in 2022, which was triggered by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian woman.",
      "Her death in custody after being arrested for allegedly violating the nation's strict dress code for women sparked a wave of anger across the country. Several hundred people were killed, including dozens of members of the security forces, who waged a dramatic crackdown in response, arresting hundreds of people.",
      "There were also widespread protests in 2019, sparked by a sharp increase in the price of petrol.",

      "Tokyo \u2014 Nearly 60 women lawmakers in Japan, including Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, have submitted a petition calling for more toilets in the parliament building to match their improved representation.",
      "Although the number of women politicians rose in the last election -- and despite Takaichi becoming the first female prime minister in October -- Japanese politics remains massively male-dominated.",
      "This is reflected by there being only one lavatory containing two cubicles near the Diet's main plenary session hall for the 73 women elected to the lower house, according to the petition.",
      "\"Before plenary sessions start, truly so many women lawmakers have to form long queues in front of the restroom,\" said Yasuko Komiyama, from the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party.",
      "She was speaking after submitting the cross-party appeal signed by 58 women to Yasukazu Hamada, the chair of the lower house committee on rules and administration, earlier this month.",
      "The Diet building was finished in 1936, nearly a decade before women got the vote in December 1945 following Japan's defeat in World War II.",
      "The entire lower house building has 12 men's toilets with 67 stalls and nine women's facilities with a total of 22 cubicles, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.",
      "Japan ranked 118 out of 148 this year in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report. Women are also grossly under-represented in business and the media.",

      "In the last election, in 2024, 73 women were elected to the 465-seat lower house -- one has since left -- up from 45 in the previous parliament. There are 74 women in the 248-seat upper house.",
      "The government's stated target is to have women occupy at least 30 percent of the legislative seats.",
      "Takaichi, an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said before becoming premier that she wanted \"Nordic\" levels of gender balance in her cabinet.",
      "But, in the end, she appointed just two other women to her 19-strong cabinet.",
      "Takaichi, 64, has said she hopes to raise awareness about women's health struggles and has spoken candidly about her own experience with menopause.",
      "But she is still seen as socially conservative.",
      "She opposes revising a 19th-century law requiring married couples to share the same surname and wants the imperial family to retain male-only succession.",
      "The increasing demand for women's toilets can be seen as a sign of progress for Japan although it also reflects the nation's failure to achieve gender equality, Komiyama said.",
      "\"In a way, this symbolizes how the number of female lawmakers has increased,\" Komiyama told reporters, according to her party's website, adding that she hoped for more equality in other areas of life.",

    "summary": "U.S.-British firm Ocean Infinity intends to scour almost 6,000 square miles of seafloor for the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777.",
    "story": [
      "Almost 12 years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished over the Indian Ocean with 239 people on board, the search for the Boeing 777's wreckage was scheduled to resume Tuesday in the Indian Ocean \u2014 supported by the latest advancements in deep-sea, self-guided drone technology.",
      "MH370 took off from Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur shortly after midnight on March 8, 2014. It should have been a routine, roughly six-hour flight north to Beijing.",
      "About 40 minutes later, the aircraft's transponder switched off, which made it disappear from civilian air traffic control monitors. Military radar, however, picked up the plane banking sharply west, back over the Malay Peninsula and out over the third largest body of water in the world, the vast Indian Ocean.",
      "The initial search for the aircraft covered more than 46,000 square miles off the coast of western Australia, an area larger than the state of Virginia. But using drift analysis, incorporating data on the history of ocean currents and winds, the people in charge of the search have now narrowed down the area of highest probability for success to around 5,800 square miles.",
      "British-American deep sea robotics company Ocean Infinity has not revealed the location of the new search, but it hopes to finally solve the tragic mystery by deploying a fleet of the world's most advanced underwater drones.",
      "The drones, or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), are capable of diving nearly 20,000 feet and running for up to 100 hours before they need to resurface. They're equipped with side-scan sonar to create detailed 3D images of the seafloor \u2014 and anything on it \u2014   as they cruise near the bottom, following the contour up and down mountains and into trenches hidden in the abyss.",
      "The AUVs can also use ultrasound imaging to peer beneath seafloor sediment that's built up over the years, as well as magnetometers that could detect metals in the wreckage of the lost aircraft.",
      "If an object of interest is detected, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) would then be deployed to take a closer look.",
      "To date, fewer than 30 fragments believed to be from MH370 have washed up on different shores across the Indian Ocean.",
      "The first was found in 2015, on the French island of La R\u00e9union, more than 400 miles off the eastern coast of Madagascar. A beach cleaner found a flaperon that would have helped the plane roll to the left or right during flight.",
      "Through 2016, more fragments were found washed ashore on Madagascar itself, as well as in Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Mauritius, including a door that covered the front landing gear, a flap from the right wing, and a panel from where a wing joined onto the aircraft's fuselage \u2014 what should have been one of the aircraft's strongest joints.",
      "So far, no remains of the aircraft's crew or passengers \u2014   who came from 14 countries including China, Australia, France, the United States, Ukraine and Russia \u2014   have been found.",

      "Cecilia Gim\u00e9nez, the Spanish woman whose botched restoration of a century-old painting of Jesus Christ captured global headlines more than a decade ago, has died. She was 94.",
      "Officials in Borja, northeastern Spain, confirmed Gim\u00e9nez's death on Facebook. Mayor Eduardo Arilla told a local newspaper she died in a nursing home, The New York Times reported.",
      "The foundation that manages the church in Borja where the \"Ecce Homo\" fresco is displayed\u00a0said she was a great lover of painting from a young age. The foundation called her \"one of the most famous figures of 2012\" and noted that she had, \"with the best intentions, decided to repaint\" the fresco at the Sanctuary of Mercy Church because of its poor condition.",
      "Gim\u00e9nez's attempt left Christ's face cartoonish and unrecognizable, sparking a flood of online reactions, memes, and parodies featuring famous figures such as Michael Jackson and Homer Simpson.",
      "Her restoration added what appeared to be a mane to the figure of Christ, leading the small painting by local artist Elias Garcia Martinez, created in the 1910s, to be nicknamed the \"Monkey Christ.\"",
      "At the time, Gim\u00e9nez acknowledged the damage, but she told a state-run broadcaster that the parish priest authorized the restoration.",
      "\"The priest knew! He did! How could we do something like that without permission? He knew,\" Gim\u00e9nez said. \"Everybody who came into the church could see me as I was painting. I didn't do anything secretly.\"",
      "The controversy quickly turned Borja into a tourist destination, with about 57,000 visitors coming to see the previously little-known church the following year.",
      "When the controversy subsided, supporters helped Gim\u00e9nez put on an art exhibition featuring 28 of her own paintings, CBS News partner BBC News\u00a0reported.",

      "No one was seriously injured following the incident on the Macugnaga cable car, which travels up to the Moro Pass at an altitude of 2,800 meters (9,000 feet) near the Swiss border, a spokesman for the Alpine rescue services told the Agence France-Press news agency.",

      "Three of the 15 passengers in the upper cabin were hurt, along with an operator at the lower station, it said.",
      "The crash happened at about 11:30 a.m. local time. Authorities said it took about three hours for all of those stranded to be evacuated by helicopter.",
      "Filippo Besozzi, administrator of the company that manages the cable car, told the ANSA news agency that the most seriously injured was a 59-year-old man who hurt his arm.",
      "He said there had been a \"technical problem\" and the cable car did not slow down properly as it entered the station, and hit a barrier.",
      "He said there was no significant damage to the cable car, which was renovated in 2023, but it was undergoing checks.",

    "summary": "2025 was the third hottest year on record and pushed Earth past a critical climate change mark, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"If we don't stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\" of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \"The science is increasingly clear.\"",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "Scientists stress humans' contributions to climate change",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area's population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\"The heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\" Otto said. \"It makes a huge difference.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "Warning times shortened",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources \u2014 what the scientists call \"limits of adaptation.\" The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",
      "Officials, scientists, and analysts have conceded that Earth's warming will overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), though some say reversing that trend remains possible.",
      "Mixed bag in climate change fight",
      "Yet different nations are seeing varying levels of progress.",
      "China is rapidly deploying renewable energies including solar and wind power \u2014 but is also continuing to invest in coal. Though increasingly frequent extreme weather has spurred calls for climate action across Europe, some nations say that limits economic growth. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\"The geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year, with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \"And we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\"",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",
      "\"On a global scale, progress is being made,\" he added, \"but we must do more.\"",

We will keep working to provide more options \u2014 expanding choices for delivery devices and creating new pathways for access \u2014 so more people can get the medicines they need.\"",
      "No. 2: Side effects",

He recommends that physicians conduct regular body measurements of patients and adjust the medication dosage if benchmarks are not being met.",
      "Finding success and sticking to it",
      "Healthcare providers who approve the use of these medications without \"carefully following\" the patients can contribute to failure of the medications, according to Decotiis.",
      "\"Many of the patients who quit their GLP-1 drugs could have stayed on them with the right personalized care.\"",
      "\"Often, using a customized dosing plan helps the patient avoid undue side effects and helps them burn more fat, which is the mechanism by which GLP drugs work long-term and systemically,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"For certain patients, a high-quality compounded GLP-1 can achieve tailored dosing.\"",

      "Dr. Nicole Saphier joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to give tips on staying physically and mentally healthy this holiday season.",
      "If the stress of the holidays wreaked havoc on your gut, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 76% of Americans experience gastrointestinal distress during the holiday season, according to a recent national survey from Oshi Health and YouGov.",
      "Digestive problems can be triggered not only by holiday overeating, but also by stress. Financial worries, disrupted routines, fatigue and interpersonal dynamics rank as some of the top causes.",
      "\"I see an uptick in psychiatry-related GI issues during the holiday season,\" Dr. Claire Brandon, a gastrointestinal psychiatrist based in New York City, told Fox News Digital. \"When you are undergoing stress, your body produces more corticotropin-releasing hormones, which sets off a cascade of the inflammatory system.\"",
      "GUT IMBALANCE MAY BE DRIVING AMERICA\u2019S FOOD ALLERGY EPIDEMIC, EXPERTS WARN",
      "Stress hormones can act directly on the gut, leading to more digestive distress and pushing the body out of \"rest-and-digest mode,\" Brandon said.",
      "\"Stress activates the sympathetic \u2014 fight, flight, freeze \u2014 nervous system, which slows digestion,\" added Dr. David Clarke, an Oregon-based gastroenterologist and president of the Association for the Treatment of Neuroplastic Symptoms. \"That can lead to bloating, cramps, nausea and sometimes abdominal pain.\"",
      "Stress often plays a bigger role in digestive issues than overeating alone, experts say. (iStock)",
      "The good news, doctors say, is that a few simple, realistic steps can help reset the digestive system after the holidays.",
      "No. 1: Reset your sleep",
      "Sleep plays a major role in gut health. Research shows that insufficient or disrupted sleep can change the composition and function of the gut microbiome, potentially affecting metabolic and immune factors that influence overall health.",
      "NOT ALL FIBER IS CREATED EQUAL \u2014 DOCTORS SHARE WHICH KINDS TRULY SUPPORT LONGEVITY",
      "\"When I travel and get derailed, my main focus is to reset my sleep,\" Brandon said. She recommends reestablishing wind-down routines like deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation.",
      "No. 2: Eat balanced, fiber-rich meals",
      "Fiber helps keep digestion moving and supports healthy gut bacteria, which can aid post-holiday recovery, experts say.",
      "\"The usual principles for supporting digestion apply here,\" said Clarke. \"Consuming a balanced diet emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes; avoiding highly processed foods; and moderating alcohol will keep your gut microbiome happy.\"",
      "Digestive symptoms like bloating and discomfort often spike during the holidays due to stress, travel and disrupted routines. (iStock)",
      "No. 3: Stay hydrated",
      "Staying hydrated will also aid digestion, Clarke said, noting that light-colored urine is a good indicator of hydration.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "Traveling can be particularly tough on the gut, experts say, especially during flights where low cabin humidity causes the body to pull water from the bowels, leading to constipation.",
      "Drinking water before, during, and after flights \u2014 and limiting alcohol and caffeine \u2014 can help counteract dehydration-related digestive slowdowns. Experts also recommend sipping water consistently throughout the day.",
      "No. 4: Resume regular movement",
      "Both doctors agreed that exercise supports digestion and stress regulation, which are both key to gut recovery.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"Going on walks can be enough to help with this, but if you have space to do more, including some gentle stretching, that can be a huge help,\" Brandon advised.",
      "No. 5: Reduce stress gradually",
      "Stress management plays a critical role in gut health, and experts say that small, consistent habits can help ease gastrointestinal symptoms.",
      "Brandon recommends calming the nervous system with breathing or grounding exercises and slowing down at meals.",
      "Light movement can help support digestion and regulate stress, experts say. (iStock)",
      "\"If you\u2019re constantly running on fumes, on a layover in the airport, eating high sugar and doing things off your routine, expect a few disruptions with your gut,\" she said. \"Reframe it as something that you can reset when you get home.\"",
      "No. 6: Skip cleanses and detoxes",
      "Clarke says that detoxes and cleanses are not necessary and can actually be harmful. Instead, he recommends sticking to the basics \u2014 including hydration, balanced meals, regular sleep and movement.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Doctors say the gut is designed to recover on its own in response to consistently healthy practices rather than extreme resets.",
      "Experts recommend returning to balanced, fiber-rich meals instead of intense cleanses. (iStock)",

      "President Donald Trump spent the first year of his second White House term signing a torrent of executive orders aimed at delivering on several major policy priorities, including slashing federal agency budgets and staffing, implementing a hard-line immigration crackdown and invoking emergency authority to impose steep tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.",
      "The pace of Trump\u2019s executive actions has far outstripped that of his predecessors, allowing the administration to move quickly on campaign promises.

      "Lawsuits have challenged Trump's most sweeping and consequential executive orders, ranging from a ban on birthright citizenship and transgender service members in the military to the legality of sweeping, DOGE-led government cuts and the president\u2019s ability to \"federalize\" and deploy thousands of National Guard troops.",

      "President Donald Trump speaks to the media after signing an executive order at the White House. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",
      "WINS:",
      "In June 2025, the Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration 6-3 in Trump v. CASA, a closely watched case centered on the power of district courts to issue so-called universal or nationwide injunctions blocking a president's executive orders.",
      "Though the case ostensibly focused on birthright citizenship, arguments narrowly focused on the authority of lower courts' ability to issue nationwide injunctions and did not wade into the legality of Trump's order, which served as the legal pretext for the case. The decision had sweeping national implications, ultimately affecting the more than 310 federal lawsuits that had been filed at the time challenging Trump's orders signed in his second presidential term.",
      "Justices on the high court ultimately sided with U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer, who had argued to the court that universal injunctions exceeded lower courts\u2019 Article III powers under the Constitution, telling justices that the injunctions \"transgress the traditional bounds of equitable authority,\" and \"create a host of practical problems.\"",
      "The Supreme Court largely agreed. Justices ruled that plaintiffs seeking nationwide relief must file their lawsuits as class action challenges. This prompted a flurry of action from plaintiffs in the weeks and months that followed as they raced to amend and refile relevant complaints to lower courts.",
      "The Supreme Court also signaled openness to expanding presidential authority over independent agencies.",
      "Earlier in 2025, the justices granted Trump\u2019s request to pause lower-court orders reinstating two Democratic appointees \u2014 National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) member Gwynne Wilcox and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) member Cathy Harris, two Democrat appointees who were abruptly terminated by the Trump administration. It also suggested the Supreme Court is poised to pare back a 90-year-old precedent in Humphrey\u2019s Executor, a 1935 ruling that prohibits certain heads of multi-member, congressionally created federal regulatory agencies from being fired without cause.",
      "It is not the only issue in which the justices appeared inclined to side with Trump administration officials and either overturn or pare back Humphrey\u2019s protections.",
      "In December, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter, a similar case centered on Trump's attempt to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission without cause. Justices seemed likely to allow the firing to proceed and to weaken Humphrey's protections for similarly situated federal employees, though the extent that justices will move to dilute an already watered-down court ruling remains unclear.",

Trump, the case centered on Trump's use of an emergency wartime law to enact his sweeping tariff plan.",
      "At issue in the case is Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact his steep 10% tariffs on most imports. The IEEPA law gives the president broad economic powers in the event of a national emergency tied to foreign threats. But it's unclear if such conditions exist, as voiced by liberal and conservative justices in their review of the case earlier in 2025.",
      "Several justices also noted that the statute does not explicitly reference tariffs or taxes, a point that loomed large during oral arguments.",
      "A ruling against the administration would deliver a major blow to Trump's signature economic policy.",
      "Court watchers and legal experts said after arguments that a Trump administration win could be more difficult than expected, though each cautioned it is hard to draw conclusions from roughly two hours of oral arguments, a fraction of the total time justices spend reviewing a case.",
      "Jonathan Turley, a law professor and Fox News contributor, said in a blog post that the justices \"were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers.\"",
      "\"However, there is a real chance of a fractured decision that could still produce an effective win for the administration,\" Turley added.",
      "Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the CATO Institute, told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement that members of the court seemed uncomfortable with expanding presidential power over tariffs.",

      "A whiskey sour for the distilled spirits industry.",
      "Consumers are souring on drinking alcohol.",

      "TARIFFS PUSH US WINE INDUSTRY INTO UNCERTAIN TERRITORY: 'REALLY CREATES A CHALLENGE'",
      "\"Bourbon is Kentucky, right? We love horse racing in Kentucky. We love bourbon in Kentucky. It's the reason that 2.7 million people come to visit the Commonwealth every single year,\" said Coffey. \"It\u2019s some of the biggest news to come out of Kentucky in quite some time, and this is one of the most iconic brands in bourbon.\"",
      "Not everyone has heard of Willett or Four Roses when it comes to bourbon. But Jim Beam is Americana. Ubiquitous. Kind of like McDonald\u2019s or Coke.",
      "Americans are imbibing less \u2014 down 6% from just two years ago. And more than 16 million barrels of Kentucky spirits \u2014 including bourbon and rye \u2014 are aging in warehouses across the state. Distillers are paying taxes on those barrels while they age.",
      "It\u2019s an issue of supply and demand. But the problem is not exclusive to Jim Beam.",
      "\"It's not a question of who's shutting down production,\" said Charlie Prince, who runs the Drammers Whiskey Club. \"It's a question of who is admitting it.\"",
      "Barrels of bourbon are stacked in a barrel house at the Jim Beam Distillery Feb. 17, 2020 in Clermont, Ky. U.S. whiskey exports have fallen by 27% to the European Union, the product's largest export market, caused by retaliatory tariffs imposed by the 27-nation alliance, a trade group said last week. (Bryan Woolston/Getty Images)",
      "Overseas distillers like Midleton in Ireland, which makes Jameson, and Highland Park in Scotland all reduced production recently because of a glut of bourbon, whiskey and Scotch on the market.",
      "However, observers say tariffs and the trade war with Canada hit Jim Beam especially hard.",
      "\"Ten percent of Kentucky bourbon sales were going to Canada, and that has dropped to almost zero,\" said Prince. \"In Canada, that has been taken on as a kind of a national mission for Canadians, saying, \u2018Let's buy Canadian\u2019 and push back against the politics they don't like coming from the U.S. And, so, you see stores just pulling all American products and banning them in some provinces. So, that's definitely a political response.\"",
      "Democrats quickly latched onto the tariff argument.",
      "\"Thousands of Kentuckians power the bourbon industry. We will all feel the impact of this,\" declared Rep. Morgan McGarvey, D-Ky. \"It\u2019s hard to overstate just how devastating Trump\u2019s tariffs are for America\u2019s signature spirit.\"",
      "RECORD LOW NUMBER OF AMERICANS REPORT DRINKING ALCOHOL, AND NEW TEETOTALERS ARE EXPLAINING WHY",
      "But one industry observer believes that tariffs are a single ingredient in a complex economic cocktail.\u00a0Jessica Spector is a professor at Yale who studies the history and culture of liquor and spirits.",
      "\"Anybody that tells you that they have an explanation, \u2018Oh, it's tariffs,\u2019 or 'Oh, it's post-pandemic retraction,\u2019 is giving you a too simplistic explanation,\" said Spector. \"It's unclear what impact the tariffs are having and will have in the future. People have argued over tariffs for a long time. As long as there has been trade, there have been arguments over tariffs. It's unclear whether the tariffs are sort of the coup de gras to an industry that was already suffering.\"",
      "Spector says yes, Generation Z drinks less and uses cannabis more. There are also health concerns. But the spirits industry has witnessed shifts before. She says people moved from brown liquor to vodka in the 1970s because it was seen as healthier.",
      "\"They also jogged more and did a lot more cocaine because that was seen as more health conscious. So, it gets really complicated when you break things down generationally,\" said Spector.",
      "But the tariffs remain extraordinarily controversial. The Trump administration says tariffs are here to stay.",

      "\"Tariffs are going to be part of the policy landscape,\" United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Fox. \"We know they\u2019re successful.\"",
      "But the tariffs may also evaporate.",
      "The Constitution grants Congress the authority to tax and impose tariffs. President Trump used emergency powers to levy global tariffs earlier this year. That\u2019s why this issue wound up at the Supreme Court. Attorneys argued the case in October.",
      "\"Canada is one of our closest allies. I think it would be hard to find Canada engaging in unfair trade practices because we have what used to be called the NAFTA agreement, between Canada, the United States and Mexico to bring down all the trade barriers between the countries,\" said University of California law professor John Yoo.",
      "Based on the oral arguments, Yoo believes the high court will halt the Trump-imposed tariffs under the premise that the U.S. faces a national emergency.",
      "\"Canada will immediately benefit, and you'll be able to find your choice of American bourbons on Canadian store shelves,\" said Yoo.",
      "FREEDOM AND FACTS, NOT FEAR, SHOULD FRAME AMERICA'S CHOICES ON ALCOHOL",
      "In fact, Yoo believes the Supreme Court could issue its ruling sooner rather than later \u2014 especially if it nixes the tariffs. That\u2019s because of all the duties and fees that might be levied on products for months \u2014 and then reversed.",
      "It\u2019s important to note that Jim Beam will continue operating two other distilleries for the time being. And Spector says Generation Z prefers cocktails. So, that could force the industry to shift what it produces.",
      "Now here\u2019s a little tidbit you probably won\u2019t learn any place else.",
      "Roam any distillery in Scotland, be it Dalwhinnie in the Highlands, Glen Scotia in Campbeltown, GlenGrant in Speyside or Bowmore on Islay, and you will find distillers aging Scotch in Jim Beam barrels.",
      "It\u2019s not just Jim Beam barrels that you will find in Scotland. It\u2019s also Buffalo Trace. Heaven Hill. Woodford Reserve. Wild Turkey. Congress only allows American distillers to use American oak barrels once for producing bourbon. So, Scotch distillers overseas love to get their hands on a good bourbon barrel to age their spirit.",
      "The barrels may partially impart a vanilla flavor into the expression, stemming from \"vanillans\" in the wood.",
      "The Jim Beam Distillery Feb. 17, 2020, in Clermont, Ky. \u00a0 (Bryan Woolston/Getty Images)",
      "The trend of using American bourbon barrels for Scotch began in the 1940s after the U.S. market came back online following the end of Prohibition. Distillers in Scotland began using sherry barrels to age their spirits prior to that (hence, the rich meaty flavors you get from Macallan). Sherry is still prevalent despite a decline in people consuming sherry these days. But fewer bourbon barrels from a big producer like Jim Beam now could alter the taste of Scotch in about 15 to 20 years.",
      "That said, demand for Scotch is down like bourbon. So, some of these may even out.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that Suntory Global Spirits owns Jim Beam. It was known as Beam Suntory until recently. Suntory also owns major Scotch labels like Bowmore, Admore, Laphroaig, Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch. The pipeline of barrels from Jim Beam was a good proposition for Suntory to age Scotch.",
      "So, it\u2019s possible that, down the road, Scotch distillers may age some of their expressions in barrels that once contained something else \u2014 other than Kentucky bourbon. And that\u2019s where the flavor profile will evolve.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "It\u2019s also impossible to know the market trends and what people will be interested in drinking in 15 to 20 years. And, so, whatever distillers put into a barrel now might not match market trends in the future.",
      "In fact, perhaps people will revert to drinking bourbon and Scotch. And the market glut now may switch into a spirits famine where products consumers want are hard to find.",

      "What's in your \"digital file\" and why it's a problem in 2026",

      "If you want 2026 to be your safest year yet, the best thing you can do is reduce the amount of personal data available about you online, starting with data brokers.",
      "Why data brokers make it so hard to delete your information",
      "Technically, data brokers have to delete your data if you request it. But here's the part they don't advertise: They want you to give up. Some brokers hide their opt-out pages behind dozens of clicks. Others require you to fax forms, upload IDs, or repeat the request every 30\u201390 days because they\u00a0reactivate your profile without warning. Now multiply that by 180\u2013500+ data brokers, depending on your location. This is why most people never delete their information: it's just too time-consuming.",

      "The holiday season creates a surge in data sharing. Retailers, loyalty programs, airlines, travel sites and apps collect huge amounts of personal information in November and December. Shoppers often share email addresses, phone numbers and location data to unlock discounts and faster checkout.",
      "Holiday spending continues to rise year over year. More spending means more data. As a result, your personal information spreads across more databases than at any other time of the year.",
      "After the holiday rush, data brokers update and expand their profiles using newly collected information. January is when many of these companies organize, repackage and resell their datasets.",
      "Starting the removal process early helps limit how widely your information gets shared. Since removals can take days or even weeks, acting now reduces exposure before that data circulates further.",
      "From January through April, scammers ramp up activity tied to tax season. Common threats include\u00a0IRS impersonation scams, fake refund messages and W-2 fraud. Many of these attacks rely on data pulled from broker databases.",
      "When scammers have accurate personal details, their messages feel more convincing. Reducing your data exposure now lowers the risk. Removing your information from major data broker sites is a strong first step. It also helps to check smaller, lesser-known sites that may still list your details.",

      "Make a short list of the pages where your information appears.",
      "Instead of spending weeks contacting each site manually, a data removal service can handle the work for you. You submit the links you found, and the service requests removals on your behalf across hundreds of databases.",

      "Data brokers do not stop collecting information. Even after removals, your data can reappear months later. Ongoing monitoring helps catch new listings and remove them before they spread further.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

In fact, the holidays and the start of a new year often bring a surge in scams, account takeovers and data theft. The good news is that cybersecurity need not feel overwhelming.

      "AMERICA'S MOST-USED PASSWORD IN 2025 REVEALED",
      "Strong passwords and two-factor authentication stop most account takeovers before they start. (Peter Steffen/picture alliance)",
      "1) Start the year with strong passwords",
      "Passwords remain your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into multiple accounts at once. Use a unique password for every account. Longer passphrases work better than short, complex strings. A reputable password manager can generate and securely store passwords, so you do not have to memorize them. One rule matters most. Never reuse passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second step after your password. This usually includes a code from an app or a physical security key. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA can block access. App-based authenticators provide stronger protection than text messages. Turn it on for email, banking, social media and shopping accounts first.",
      "3) Audit your digital presence",
      "Old accounts create new risks. Take time to review shopping sites, forums, apps and subscriptions you no longer use. Delete what you do not need. Update privacy settings on what you keep. Share less personal information whenever possible, especially birthdays, locations and phone numbers. A smaller digital footprint limits abuse.",
      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Simple habits like updating software and thinking before you click block common scams. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Keep software and devices up to date",
      "Security updates fix real vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. Skipping updates leaves doors open. Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, apps, routers and smart devices. This habit blocks many common attacks without extra effort. Outdated software remains one of the top causes of successful hacks.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service",
      "Your personal information appears on hundreds of data broker sites. These sites collect names, addresses, phone numbers and relatives, then sell access to anyone willing to pay. A personal data removal service helps locate and remove that information. This step reduces scam attempts, phishing messages and identity fraud risks throughout the year. Less exposed data means fewer threats.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection",
      "Identity theft often starts quietly. A breach happens. Data leaks. Fraud follows months later. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Many services can also scan for accounts tied to multiple email addresses, making cleanup easier. Early alerts help you act before damage spreads.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SNEAKY WEB INJECTION SCAMS",
      "Backups, secure Wi-Fi and identity monitoring help limit damage when breaches happen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7) Think before you click and use strong antivirus protection",
      "Most cyberattacks still begin with a click. Fake shipping notices, refund alerts and urgent messages push people to act fast. Pause before clicking links or opening attachments. Many scams now use AI to generate realistic messages, fake voices and convincing images, making it even more important to pause before you click. Verify messages through official websites or apps instead. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by blocking malware, ransomware and malicious downloads across your devices, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "8) Secure your home Wi-Fi network",
      "Your Wi-Fi network connects everything. That makes it a valuable target. Change the default router password right away. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it. Keep router firmware up to date and avoid sharing your network with unknown devices. A secure network protects every connected device.",
      "9) Back up your data regularly",
      "Backups protect you from ransomware, hardware failure and accidental deletion. Many people still skip them. Use cloud backups, an external hard drive or both. Automate the process so it runs without reminders. If something goes wrong, backups let you recover quickly.",
      "10) Freeze your credit if you do not need it",
      "A credit freeze prevents new accounts from opening in your name. It remains one of the strongest defenses against identity fraud heading into 2026. Freezing credit is free and reversible. You can temporarily lift it when applying for loans or credit cards. This single step blocks many identity crimes outright. To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Pro tip: Lock down your email and use aliases",
      "Your email account controls password resets, alerts and account recovery. If attackers get in, they can reach nearly everything else. Secure your primary email with a long, unique password and two-factor authentication. Then create email aliases for shopping, subscriptions and sign-ups. Aliases limit exposure when a company suffers a data breach and make phishing easier to spot. Protecting email this way strengthens every other cybersecurity resolution.",
      "By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A safer digital life starts with small, consistent decisions. Strong passwords, updates, backups and awareness go a long way. By committing to these cybersecurity resolutions, you set yourself up for a more secure 2026. You also make it harder for criminals to profit from stolen data. There is no better time to start than now.",

      "A new phishing campaign is exploiting a visual trick that is easy to miss and hard to unsee once you know it. Attackers are using the domain rnicrosoft.com to impersonate Microsoft and steal login credentials. The trick is simple. Instead of the letter m, scammers place r and n side by side. In many fonts, those letters blur together and look almost identical to an m at a quick glance.",
      "Security experts are sounding the alarm because this tactic works. These emails closely copy Microsoft branding, layout and tone, which makes them feel familiar and trustworthy. That false sense of legitimacy is often all it takes to get a quick click before you realize something is wrong.",

      "Cybersecurity experts warn of a new phishing scam that uses the fake domain rnicrosoft.com to mimic Microsoft and steal login credentials. (Photo by Oliver Berg/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Why your brain falls for the rn trick",
      "This attack relies on how people read. Your brain predicts words instead of scanning each letter. When something looks familiar, you fill in the gaps automatically. On a large desktop monitor, a careful reader might spot the flaw. On a phone, the risk jumps. The address bar often shortens URLs, and the screen leaves little room for close inspection. That is exactly where attackers want you. Once trust is established, you are more likely to enter passwords, approve fake invoices or download harmful attachments.",
      "Common typosquatting variations to watch for",
      "Attackers rarely rely on a single trick. They mix several visual deceptions to increase their odds.",

      "microsoft.coUses a different domain ending to appear real",
      "What attackers do after you click",
      "Typosquatting domains like rnicrosoft.com are rarely used for a single purpose. Criminals reuse them across multiple scams. Common follow-ups include\u00a0credential phishing, fake HR notices and vendor payment requests. In every case, the attacker benefits from speed. The faster you act, the less likely you are to notice the mistake.",
      "Why these fake domains keep working",
      "Most people do not slow down to read URLs character by character. Familiar logos and language reinforce trust, especially during a busy workday. Mobile use makes this worse. Smaller screens, shortened links and constant notifications create perfect conditions for mistakes. This is not a Microsoft-only problem. Banks, retailers, healthcare portals and government services all face the same risk.",
      "How to stay safe from typosquatting attacks",
      "Typosquatting scams work because they rush you into trusting what looks familiar. These steps slow that moment down and help you spot fake domains before damage is done.",
      "Before clicking anything, open the full sender address in the email header. Display names and logos are easy to fake, but domains tell the real story. Look closely for swapped letters like rn in place of m, added hyphens or strange domain endings. If the address feels even slightly off, treat the message as hostile.",

      "On a desktop, hover your mouse over links to reveal the real destination. On a phone, long-press the link to preview the URL. This simple pause often exposes lookalike domains designed to steal logins. If the link does not match the exact site you expect, do not proceed.",
      "When an email claims your account needs urgent action, do not use its links. Instead, open a new browser tab and manually go to the official website using a saved bookmark. Legitimate companies do not require you to act through surprise links, and this habit cuts off most typosquatting attempts instantly.",
      "Strong antivirus software can block known phishing domains, flag malicious downloads and warn you before you enter credentials on risky sites. While it cannot catch every new typo trick, it adds an important safety net when human attention slips.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

Lawmakers, educators and child safety advocates want proof that AI companies can protect young users.

      "OpenAI announced tougher safety rules for teen users as pressure grows on tech companies to prove AI can protect young people online. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What OpenAI's new teen rules actually say",
      "OpenAI's updated Model Spec builds on existing safety limits and applies to teen users ages 13 to 17. It continues to block sexual content involving minors and discourages self-harm, delusions and manic behavior. For teens, the rules go further. The models must avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and violent or sexual roleplay, even when non-graphic. They must use extra caution when discussing body image and eating behaviors. When safety risks appear, the chatbot should prioritize protection over user autonomy. It should also avoid giving advice that helps teens hide risky behavior from caregivers. These limits apply even if a prompt is framed as fictional, historical, or educational.",
      "The four principles OpenAI says it uses to protect teens",
      "OpenAI says its approach to teen users follows four core principles:",

      "The company updated its chatbot guidelines for users ages 13 to 17 and launched new AI literacy tools for parents and teens. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Teens are driving the AI safety debate",
      "Gen Z users are among the most active chatbot users today. Many rely on AI for homework help, creative projects and emotional support. OpenAI's recent deal with Disney could draw even more young users to the platform. That growing popularity has also brought scrutiny. Recently, attorneys general from 42 states urged major tech companies to add stronger safeguards for children and vulnerable users. At the federal level, proposed legislation could go even further. Some lawmakers want to block minors from using AI chatbots entirely.",
      "Why experts question whether AI safety rules work",
      "Despite the updates, many experts remain cautious. One major concern is engagement. Advocates argue chatbots often encourage prolonged interaction, which can become addictive for teens. Refusing certain requests could help break that cycle. Still, critics warn that examples in policy documents are not proof of consistent behavior. Past versions of the Model Spec banned excessive agreeableness, yet models continued mirroring users in harmful ways. Some experts link this behavior to what they call AI psychosis, where chatbots reinforce distorted thinking instead of challenging it.",
      "In one widely reported case, a teenager who later died by suicide spent months interacting with a chatbot. Conversation logs showed repeated mirroring and validation of distress. Internal systems flagged hundreds of messages related to self-harm. Yet the interactions continued. Former safety researchers later explained that earlier moderation systems reviewed content after the fact rather than in real time. That allowed harmful conversations to continue unchecked. OpenAI says it now uses real-time classifiers across text, images, and audio. When systems detect serious risk, trained reviewers may step in, and parents may be notified.",
      "Some advocates praise OpenAI for publicly sharing its under-18 guidelines. Many tech companies do not offer that level of transparency. Still, experts stress that written rules are not enough. What matters is how the system behaves during real conversations with vulnerable users. Without independent measurement and clear enforcement data, critics say these updates remain promises rather than proof.",
      "How parents can help teens use AI safely",
      "OpenAI says parents play a key role in helping teens use AI responsibly. The company stresses that tools alone are not enough. Active guidance matters most.",
      "OpenAI encourages regular conversations between parents and teens about how AI fits into daily life. These discussions should focus on responsible use and critical thinking. Parents are urged to remind teens that AI responses are not facts and can be wrong.",
      "OpenAI provides parental controls that let adults manage how teens interact with AI tools. These tools can limit features and add oversight. The company says safeguards are designed to reduce exposure to higher-risk topics and unsafe interactions. Here are the steps OpenAI recommends parents take.",

      "Parents are encouraged to ask what teens use AI for, when they use it and how it makes them feel. These conversations can reveal unhealthy patterns early.",
      "Experts advise parents to look for increased isolation, emotional reliance on AI or treating chatbot responses as authority. These can signal unhealthy dependence.",

Another option sends 6-digit verification codes by text message through SMS or WhatsApp, depending on the country code. Enabling multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection beyond a password and helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access to teen accounts.",
      "Also, consider adding a strong antivirus software that can help block malicious links, fake downloads, and other threats teens may encounter while using AI tools. This adds an extra layer of protection beyond any single app or platform.\u00a0 Using strong antivirus protection and two-factor authentication together helps reduce the risk of account takeovers that could expose teens to unsafe content or impersonation risks.",

Still, policies on paper are not the same as behavior in real conversations. For teens who rely on AI every day, what matters most is how these systems respond in moments of stress, confusion, or vulnerability. That is where trust is built or lost. For parents, this moment calls for balance. AI tools can be helpful and creative. They also require guidance, boundaries, and supervision. No set of controls can replace real conversations or human support. As AI becomes more embedded in our everyday lives, the focus must stay on outcomes, not intentions. Protecting teens will depend on consistent enforcement, independent oversight, and active family involvement.",

      "Kurt 'The Cyber Guy' Knutsson shares his tips and tricks to avoid holiday shopping scams this winter season on 'Fox Report.'",
      "Data breaches tied to financial services companies are no longer rare, but they still hit harder when Social Security numbers are involved. In the latest incident, U.S.-based fintech company 700Credit has confirmed that the personal data of more than 5.8 million people was exposed. The breach did not originate from a direct compromise of 700Credit's internal network, which makes it more concerning. It began with a third-party integration partner and quietly snowballed over several months before it was detected. By the time the issue was contained, hackers had managed to steal a significant amount of sensitive consumer data.",

      "A data breach at fintech firm 700Credit exposed the personal information of more than 5.8 million people after hackers accessed data through a third-party vendor. (Photo by Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What went wrong at 700Credit",
      "The company says the breach traces back to July, when a threat actor compromised one of its third-party integration partners, as reported by Bleeping Computer. During that intrusion, the attacker discovered an exposed API that could be used to access customer information linked to 700Credit's dealership clients. The integration partner failed to inform 700Credit about the compromise, allowing the access to continue unnoticed.",
      "Suspicious activity was only detected on October 25, when 700Credit flagged unusual behavior on its systems and launched an internal investigation. The company says it brought in third-party computer forensic specialists to assess the scope of the incident and determine what data had been affected.",
      "According to the company's findings, certain records within its web application were copied without authorization. These records are related to customers of auto dealerships that use 700Credit's services. Managing Director Ken Hill later confirmed that roughly 20% of the consumer data accessible through the affected system was stolen between May and October.",
      "What data was exposed and why it matters",
      "While 700Credit has not published an exhaustive list of every data field involved, the company has confirmed that highly sensitive personal information was exposed. This includes Social Security numbers, which significantly raises the risk of identity theft and financial fraud. When SSNs are compromised, the impact is long-term. You cannot simply change them like a password.",
      "The company has published a dedicated page on its website outlining the breach and the types of information impacted. As part of its response, 700Credit is offering affected individuals 12 months of free identity protection and credit monitoring through TransUnion. You have a 90-day window to enroll in this service after receiving the notification.",
      "Notably, audio streaming platform SoundCloud and adult video sharing platform Pornhub also suffered data breaches tied to third-party vendors. There is no indication that the same vendor was involved in all three incidents, but the cases highlight how risky third-party access can be when vendors handle sensitive consumer data.",
      "CyberGuy reached out to 700Credit for comment but did not receive a response before publication.",

      "A good antivirus helps block malicious downloads, phishing links and spyware that often follow large data leaks. Attackers know your details are exposed and may try to target you directly with malware-based scams.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If you are still reusing passwords, this is the time to stop. A password manager helps you generate strong, unique passwords for every service and keeps them stored securely. If one site is breached, the rest of your accounts stay protected.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Turn on\u00a02FA\u00a0for email, banking, social media and cloud accounts. Even if someone has your password, they cannot log in without the second factor. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS, where possible.",
      "Monitoring services alert you when new accounts, loans or credit checks appear in your name. Early alerts give you a chance to act before serious financial damage is done.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Your phone number, address and other details are often already scattered across data broker sites. Data removal services help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for attackers to profile and target you after a breach.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Third-party APIs and integrations are essential for modern digital services, but they also expand the attack surface. When third-party partners fail to disclose breaches quickly, the downstream impact can be massive, as this case shows. If you receive a notification from 700Credit, take it seriously. Enroll in the credit monitoring service, review your credit reports, and consider locking them down. Even if no fraud has occurred yet, breaches involving SSNs often lead to delayed abuse months or even years later.",

      "FOX Business correspondent Max Gorden explains how Happy Returns is using artificial intelligence to audit legitimacy of customer returns on \u2018America Reports.\u2019",
      "Data from Happy Returns, a UPS-owned reverse logistics company, shows that nearly one in every 10 retail returns in the United States involves fraud. Retailers now lose an estimated $76.5 billion a year to the problem.",
      "To slow those losses, Happy Returns, which specializes in boxless in-store returns for online purchases, is testing a new artificial intelligence tool that flags fraudulent returns before refunds go out.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "NEW IPHONE SCAM TRICKS OWNERS INTO GIVING PHONES AWAY",
      "Return fraud is costing U.S. retailers billions, with nearly 1 in 10 returns flagged as suspicious, according to data from Happy Returns. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images)",
      "How return fraud works in the real world",
      "Return fraud often looks harmless on the surface. A shopper requests a refund for a legitimate item. Instead of sending back the real product, they ship something cheaper, damaged or completely different. Retailers often issue refunds before anyone inspects the item. That speed allows fraud to slip through and drives up costs.",
      "Industry data from Happy Returns and the National Retail Federation shows retailers will handle nearly $850 billion in returned goods in 2025, representing almost 16% of total retail sales. According to the same research, an estimated 9% of those returns are fraudulent. The report also finds that many shoppers admit to some form of return policy abuse. Importantly, because Happy Returns conducts in-person item verification and uses AI-powered automated flagging plus audit processes to catch mismatches, the rate of confirmed fraud in its network is much lower than the industry-wide estimate.",
      "Why boxless returns changed the equation",
      "Happy Returns operates nearly 8,000 in-person return drop-off locations inside stores such as Ulta Beauty and Staples, as well as at UPS locations. Shoppers can return eligible items without a box or shipping label, and refunds are often issued quickly after verification. Like any returns channel, fraud attempts can happen, but in-person drop-off, item verification, ongoing flagging and audits help keep confirmed fraud far lower than broader industry averages.",
      "Happy Returns says its boxless, in-person model already blocks many common fraud tactics, including empty boxes, partial returns and fake tracking numbers.\u00a0\"If you never touch the product, you can't actually know what's being returned matches what was sold,\" the company says. Everlane says that physical handling alone acts as a deterrent. \"Just the fact of knowing an individual will physically handle and verify the product at the Return Bar deters fraudsters from even attempting to commit fraud,\" said Jim Green, director of logistics and fulfillment at Everlane.",
      "Still, Happy Returns acknowledges that fraud tactics continue to evolve. Lookalike products and knockoffs can closely resemble the real thing, making subtle differences hard to spot without close inspection.",
      "THE FAKE REFUND SCAM: WHY SCAMMERS LOVE HOLIDAY SHOPPERS",
      "Happy Returns is testing a new artificial intelligence system designed to flag fraudulent retail returns before refunds are issued. (Photo By Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post via Getty Images)",
      "How Return Vision uses AI to detect fraudulent returns",
      "This holiday season, Happy Returns is piloting its new AI system with select retailers, including Everlane, Revolve and Under Armour, as return volumes spike.",
      "The new AI tool is called Return Vision. It starts working the moment a shopper initiates a return online. The system looks for unusual patterns across return timing, frequency and location. A single return may appear normal on its own. When those signals overlap in suspicious ways, the return is flagged for review before a refund is issued.",
      "At drop-off points, workers can scan item barcodes and see photos of what the item should look like. They can reject obvious mismatches on the spot. Once returns reach Happy Returns hubs in California, Pennsylvania and Mississippi, flagged packages are sent to human auditors. The items are opened and photographed, including images of the front, back and identifying labels.",
      "Those photos are fed back into the AI system, which compares them against official product images and past transaction data. Human teams review the AI assessment and make the final decision. The goal is not automation alone. It is adding multiple layers of review where fraud is harder to hide.",
      "Early results show how effective AI is at catching return fraud",
      "While still in pilot, Happy Returns says Return Vision is showing early results. Less than 1% of returns flowing through its network are flagged as high risk. Of those flagged returns, about 10% are ultimately confirmed as fraud. The average prevented loss per confirmed case is just over $200.",
      "Happy Returns says the system focuses on high-confidence cases, allowing most shoppers to move through returns without delay. The company notes that the tool does not address every form of abuse, such as wardrobing, when customers return worn items.",

      "Boxless, in-person returns are helping retailers cut down on common fraud tactics like empty boxes and fake tracking numbers. (Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why retailers are turning to AI to stop return fraud",
      "Happy Returns is not alone in turning to AI to stop return fraud. Amazon and FedEx both offer boxless returns and use automated systems to flag risky behavior. The U.S. Postal Service is rolling out similar services. Across retail, 85% of surveyed merchants say they use AI or machine learning to combat fraud. Many say the results have been mixed. Happy Returns says combining behavioral signals with physical product verification helps close gaps that data-only systems often miss.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Retail returns have changed, and so has the fraud that comes with them. Easy drop-offs and instant refunds made life better for shoppers, but they also created new vulnerabilities. Happy Returns is betting that AI, combined with hands-on inspection, can tip the balance back toward retailers. Early results suggest it can help, even if it is not a cure-all. As fraudsters adapt, retailers are learning they have to adapt faster.",

That earlier breach occurred after a\u00a0smishing attack gave threat actors access to Mixpanel systems. However, Mixpanel says it does not believe Pornhub data came from that incident. The company stated it found no evidence that the data was taken during its November 2025 breach. Pornhub has also clarified that it stopped working with Mixpanel in 2021. That means the stolen data would be several years old. Reuters contacted some Pornhub customers to verify the claims. Those users confirmed the data tied to their accounts was accurate but outdated, which aligns with the Mixpanel timeline.",

      "Apple Music is now available as an app inside ChatGPT, and it changes how people discover and organize music. Instead of scrolling through endless playlists, you can ask ChatGPT to create one using natural language. For example, you can request a holiday mix without overplayed songs or ask it to find a track you only half remember. ChatGPT searches Apple Music and builds the playlist for you. This integration does not stream full songs inside ChatGPT. It helps Apple Music subscribers find music, create playlists and discover artists faster, then links back to Apple Music for listening. ChatGPT can also activate Apple Music automatically based on your request, so you do not always need to select the app first.",

      "Stick to well-known apps from established companies. If an app name looks unfamiliar or feels rushed, skip it. When in doubt, research the app before connecting it to your ChatGPT account.",
      "Apps can change how they work after updates. Take a moment to review permissions if an app adds new features or requests additional access. This habit helps you spot changes early.",
      "Even trusted tools do not need your Social Security number, bank details or passwords. Keep chats focused on tasks and ideas. Treat ChatGPT like a public workspace, not a private vault.",
      "Your ChatGPT password should not match any other account. A password manager can help generate and store strong credentials. This step alone blocks many common attacks. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",

It also makes technology feel more helpful and less overwhelming. The best ChatGPT apps solve real problems, from discovering music to planning trips and choosing where to eat.

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Apple has released emergency security updates to fix two zero-day vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploited in highly targeted attacks.",
      "The company described the activity as an \"extremely sophisticated attack\" aimed at specific individuals. Although Apple did not identify the attackers or victims, the limited scope strongly suggests spyware-style operations rather than widespread cybercrime.",
      "Both flaws affect WebKit, the browser engine behind Safari and all browsers on iOS. As a result, the risk is significant. In some cases, simply visiting a malicious webpage may be enough to trigger an attack.",
      "Below, we break down what these vulnerabilities mean and explain how you can better protect yourself.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Apple released emergency updates after confirming two zero-day WebKit flaws were actively exploited in targeted attacks. (Reuters/Thomas Peter/File Photo)",
      "NEW IPHONE SCAM TRICKS OWNERS INTO GIVING PHONES AWAY",
      "What Apple says about the zero-day vulnerabilities",
      "The two vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2025-43529 and CVE-2025-14174, and Apple confirmed that both were exploited in the same real-world attacks. According to Apple's security bulletin, the flaws were abused on versions of iOS released before iOS 26, and the attacks were limited to \"specific targeted individuals.\"",
      "CVE-2025-43529 is a WebKit use-after-free vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution when a device processes maliciously crafted web content. To put it simply, it allows attackers to run their own code on a device by tricking the browser into mishandling memory. Apple credited Google's Threat Analysis Group with discovering this flaw, which is often a strong indicator of nation-state or commercial spyware activity.",
      "The second flaw, CVE-2025-14174, is also a WebKit issue, this time involving memory corruption. While Apple describes the impact as memory corruption rather than direct code execution, these types of bugs are often chained together with other vulnerabilities to fully compromise a device. Apple says this issue was discovered jointly by Apple and Google's Threat Analysis Group.",
      "In both cases, Apple acknowledged that it was aware of reports confirming active exploitation in the wild. That language is important because Apple typically reserves it for situations where attacks have already occurred, not just theoretical risks. The company says it addressed the bugs through improved memory management and better validation checks, without sharing deeper technical details that could help attackers replicate the exploits.",
      "Devices affected and signs of coordinated disclosure",
      "Apple has released patches across its supported operating systems, including the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Safari, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS.",
      "According to Apple's advisory, affected devices include iPhone 11 and newer models, multiple generations of iPad Pro, iPad Air from the third generation onward, the eighth-generation iPad and newer and the iPad mini starting with the fifth generation. This covers the vast majority of iPhones and iPads still in active use today.",
      "Apple has patched the flaws across its entire ecosystem. Fixes are available in iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2, iOS 18.7.3 and iPadOS 18.7.3, macOS Tahoe 26.2, tvOS 26.2, watchOS 26.2, visionOS 26.2 and Safari 26.2. Because Apple requires all iOS browsers to use WebKit under the hood, the same underlying issue also affected Chrome on iOS.",
      "6 steps you can take to protect yourself from such vulnerabilities",
      "Here are six practical steps you can take to stay safe, especially in light of highly targeted zero-day attacks like this.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Because WebKit powers Safari and all iOS browsers, even a malicious webpage may be enough to put unpatched devices at risk. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "This sounds obvious, but it matters more than anything else. Zero-day attacks rely on people running outdated software. If Apple ships an emergency update, install it the same day if you can. Delaying updates is often the only window attackers need. If you tend to forget about updates, let your devices handle them for you. Enable automatic updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS and Safari. That way, you are protected even if you miss the news or are traveling.",
      "Most WebKit exploits start with malicious web content. Avoid tapping on random links sent over SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram or email unless you are expecting them. If something feels off, open the site later by typing the address yourself.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you are a journalist, an activist or someone who deals with sensitive information, consider reducing your attack surface. Use Safari only, avoid unnecessary browser extensions, and limit how often you open links inside messaging apps.",
      "Apple's Lockdown Mode is designed specifically for targeted attacks. It restricts certain web technologies, blocks most message attachments, and limits attack vectors commonly used by spyware. It is not for everyone, but it exists for situations like this.",
      "Targeted attacks often start with profiling. The more personal data about you that is floating around online, the easier it is to pick you as a target. Removing data from broker sites and tightening social media privacy settings can lower your visibility.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Apple urges users to install the latest updates, especially those who may face higher-risk, targeted threats. (Cheng Xin/Getty Images)",
      "Unexpected crashes, overheating, sudden battery drain or Safari closing on its own can sometimes be warning signs. These do not automatically mean your device is compromised. However, if something feels consistently wrong, updating immediately and resetting the device is a smart move.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Apple has not shared details about who was targeted or how the attacks were delivered. However, the pattern fits closely with past spyware campaigns that focused on journalists, activists, political figures and others of interest to surveillance operators. With these patches, Apple has now fixed seven zero-day vulnerabilities that were exploited in the wild in 2025 alone. That includes flaws disclosed earlier this year and a backported fix in September for older devices.",

      "DoorDash wants to help you decide where to eat, not just how your food arrives. The company has launched Zesty, a new artificial intelligence-powered social app built to make finding local restaurants faster and easier.",
      "Zesty is now in public testing in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York. Instead of scrolling through endless reviews, menus and social videos, the app lets you ask an AI chatbot for recommendations in plain language.",
      "Think of it as a digital concierge for food discovery.",

      "How Zesty works",
      "Once you open Zesty and sign in with your DoorDash account, the experience feels familiar and simple. You see nearby restaurants and a chat box where you can type exactly what you want. DoorDash says users can ask prompts like:",
      "The app blends AI search with social discovery, showing photos, comments and saved spots shared by other diners. \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that's good for introverts",
      "Brunch spots good for groups",
      "Romantic dinner with a vintage feel",
      "The AI then curates recommendations by pulling information from DoorDash data, Google Maps, TikTok, Reddit and other sources. According to DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang, the goal is to surface the best suggestions from across the web in one place. Each recommendation includes context such as ratings, social buzz and where the suggestion came from. DoorDash says the results do not imply sponsorships or paid placements.",
      "A social network built around food",
      "Zesty also adds a social layer. Users can post photos, leave comments, follow other diners and share saved spots with friends. If you find a restaurant that looks promising, you can bookmark it for later or send it to someone planning dinner with you. This makes Zesty feel less like a search engine and more like a food-focused social network. It is designed for people who enjoy discovering places through other people's experiences, not just star ratings. For DoorDash, this is a clear shift toward community-driven discovery.",
      "Why DoorDash built Zesty",
      "DoorDash wants to remove friction from the decision process. Instead of bouncing among Google, TikTok, Yelp and delivery apps, Zesty aims to bring everything together in a single guided experience. That approach also aligns with a broader trend. More people already use AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to plan meals and trips. Zesty aims to offer that same convenience with a strong local and social focus.",
      "Zesty lets users ask for restaurant recommendations in natural language instead of scrolling through endless reviews and menus. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "\"At DoorDash, we're always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,\" a company spokesperson told CyberGuy. \"We're piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. Zesty is now in public beta in San Francisco and New York, and we're excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.\"",
      "Of course, Zesty faces an uphill climb. Many users already rely on Google Maps or existing social apps to find restaurants. Some may not want to download another standalone app, even if it promises better recommendations. Still, Zesty could appeal to users who enjoy food discovery as a social activity. For them, a dedicated network built around local dining may feel more useful than generic search results. DoorDash appears willing to test that idea and see how users respond.\u00a0For now, the company is focused on getting people to use the app, learning what works, and fine-tuning its matching engine. Once that experience feels right, Zesty will expand to more cities.",
      "WOULD YOU EAT AT A RESTAURANT RUN BY AI?",
      "Part of DoorDash's bigger expansion plan",
      "Zesty is not an isolated experiment. It fits into DoorDash's broader push beyond food delivery. Earlier this year, DoorDash rolled out features for in-person dining reservations and in-store rewards. The company also continues to invest heavily in automation and AI-driven logistics.",
      "We reported a few months ago on another major innovation from DoorDash: Dot, its fast new autonomous delivery robot. Dot is designed for short local trips and runs on an AI-powered delivery platform that decides whether an order should be handled by a Dasher, a robot or another method. Together, Zesty and Dot show how DoorDash is trying to own more of the local commerce experience, from discovery to delivery.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you enjoy trying new restaurants, Zesty could save you time and decision fatigue. Instead of reading dozens of reviews, you can ask for exactly what you want and get curated suggestions instantly. For casual diners, the app may feel unnecessary if Google already works fine. For food lovers who like sharing finds and following others with similar tastes, Zesty could become a useful daily tool. It also signals where local discovery may be heading. AI-driven recommendations paired with social proof could soon replace traditional review hunting.",

      "Zesty is now in beta in San Francisco and New York as DoorDash tests and refines its personalized matching experience. (iStock)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Zesty shows DoorDash experimenting with how people choose where to eat, not just how food gets delivered. By combining AI search with social sharing, the company is testing a more conversational and community-driven approach to local discovery. Whether Zesty becomes essential or stays niche will depend on how well it delivers meaningful recommendations. Still, it highlights DoorDash's growing ambition to shape more parts of our everyday local life.",

    "summary": "Harvard professor leaves after 40 years, alleges woke policies destroyed academic standards and excellence in scathing &quot;Why I&apos;m Leaving Harvard&quot; critique.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer discusses how President Donald Trump plans to cut $100 million in contracts for Harvard on \u2018The Will Cain Show.\u2019",
      "A history professor who taught at Harvard University for 40 years has left the Ivy League for greener pastures, penning a biting critique on the state of the school on his way out the door.",
      "In a piece titled \"Why I'm Leaving Harvard,\" published in Compact Magazine, history professor James Hankins said he decided in 2021 to leave the school amid a flurry of wokeness and COVID restrictions, but honored a four-year retirement contract that expired just weeks ago.",
      "\"We had just endured almost two years under the university\u2019s strict Covid regime,\" Hankins wrote. \"This was a form of emergency governance that mirrored to a fault the whole country\u2019s uncritical acceptance of The Science and its proclivity, when backed by public power, for tyrannous invasions of private life.\"",
      "He added that the school forced professors to lecture wearing masks and give seminars via Zoom, which did not comport with his views on education.",
      "History professor James Hankins taught at Harvard for 40 years. (Sophie Park/Bloomberg)",
      "FIVE HOPEFUL SIGNS COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE SEEKING TRUTH ONCE MORE",
      "Then, Hankins referenced the 2020 \"Summer of Floyd,\" when violent riots broke out nationwide after George Floyd died at the hands of police in Minneapolis. He said the university's response, which he thought would amount to \"empty virtue-signaling,\" turned out to be much more sinister, suggesting that discrimination against White men in graduate admissions became policy.",
      "\"In reviewing graduate student applicants in the fall of 2020 I came across an outstanding prospect who was a perfect fit for our program,\" wrote Hankins. \"In past years this candidate would have risen immediately to the top of the applicant pool. In 2021, however, I was told informally by a member of the admissions committee that 'that' (meaning admitting a white male) was 'not happening this year.'\"",
      "He described another instance of an even higher caliber student \u2014 one who had gone to Harvard as an undergraduate and had the highest overall academic record of anyone in his class and whom Hankins described as \"certifiably brilliant\" \u2014 being rejected by every Harvard graduate program to which he applied.",
      "MOST RADICAL COURSES, CURRICULUM THAT RECEIVED FEDERAL FUNDING IN 2025",
      "\"He too was a white male,\" Hankins wrote. \"I called around to friends at several universities to find out why on earth he had been rejected. Everywhere it was the same story: Graduate admissions committees around the country had been following the same unspoken protocol as ours.",
      "\"The one exception I found to the general exclusion of white males had begun life as a female,\" he continued.",
      "A Harvard spokesperson affirmed, as Hankins wrote in his piece, that graduate admissions are faculty-led and localized at the department level.",
      "But Hankins, who has now taken a role as a visiting professor at the University of Florida, didn't just critique the school over these particular examples. He also described how, during his 40-year tenure at the school, the history department, harangued by activists, has lowered academic standards and all but abandoned the Western canon and Western history alike.",

      "He explained that senior academic appointments at Harvard before the 1990s followed a \"two-book standard. Appointees were expected to have published two books, one typically a graduate or doctoral dissertation republished as a book, and another showcasing the academic's expertise on a given subject, before their appointments.",
      "\"The two-book standard would be shelved in the late 1990s when we were under increasing pressure to hire more women faculty,\" he wrote. \"Feminist activists, at Harvard as elsewhere, were demanding that half of all new appointments be women. That, they claimed, was what liberal standards of equality required.\"",
      "The feminist push had a devastating effect in the history department, according to Hankins.",
      "\"Since at the time women formed less than 10 percent of PhDs in history and were even rarer in the mid-career cohorts from which Harvard tended to hire, equality required that standards be lowered. Feminists denied vociferously that this was happening,\" he wrote.",
      "\"The real problem, they said, was the inability of men properly to value female scholarship,\" wrote Hankins, later adding that he and others who opposed the new order were labeled \"sexists.\"",

      "When the school began focusing on \"global civilizations\" and \"transnational history\" rather than Western civilization in the classroom, the disaffected professor fought back. He guided a two-semester course requirement that would first teach students about Western civilization, and then integrate non-Western civilization into their body of historical knowledge.",
      "HEAD OF AMERICA'S 'FREE ENTERPRISE' COLLEGE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ACADEMIA DESPITE LEFT-WING BIAS: 'THERE IS HOPE'",
      "That program was short-lived, lasting only through the early 2000s, when Hankins described continued and more rapid decline in academic standards.",
      "\"Soon the department was promoting an ever higher percentage of junior faculty,\" he wrote. \"The dynamic was similar to Congress voting to restrain its own spending. At one point we took a vow to curb promotions at 20 percent, then 50 percent. After that, there emerged an expectation that junior faculty would be promoted in the course of nature so long as they could get a book-length manuscript, or maybe a few really strong chapters, ready for publication in time for a tenure review.\"",
      "He described these newer and less qualified promotees as \"left-leaning,\" and said that \"countervailing winds\" at the university ushered in an institutional globalization, including more foreign students and the continued dwindling of Western history courses.",

      "James Hankins said Harvard has lowered its academic standards.",
      "\"'Transnational history' meant that Europeanists would no longer teach the internal history of European nations\u2014no more courses on the German Reformation, Elizabethan England, or the French Revolution,\" he said. \"Rather they would teach about interactions between Europe and the non-European world.\"",
      "Hankins later remarked that while professors of other history courses, like Chinese history, taught the jingoistic Chinese patriotism and the country's long and successful struggle against a colonial and suffocating West.",
      "However, such pride was not to be broached in Western history classes.",
      "\"Western global history, by contrast, displays no loyalty to Western societies or traditions; quite the contrary,\" he wrote. \"In the hands of hyper-progressive (or 'woke') practitioners, Western global history is often, indeed, actively anti-Western. Older Western societies are presented as inherently illiberal, to be contrasted unfavorably with the perfectly liberal society promised by the prophets of the progressive future.\"",

For now, a better hope lies in building new institutions unencumbered by the corruption and self-hatred that infect the old.\"",

      "Archive footage shows birth control education during the one-child policy era as Beijing now rolls out tax changes aimed at reversing population decline. (Credit: Reuters)",
      "China will begin charging a 13% value-added tax on contraceptives starting Jan. 1 while exempting childcare services from the same tax, a move authorities say is part of a broader effort to boost births as the country faces a sustained population decline, according to the BBC and The Associated Press.",
      "The tax overhaul, announced late last year, removes exemptions that had been in place since 1994, when China was still enforcing its decades-long one-child policy.",
      "Alongside the new tax on contraceptives such as condoms and birth control pills, the Chinese government is exempting childcare, marriage-related services and elderly care from the value-added tax (VAT), the BBC reported.",
      "Beijing has been pressing young people to marry and have children as it grapples with an aging population and a sluggish economy. Official figures show China\u2019s population has shrunk for three consecutive years with about 9.54 million babies born in 2024.",

      "A caregiver carries a baby in a woven basket in China as the government rolls out new tax and social policies aimed at encouraging families to have more children amid a population decline. (Cheng Xin/Getty Images)",
      "That figure is roughly half the number of births recorded a decade earlier, when China began easing limits on family size, according to national statistics cited by the BBC and the AP.",
      "China\u2019s population pressures have been mounting for years. Births fell from about 14.7 million in 2019 to roughly 9.5 million in 2024. In 2023, India officially overtook China as the world\u2019s most populous country.",
      "The new tax on contraceptives has drawn ridicule and concern inside China. On social media, some users joked about stockpiling condoms before prices rise, while others argued that the cost of contraception is insignificant compared with the expense of raising a child, the BBC reported.",
      "\"I have one child, and I don\u2019t want any more,\" Daniel Luo, a 36-year-old resident of Henan province, told the BBC. He said the price increase would not change his family plans, comparing it to small hikes in subway fares that do not alter daily behavior.",
      "Others worry the policy could have unintended consequences. Rosy Zhao, who lives in the central city of Xi\u2019an, told the BBC making contraception more expensive could lead students or people under financial strain to take risks. She called that the policy\u2019s most dangerous potential outcome.",
      "A SOLUTION TO THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM: MARRIAGE",
      "China reversed its controversial one-child policy in 2015. (Adek Berry)",
      "Health experts echoed those concerns in interviews with the AP, warning that higher prices could reduce access to contraception and contribute to more unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. China recorded more than 670,000 cases of syphilis and over 100,000 cases of gonorrhea in 2024, according to data from the National Disease Control and Prevention Administration.",
      "China has also reported some of the highest abortion numbers in the world. Between 2014 and 2021, authorities recorded between 9 million and 10 million abortions annually, according to the National Health Commission. China stopped publishing abortion data in 2022.",
      "Demographers and policy analysts remain skeptical that taxing contraceptives will meaningfully raise birth rates. Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, told the BBC the idea that higher condom prices would influence fertility decisions amounts to overthinking the policy.",
      "Value-added tax revenue, which totaled close to $1 trillion last year, accounts for about 40% of China\u2019s tax collection, according to figures cited by the BBC.",
      "Henrietta Levin of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) described the move as symbolic, reflecting Beijing\u2019s attempt to lift what she called strikingly low fertility numbers. She also cautioned that many incentives and subsidies depend on provincial governments that are already heavily indebted, raising questions about whether they can fund the measures adequately.",

      "A family of three takes a selfie at a shopping mall in Beijing as the Chinese government weighs options to increase the birth rate. (Yang Yuran/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)",
      "Public health experts interviewed by the AP said the policy could disproportionately affect women, who shoulder most responsibility for birth control in China. Research released by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2022 found condoms are used by about 9% of couples, while 44.2% rely on intrauterine devices and 30.5% on female sterilization. Male sterilization accounts for 4.7%.",
      "Some women say the tax revives resentment toward the government\u2019s long history of involvement in reproductive decisions. The Communist Party enforced the one-child policy from roughly 1980 until 2015 through fines, penalties and, in some cases, forced abortions, according to the AP. Children born outside the policy were sometimes denied household registration, effectively rendering them non-citizens.",
      "\"It is a disciplinary tactic, a management of women\u2019s bodies and my sexual desire,\" Zou Xuan, a 32-year-old teacher in Jiangxi province, told the AP.",
      "Concerns about further state intrusion have also surfaced in recent months. The BBC reported that women in some provinces have received calls from local officials asking about menstrual cycles and pregnancy plans. A health bureau in Yunnan province said the information was needed to identify expectant mothers, a move critics say risks alienating the very families Beijing hopes to encourage.",

      "CENTCOM said those forces conducted 11 follow-on missions between Dec. 20 and Dec. 29, killing at least seven ISIS members, capturing the remainder and eliminating four ISIS weapons caches. The operations followed Operation Hawkeye Strike, when U.S. and Jordanian forces hit more than 70 ISIS targets across central Syria using over 100 precision munitions, destroying infrastructure and weapons sites linked to the group.",

The country\u2019s transitional leadership, including President Ahmed al-Sharaa, emerged from armed Islamist factions that relied heavily on foreign fighters and militias, according to regional security assessments. While those groups are not synonymous with ISIS, experts say the incomplete dismantling of extremist networks has left gaps that ISIS cells continue to exploit.",

Kurdish officials have also raised concerns about funding shortages, manpower strain and pressure from rival militias operating nearby.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing intensifying political scrutiny after U.K. counterterrorism police began assessing resurfaced social media posts by Egyptian-British activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah, whom the prime minister had publicly welcomed back to Britain following his release from prison in Egypt.",
      "Abd El-Fattah was forced to apologize this week after the controversial posts published between 2008 and 2014 that included remarks endorsing violence against \"U.S. soldiers, Zionists and police.\" The posts resurfaced shortly after his return to the U.K., triggering political backlash and a counterterrorism review, including a tweet he wrote: \"From time to time I remind people that I rejoice when U.S. soldiers are killed, and support killing Zionists, even civilians.\"",
      "Abd El-Fattah returned to Britain on Boxing Day after receiving a pardon from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Starmer, who had campaigned publicly for his release and described the case as a priority for his government, said he was \"delighted\" when Abd El-Fattah arrived in the country.",

      "That welcome has since become a central point of controversy, although Starmer later condemned the historic posts as \"absolutely abhorrent\" and said the government was \"taking steps to review the information failures in this case.\"",
      "An official Counter Terrorism Policing spokesperson said authorities have received multiple public referrals related to Abd El-Fattah\u2019s historical posts and that they are now being assessed by specialist officers within the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU), according to GB News.",
      "GB News reported that the posts under review include material in which Abd El-Fattah allegedly described the killing of Zionists as \"heroic\" and appeared to call for violence against police. One post is reported to have stated, \"We need to kill more of them.\" Another post is alleged to have read: \"By the way I\u2019m a racist, I don\u2019t like white people so piss off.",
      "Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper ordered an urgent review into what she described as \"serious information failures\" in the case and said neither she nor Starmer were briefed on the social media posts before Abd El-Fattah arrived in Britain. Cooper said she \"very much regrets\" the government\u2019s public welcome and that it \"added to the distress felt by Jewish communities in the U.K.\"",

      "Speaking to Fox News Digital, Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, attacked the government\u2019s handling of the case, saying: \"The British Government is guilty of incompetence at the very least for having embraced an activist with such an obvious and appalling social media record.\"",
      "He continued, \"The fact that el-Fattah\u2019s public commentary was not checked by successive administrations allowing him access to first citizenship and consular support and then admission to the U.K. shows how shambolic our institutions have become. There is nothing British about this man beyond a quirk of administration, and he should be stripped of his status immediately and deported on account of who he really is: an enemy of this state.\"",

      "In his apology, Abd El-Fattah said the posts reflected \"expressions of a young man\u2019s anger and frustration in a time of regional crises,\" including wars in Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza, and rising police brutality in Egypt. He said he particularly regretted posts written during online disputes and acknowledged he \"should have known better.\"",

      "\"I was a cocky gregarious kid, a bit of a showman and a showoff even then,\" he wrote in his memoir \u2014 qualities he'd have the rest of his life.",
      "His bold personality and undeniably athletic skills helped him to become a legend in the table tennis world. In his biography, he talks about his love for gambling and betting \u2014 on himself.",
      "He won his first championship in 1946, becoming the United States Junior National Champion, a feat he repeated the next year.  He went on to win multiple others, including a United States Doubles Championship in 1949 and a Singles Championship in 1958.",
      "In 1997, when he was 67, he became the oldest person to win a national championship in a racket sport, per his obituary.",
      "He Started Playing the Game As a Child to Deal with Anxiety",
      "Reisman told several interviewers he began playing ping-pong as a child to deal with his debilitating anxiety.",
      "\u201cI had a nervous breakdown when I was 9 years old and ended up in Bellevue Hospital. Ping-Pong was the ultimate escape. My racket became a sensuous connection between the ball and my brain,\" he told Forbes for an interview published in 2005.",
      "By 13, Reisman had become a city junior champion, often hustling other players for money at Lawrence\u2019s Broadway Table Tennis Club in New York City, reported Forbes. When he was 16, he did a tour of England with a three-man exhibition team, wowing audiences with their paddle skills.",
      "As \"Marty Supreme\" depicts, Reisman worked briefly as a shoe salesman, his only foray into the 9-5 world. For the rest of his life, he relied on his ping-pong skills to make money, he told Forbes.",
      "\"No one has ever been less suited for regular employment than I was,\" he quipped.",
      "He Was Famous for Performing Flashy Tricks",
      "After Reisman learned audiences would pay to see him do tricks while playing ping-pong, he began appearing in special exhibitions.",
      "He and U.S. teammate Doug Cartland accepted an offer to be the opening act for three years for the basketball trickster the Harlem Globetrotters, delighting audiences by playing \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d using frying pans, according to his biography.",
      "Reisman's signature trick, which he showed off during a visit to \"The Late Night Show with David Letterman\" in 2008, was snapping a cigarette in half with a slam.",
      "\"No other player was willing to try it before a large audience. It can be embarrassing to miss four or five times in a row. It is impossible to explain the shot. It involves a communion between the racket, the ball, and the cigarette, and takes a great deal of confidence,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "He Was Obsessed with Being the Best at His Sport",
      "Reisman's goal was to be the best ping-pong player in the world. He talked about his passion for the sport in in his 1974 memoir \"The Money Player: The Confessions of America\u2019s Greatest Table Tennis Champion and Hustler.\"",
      "His earnings were enough to make him a three-time millionaire, fortunes he repeatedly lost, according to The New York Times.",
      "\u201cI took on people in the gladiatorial spirit,\u201d he told the Times in March 2012, just months before his death.",
      "He Was As Impish As Chalamet's Character",
      "Like Chalamet's character in Marty Supreme,\" Reisman was also a the bad boy of his sport.",
      "In 1949, Reisman traveled to the English Open where he and fellow American player Dick Miles traded their modest London hotel for swankier accommodations. The pair ran up a tab on room service and other luxuries, charging it all to the English Table Tennis Association, according to his memoir.",
      "When the English officials balked, refusing to pay the bill, Reisman and Miles said they wouldn't participate in their sold-out exhibition matches.",
      "The English officials ended up covering the costs but fined the men $200 and suspended them from sanctioned table tennis worldwide. Reisman wrote the sanction was lifted in 1950.",
      "Reisman Died in 2012",
      "Reisman died in December 2012 of complications of heart and lung ailments age 82, according to The New York Times.",
      "His death was announced by Table Tennis Nation, an organization Reisman founded in 2010.",
      "He was survived by his wife Yoshiko, a daughter, Debbie Reisman, and several grandchildren, per his obituary."

      "Isaac Fitzgerald's picks",
      "\"The Rest of Our Lives\" by Ben Markovits",
      "Isaac says: \"'The Rest of Our Lives' is a brilliantly humane and wildly absorbing story. Benjamin Markovits\u2019s magnetic prose feels both effortless and precise, as we follow Tom Layward who \u2014 after dropping his daughter off at college \u2014 just keeps driving. Here is a book that will find its home amongst the other great American road trip novels. An absolute triumph.\"",
      "\"On Morrison\" by Namwali Serpell",
      "Isaac says: \"'On Morrison' is a dazzling work of criticism.

This novel marks the emergence of an incredible new talent in Madeline Cash.\"",

Alongside beautiful illustrations by Lauren O\u2019Hara, Laufey\u2019s tender story offers a comforting message about growth, empathy, and finding joy in small moments.

Paula is one of our great American novelists, and 'Skylark' might be her best yet.\"",

      "Adriana says: \"In Father James Martin\u2019s forthcoming memoir, 'Work in Progress,' we really get to know the beloved priest and his journey to becoming a leader in the Catholic Church. This is a coming-of-age story perfect for all readers of all faiths: relatable, readable, and full of wisdom.\"",
      "\"Keeper of Lost Children\" by Sadeqa Johnson",

Set in post-WWII Germany, this novel visits an orphanage filled with the abandoned mixed-race children of German women and Black American GI\u2019s. This is an unknown history about love, resilience and identity.\"",
      "\"One Whole Hippopotamus\" by Carter Higgins",

      "The Grammy and Tony-winning actor, 38, has impressed fans all over the world with her voice, thanks in part to her role as Elphaba in \u201cWicked\u201d and sequel \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d over the last two years. Next up, she\u2019ll take on the challenge of starring in the West End production of \u201cDracula,\u201d where she will portray 23 different roles.",
      "Ahead of preparing for the show to premiere next year, Erivo spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about her busy schedule over the past few years and how she has preserved her voice.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always taking care of it,\u201d Erivo told the publication. She also shared that she is constantly in contact with vocal coaches Joan Lader and Antea Birchett and performs warmup exercises before all her performances.",
      "She added, \u201cI don\u2019t drink. I don\u2019t smoke. I\u2019m a crazy person. I don\u2019t eat anything on planes.\u201d",
      "Erivo then revealed one tip that keeps her vocal cords healthy: drinking tea.",
      "\u201cI bring everything with me: my tea, my water. Someone made a meme of the mug that I carry around because I have it with me everywhere,\u201d she continued. \u201cI have it in several different colors. I will not be without it because I want my tea to always be warm enough to hydrate me.\u201d",
      "She said the strict rules have become instinctive.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just how I exist. I will do whatever I need to make sure she\u2019s OK \u2014 except apparently take a break,\u201d she said.",
      "A break will have to wait. Erivo spoke with the outlet one day before her first full week of \u201cDracula\u201d rehearsals began. The musical, adapted and written by Kip Williams, will run from Feb. 4 to May 30, 2026 at the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre. It is described as an \u201cintoxicating, blood-pumping reimagining of the immortal gothic horror.\u201d",
      "Speaking about the demanding role, Erivo said, \u201cMy head is so full of information. It\u2019s not just the words, it\u2019s just not just the characters, it\u2019s the movement on stage with these characters, and the changes that happen on the stage with these characters. Costume changes are happening in real time in front of you; the character\u2019s becoming another character with a beat where there is no costume change; I\u2019m putting teeth in at the same time.\u201d",
      "Even though the actor has mastered many performances on the screen and stage, she said the show will be a new experience for her.",
      "\u201cThis is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever done before, and my brain is definitely being stretched to its limit,\u201d she shared.",
      "But, she said she knows when to say \u201cno\u201d if her constant schedule becomes too much.",
      "\u201cIf it feels like (an opportunity) might be something that I\u2019m going to have to learn from \u2014 this is really scary, this is going to force me to find something else in my character, something else in who I am \u2014 then I say yes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe problem is a lot of those things are showing up right now, so I\u2019m not saying no very often, but I do say no.\u201d",
      "In addition to her West End run, Erivo is also expected to be highlighted during the upcoming award season. She already scored a nomination for best film female actor \u2014 musical or comedy at the 83rd annual Golden Globe Awards, airing Jan. 11, for her portrayal of Elphaba in \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d"

      "The new year was less than two hours old when the fire that devoured the Le Constellation in the town of Crans-Montana was first reported around 1:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. ET Wednesday), Gisler said.",
      "Investigators are still probing the cause of the blaze. But Beatrice Pilloud, the Valais canton attorney, said they don\u2019t believe the fire was caused by an explosion, although the \u201cmain and working assumption is that a general fire caused an explosion.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt no moment is there a question of any kind of attack,\u201d said Pilloud. \u201cAn investigation has been launched, not against anyone, but to shed light on the circumstances surrounding this tragic fire.\"",

      "But Axel Clavier, a 16-year-old from Paris who survived the fire, told the AP he saw waitresses in the bar with Champagne bottles with sparklers just before the inferno erupted.",

      "NBC News verified footage posted to social media that showed the building ablaze, with thick smoke billowing into the air as crowds gathered around and some people ran toward the scene. Screaming could be heard in the background.",
      "Another video posted to TikTok showed emergency services on scene in the aftermath of the blaze and the area sealed off with police tape.",
      "Martin Meul, a reporter for Swiss German-language daily newspaper Blick, told NBC News\u2019 British broadcasting partner Sky News that he was in a restaurant next door to Le Constellation when the fire broke out.",
      "\u201cI went out to see what happened, and a lot of people were screaming and it was horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people were trying to escape through the main door. I saw a lot of people on the floor, and I think these people were dead.\u201d",
      "Parmelin, whose first day in office was on Thursday, wrote on X that the government\u2019s \u201cthoughts go to the victims, to the injured and their relatives, to whom it addresses its sincere condolences.\u201d What was meant to be a moment of joy turned into one of mourning, he added.",
      "Out of respect for victims\u2019 families, Parmelin delayed a traditional New Year\u2019s address to the nation meant to be broadcast Thursday afternoon, Swiss broadcasters SRF and RTS reported.",

    "summary": "Russia launched more than 200 drones at Ukraine as new year struck, while Putin and Zelenskyy offered messages to their nations.",
    "story": [
      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Russia rang in the new year by launching more than 200 drones at Ukraine, while President Vladimir Putin used his year-end address to rally support for his troops and to assure his nation of victory.",
      "In Ukraine itself, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Dec. 31 address was defiant but also optimistic about the frenetic shuttle diplomacy being brokered by the United States.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russia, whose officials are also in talks with the Americans, remains the central barrier to peace, with Putin unyielding in his maximalist demands.",
      "\u201cI would give anything in the world if, in this address, I could say that peace will also come in just a few minutes,\u201d Zelenskyy said just before the clock struck midnight. \u201cUnfortunately, I cannot say that yet. But with a clear conscience, I \u2014 all of us \u2014 can say that Ukraine is truly doing everything for peace.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader recently returned from a meeting with President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday. Afterward, Zelenskyy said Trump had offered 15 years of the crucial \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d that he says are essential to stop Putin from attacking again. Ukraine had asked for 50 years, he said.",
      "Hours before the new year\u2019s bells chimed, Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff posted on X that he had held a call with Zelenskyy, Ukrainian national security secretary Rustem Umerov and the national security advisers of Britain, France and Germany.",
      "In his own post on X, Umerov said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner were also on the call.",
      "Though Zelenskyy said that the \u201cpeace agreement is 90% ready,\u201d he suggested that the remaining 10% contained the thorniest issues preventing peace.",
      "\u201cThose are the 10% that will determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live,\u201d he said. \u201cTen percent to save millions of lives. Ten percent of the determination needed for peace to work 100%. Ten percent of the unity and wisdom so desperately needed \u2014 Ukrainian, American, European, from the entire world. Ten percent to peace.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader charted what has been a roller-coaster year trying to retain the goodwill of Trump, a pivotal and changeable figure in the peace process. Zelenskyy said \u201cit was not easy at all to achieve such a change in the tone of relations between Ukraine and the United States\u201d after he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance in an extraordinary White House meeting in February.",
      "Trump has often shifted between appearing to favor Russia and then Ukraine during these negotiations, and has at various points been criticized for freezing Ukraine and Europe out of the process.",
      "\u201cWithout Ukraine, nothing will work. Ukraine has defended its right to have a voice,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding later: \u201cUkraine is, in fact, the only shield that now separates Europe\u2019s comfortable way of life from the Russian world.\u201d",
      "Hours after Zelenskyy spoke, Russia launched 205 drones \u2014 mostly Iran-designed Shaheds along with some Russian Gerbera drones \u2014 into Ukraine, according to the country\u2019s military. Air defense systems downed 176 of these, but 24 strikes were recorded at 15 locations, it said. There was also shelling right along the line of contact between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "At least two people were killed and more than a dozen injured across the country, according to regional officials.",
      "For its part, Ukraine launched a strike against Russia\u2019s Rosrezerv oil depot in the Yaroslavl region, the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said in a statement. The SBU said this was the latest strike designed to \u201ccut off the supply chains of Russian petroleum products with surgical precision, both abroad and for the troops attacking Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Russia claimed this week that Ukraine had attempted to assassinate Putin with a drone strike on his country residence, something that Ukraine denied and the CIA concluded was not true, a source with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",
      "In his own New Year\u2019s address, Putin said his country was striving \u201cto bring joy and warmth\u201d to those in need, as well as the \u201cheroes\u201d fighting in Ukraine. \u201cI wish all our soldiers and commanders a happy new year! We believe in you and in our victory,\u201d he said.",

      "Artemis II launch",
      "2026 is the year NASA finally returns to the moon \u2014 sort of.",
      "The Artemis II mission, the next step in NASA\u2019s return-to-the-moon program, is expected to launch sometime from February to April. The flight will be a key test of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. The mission will send four astronauts on a roughly 10-day journey around the moon to evaluate how the Orion spacecraft\u2019s various systems and hardware function in a deep space environment.",
      "The mission will be the first crewed flight of the Artemis program, and it will take the astronauts to the closest point humans have come to the moon in more than 50 years, since the end of the Apollo program.",
      "It will be closely watched, particularly as the Trump administration has repeatedly talked about the need to return to the moon before China lands its astronauts on the lunar surface. Much of that vision hinges on the outcome of the Artemis II mission.",
      "If it succeeds, the flight will pave the way for the Artemis III mission, which is expected to land astronauts near the moon\u2019s south pole. In a recent executive order, President Donald Trump directed NASA to return astronauts to the moon by 2028 \u201cto assert American leadership in space, lay the foundations for lunar economic development, prepare for the journey to Mars, and inspire the next generation of American explorers.\u201d",

The GOP\u2019s defense of its Senate majority is likely to be easier, as Democrats need to net four more seats there, and most of that battlefield runs through states Trump won in 2024.",

      "Despite bombs raining down and a lack of tools, feed and medicine, the shelter has remained operational throughout the two-year conflict, working to help emaciated and injured dogs, cats, donkeys and horses.",
      "At the shelter\u2019s site in Deir al-Balah, several dogs with three legs are among the animals running around, a stark reminder of the toll that the war has taken. In a large tent, veterinarians and volunteers work together to place an IV into the leg of a small, whimpering puppy.",
      "Dr. Hossam Mortaja, one of the few remaining veterinarians in Gaza, is often forced to improvise, using expired medicines or human drugs like amoxicillin when veterinary supplies run dry.",
      "\u201cAnimals suffer like humans \u2014 they feel fear, even convulsions,\u201d he said. The organization shelters about 70 dogs and 50 cats, many injured or left without owners by the war. During the worst aid shortages, the team shared scarce rice, pasta and canned tuna with the animals, a desperate measure to prevent starvation.",
      "Since the war erupted in October 2023, Gaza\u2019s animal population has plummeted. According to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, an estimated 97% of the strip\u2019s livestock has been destroyed through bombing, starvation and looting. This includes cows, sheep, goats and poultry.",
      "Large animals like donkeys and horses have dropped to around 30% of their former numbers.",
      "Stray pets have not been spared; countless dogs and cats were abandoned as families fled, leading to a surge in malnutrition, diseases like parvovirus, anemia and respiratory infections. Veterinary reports describe animals in states of \u201ccachexia\u201d \u2014 severe wasting \u2014 with weakened immune systems exacerbating outbreaks of gastroenteritis, jaundice and eye diseases. Sulala\u2019s clinic treats these conditions daily.",
      "\u201cPeople seek comfort in animals. Some find support in dogs, while others find it in cats. During the war, I witnessed many individuals caring for and sheltering animals, both cats and dogs. They reached out to us, and we consistently provided them with food,\u201d Al-Aar told NBC News.",
      "The Sulala Animal Rescue team worked in dire and dangerous conditions as Israel continued its assault on Gaza. Famine conditions in Gaza City have eased since the ceasefire began in October, according to a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world\u2019s leading authority on food crises, but the situation remains critical, with the entire strip still at risk of starvation.",
      "Veterinarian Muath Talat Abo Rokba, who worked with Sulala and also ran his own veterinary clinic, was reportedly killed by Israeli forces in October, while the ceasefire was in effect. He had been visiting the ruins of his home in the Jabalia area, close to the \u201cyellow line\u201d marking Israeli-held territory, Sulala Animal Rescue said at the time. The IDF told NBC News that it was not aware of the specific incident.",
      "\u201cThere are no words we have about losing him,\u201d said Annelies Keuleers, a remote volunteer and spokesperson for Sulala Animal Rescue. \u201cIn many ways, he was absolutely irreplaceable.\u201d",
      "The shelter\u2019s Instagram page has attracted a dedicated following amid the conflict, with 180,000 followers, many of whom are located in the West, eagerly watching for updates on Al-Aar, his team and the animals the organization helps.",
      "Keuleers, who volunteers from Belgium, told NBC News that she worries constantly for the safety of the rescue team on the ground.",
      "\u201cSaeed and his children have been in dangerous situations to try and pick up animals that have been left behind during evacuations, that have been starving there.\u201d",

      "A firsthand account of an explosion along the Venezuelan coast on Dec. 18 is raising questions about who may have been responsible for the attack and whether it was connected to the U.S.\u2019 escalating pressure campaign against the South American country.",
      "The arid coastal strip in the northwest of Venezuela, known as Alta Guajira, is heavily controlled by the National Liberation Army, or Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (ELN) in Spanish, an armed guerilla group known for its history of drug trafficking that is also active in neighboring Colombia.",

      "NBC News reporting has not established a link between the explosion described by Trump and the explosion described by the eyewitnesses in northwest Venezuela.",
      "The apparent attack follows months of U.S. military pressure, including dozens of strikes on boats in international waters. The White House has claimed that the boats carried drugs, though officials have not provided evidence.",

      "Pressed about the attack Monday at a media availability session at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, Trump said it was a \u201cmajor explosion\u201d in a dock area along Venezuela\u2019s shoreline where boats were loaded with drugs.",
      "The CIA has declined to comment on reports that it conducted a drone strike last week at a port facility in Venezuela. The White House has also declined to comment beyond Trump\u2019s remarks on anything related to possible land strikes in Venezuela.",

She said she was fishing for dinner along with relatives when the explosion destroyed the hut.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Ana said, noting that the explosion was so loud that she and her relatives were unable to hear for hours.

      "According to Ana, representatives from the Venezuelan government showed up the morning after she heard the blast \u2014 around 10 a.m. Dec. 19. She said local residents asked them for help, for a doctor to check on the hearing problems and for new fishing nets and hammocks, which had also been blown up.",
      "Ana said one of government representatives blamed the U.S. and said: \u201cThe gringos did this.\u201d",
      "NBC News asked the Venezuelan government for comment and did not immediately receive a response. It is not clear who was responsible for the Dec. 18 explosion.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to be alive,\u201d Ana said. \u201cBut we\u2019re scared.\u201d",

      "With details so scarce, Trump\u2019s comments have touched off a wave of speculation inside Venezuela about the U.S.\u2019 target. For days, local news reports and videos on social media have circulated of a explosion last Wednesday in Maracaibo, a major port city.",

      "The protests erupted Sunday and gathered pace Monday after the Islamic Republic\u2019s currency, the rial, hit a record low against the dollar. Many in Iran are already struggling with the cost of living, and rising prices have fueled concerns about potential hyperinflation.",

      "According to the state statistics center, the inflation rate in December rose to 42.2% from the same period last year and is 1.8% higher than in November. Food prices rose 72% and health and medical items were up 50% from December last year, according to the statistics center. Many critics see the rate as a sign of approaching hyperinflation.",

      "The protests began among shopkeepers and traders in Tehran, with state media reporting that many stores around the Grand Bazaar were closed Monday as hundreds gathered.",
      "The currency drop and fluctuating prices saw traders selling imported goods particularly affected.",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian acknowledged the country\u2019s deep economic woes in a message posted to X on Monday. He said he had instructed the minister of interior to meet with representatives from the protesters in order to hear their concerns and try to solve their problems.",

      "Authorities announced a shutdown would take place Wednesday in Tehran and a number of other provinces across the country, citing cold weather and the need to maintain energy supplies.",
      "The demonstrations appeared to be the largest in the Islamic Republic since the Woman, Life, Freedom protests in 2022 and 2023, which posed a serious challenge to the Iranian government and only dwindled after a harsh crackdown from security forces that led to the death of some 500 people and the arrest of thousands.",

He said Hamas, which didn\u2019t agree to the demilitarization of Gaza that Trump laid out as a key point in his peace plan, will be given a \"very short period of time\" to disarm.",
      "If it doesn't, Trump said, the consequences will be \"horrible.\" He suggested that other countries \u2014 not necessarily the U.S. or Israel \u2014 would take action against the perpetrators of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were abducted.",
      "\"If they say they\u2019re not going to disarm, those same countries will go and wipe them out,\" Trump said.",
      "Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 70,000 people since the war started, the Palestinian Health Ministry said in late November. The death toll has continued to rise despite the ongoing ceasefire.",
      "Trump was overwhelmingly supportive Monday of Israel's efforts to advance the peace plan. He said that Israel had \"lived up to the plan 100%\" and that he wasn\u2019t concerned \"about anything that Israel is doing.\"",
      "Asked moments later whether he was concerned that Israeli settler violence could undermine the peace plan, Trump said he and Netanyahu weren\u2019t on the same page about the West Bank.",
      "\"We have had a discussion, big discussion, for a long time on the West Bank. And I wouldn't say we agree on the West Bank 100%. But we will come to a conclusion on the West Bank,\" he said.",
      "Trump didn\u2019t elaborate on what the leaders' differences were, but he said he believes Netanyahu will \"do the right thing.\"",
      "Ahead of their closed-door meeting at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump told reporters that they would discuss the need for Hamas to disarm, Iran's ballistic missile and nuclear programs, and Syria's new government.",
      "Standing alongside him at the top of the meeting, Netanyahu praised Trump.",
      "\"I'll say it again and again and again, we\u2019ve never had a friend like President Trump in the White House. It\u2019s not even close,\" he said. \"And I think you can judge that by not merely by the frequency of our meetings, but by the content and the intensity.\"",
      "Trump responded: \"Well, I just want to say that it\u2019s very important who the prime minister and president of Israel is. We have a great relationship.",
      "\"He can be very difficult on occasion, but you need a strong man,\" Trump added. \"If you had a weak man, you wouldn\u2019t have Israel right now. Israel would have been, you know, Israel, with most other leaders, would not exist today.\"",
      "Netanyahu reiterated his praise of Trump after their meeting, announcing that Israel would award him the Israel Prize, the country's highest honor. Netanyahu said it would be the first time the prize has been awarded to a non-Israeli.",
      "Monday's meeting comes one day after Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago as part of the U.S. bid to negotiate a peace deal with Russia.",
      "While Trump has been working for an end to the war in Europe, progress in the Middle East has stalled.",
      "The Israel-Hamas truce went into effect in October, ending the two-year conflict in Gaza that followed the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "But there has been little movement on the more complex second phase of the peace process, raising concerns that both sides are failing to take action to carry out the next phase.",
      "More than 400 people have been killed in the Palestinian enclave since that agreement, local officials say, while Israel has accused Hamas of ceasefire violations, including the delayed return of hostage remains \u2014 with one body still to be handed over.",
      "The U.N. Security Council gave its approval to Phase 2 of Trump\u2019s 20-point peace plan last month, under which Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and Hamas would give up its weapons.",
      "But few details have been publicly confirmed about the \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d headed by Trump, which would help oversee the territory's governance, or the International Stabilization Force that would be deployed to Gaza."

      "Russia on Monday promised to retaliate against Ukraine after it said nearly 100 drones had targeted one of President Vladimir Putin's residences, likely throwing a wrench into President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to end the nearly four-year war.",
      "\"Such reckless actions will not go unanswered. The targets for retaliatory strikes and the timing of their implementation by the Russian armed forces have been determined,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said without offering details of the alleged attacks in the region of Novgorod.",
      "Soon after, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the claims a lie aimed at jeopardizing negotiations. Russia would most likely use the alleged attack to launch strikes at government buildings in Kyiv, the capital, he added.",
      "Trump later told reporters that he \"just heard\" about the attack alleged by Russia.",
      "\u201cThat would be too bad. That would not be good,\u201d he said ahead of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",

      "The Ukrainian leader said Trump was now offering Kyiv legally binding security guarantees that would last for 15 years, though he had asked for them to remain in place for up to half a century.",
      "\u201cI told him that we have been at war for almost 15 years, and therefore we would very much like the guarantees to be longer,\u201d Zelenskyy said, referring to Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and backing of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine\u2019s east before a full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "He said Trump indicated he would consider longer guarantees, adding that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the \u201cpresence\u201d of partners.",

      "Ukraine still controls a chunk of Donbas and has vowed it won't give up that land, but Russia wants the whole region \u2014 a major demand that Putin has shown no desire to compromise on. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe\u2019s largest, is occupied by Russia but each side wants control of it in a deal.",
      "American negotiators have previously floated the concept of establishing a \u201cfree economic zone\u201d in Donbas, but Zelenskyy said Monday there is \u201cno detailed concept\u201d of how that would work yet, and that Ukrainian society would need to be consulted on any such agreement.",
      "In fact, he said the whole 20-point peace plan should be put to a referendum in Ukraine, which he said would require a ceasefire of at least 60 days.",

      "There now appear to be signals from the Ukrainian camp that Kyiv may be prepared to compromise with Moscow.",
      "Zelenskyy said Sunday in a Telegram post that \u201cmuch can be decided before the New Year,\u201d but \u201cwhether decisions will be made depends on our partners.\u201d",
      "Last week, he outlined elements of an updated proposal that would see Ukraine potentially withdraw troops from parts of the east without recognizing captured areas as Russian territory, with a demilitarized zone established in their place.",
      "Such suggestions had previously appeared to be red lines in peace talks. Until Tuesday, Zelenskyy had maintained that he would be unwilling to withdraw troops from the country\u2019s eastern industrial heartland, much of which has been occupied by Russian forces, as part of any plan to end the war.",
      "But he has remained firm on another issue.",
      "Zelenskyy said the question of U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, aimed at preventing further Russian incursions, would ultimately depend on the U.S. president.",
      "\u201cFor us, it is very important that there is a signal that we want legally binding security guarantees,\u201d Zelenskyy told Ukrainian journalists in a Q&A session via WhatsApp on Saturday. \u201cThis primarily depends on President Trump. The question is what security guarantees President Trump is ready to provide to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "That said, Ukraine\u2019s history underscores the dangers of relying on security assurances as a long-term solution. The Budapest Memorandum, signed in 1994 in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons, committed the U.S. and Russia to respecting Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.",
      "It was shattered in 2014 with Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and incursions in eastern Ukraine, followed by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago, which sparked the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II.",
      "It remains unclear whether Zelenskyy\u2019s optimism is widely shared. He presented a united front with European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney after meetings on Saturday, though there was little sign of an imminent breakthrough.",
      "While European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said countries would work toward a \u201cshared objective,\u201d divisions have blown up in recent weeks over since-dropped plans to hand seized Russian assets to Ukraine.",
      "And it\u2019s unclear how Russian President Vladimir Putin, and even Trump himself, will ultimately respond to Zelenskyy\u2019s latest peace offerings.",
      "Putin told some of Russia\u2019s top businessmen that he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces in Ukraine, but that he wanted full control of the Donbas region, the Kommersant newspaper reported on Friday.",
      "\u201cVladimir Putin asserted that the Russian side is still ready to make the concessions that he made in Anchorage. In other words, that \u2018Donbas is ours,\u2019\u201d Kommersant reported. In essence, Putin wants the whole of Donbas, though outside that area \u201ca partial exchange of territories from the Russian side is not ruled out,\u201d wrote columnist Andrei Kolesnikov.",
      "Such hard-line demands, held by Putin throughout the conflict, still appear well at odds with Zelenskyy\u2019s pathway to peace.",
      "While demilitarized zones remain a possibility, Zelenskyy said Ukraine and the United States have not found common ground on demands that Ukraine cede the parts of Donbas it still controls.",
      "After heavy Russian strikes hit Kyiv across the weekend, killing two and injuring dozens more, Zelenskyy said Saturday that Putin is not interested in peace, accusing him of seeking to prolong the war and \u201cuse every opportunity to cause Ukraine even greater suffering.\u201d",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has remained publicly noncommittal. Asked about Zelenskyy\u2019s visit, he told Politico: \u201cWe will see what he\u2019s got.\u201d",
      "A Ukrainian official familiar with the planning for Sunday\u2019s meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump told NBC News that in addition to security guarantees for Ukraine, the Ukrainians are preparing to discuss economic prosperity and reconstruction of the war-torn country.",

He did not provide a cause of death, and said no arrangements have yet been made for funeral or memorial services. She had been hospitalized last month after a period of ill health.",
      "Leading tributes, French President Emmanuel Macron said Bardot \u201cembodied a life of freedom\u201d and lived a \u201cFrench existence.\u201d Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally party, which Bardot publicly supported in her later years, referred to her as a \u201cpassionate patriot\u201d who represented \u201can entire era of French history.\u201d",

      "But a month later, in November 2025, Bardot was hospitalized again for what French news outlets described a \u201cserious\u201d health issue.",

      "The provocative French melodrama about a voluptuous teenager who scandalizes Saint-Tropez was a box office smash both abroad and in the United States, despite mixed critical reviews and condemnation by watchdog groups like the National Legion of Decency.",
      "Dubbed a \u201csex kitten\u201d by British film producer Tony Tenser, Bardot broke through as the so-called sexual revolution was underway, women were embracing birth control, and many moviegoers were searching for racier fare.",

      "Bardot was box office gold and even won critical acclaim for her turns in internationally produced movies like \u201cThe Truth\u201d (1960) and \u201cViva Maria!\u201d (1965). But she mostly steered clear of Hollywood, although she did play herself in the 1965 comedy \u201cDear Brigitte.\u201d",
      "Bardot did not think much of her own acting.",
      "\u201cI started out as a lousy actress and have remained one,\u201d she reportedly said, according to The Guardian.",
      "Bardot also recorded some 60 pop songs in the 1960s and 1970s, many of them in collaboration with French singer Serge Gainsbourg, with whom she had an affair while married to her third husband, German millionaire Gunter Sachs.",
      "One of Bardot\u2019s best-known musical forays was a cover of Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cYou Are the Sunshine of My Life\u201d with French singer Sacha Distel.",
      "By her own admission, Bardot\u2019s personal life was tempestuous.",
      "Her marriage to Vadim began falling apart on the set of \u201cAnd God Created Woman\u201d when she embarked on an affair with her co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant.",
      "It was one of many infidelities that Bardot has admitted to over the years.",
      "Two years later, Bardot married actor Jacques Charrier, with whom she had her only child \u2014 a son named Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, who was born in January 1960.",
      "Bardot, in her memoir, wrote that she was \u201cnot made to be a mother.\u201d She wrote that her unborn child was like a \u201ccancerous tumor\u201d that she tried to remove by punching herself in the stomach.",
      "When that marriage broke up after three years, Charrier got custody of their son.",
      "Father and son later sued Bardot for the \u201churtful remarks\u201d in the memoir and were awarded $36,200 in damages.",
      "Bardot and her son, who lives in Norway, later reconciled. And she met her grandchildren and great-granddaughter.",
      "Her three-year marriage to Sachs in 1966 was also marked by multiple infidelities, but it ended in an amicable divorce.",
      "\u201cA year with Bardot was worth 10 with anyone else,\u201d Sachs reportedly said after the marriage was over.",
      "Bardot, in public statements, rarely revisited her acting career once it was over. In a 2007 interview, she appeared to be at a loss when asked how she came to be an icon of French cinema.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that I arrived and left at the right time. My wild and free side unsettled some, and unwedged others.\u201d"

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is en route to the U.S. via Canada ahead of a weekend of high-stakes diplomacy and a renewed push for peace amid deadly Russian bombing on Ukraine\u2019s capital.",
      "Zelenskyy is set to meet with President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday, after a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and phone calls with European leaders Saturday.",
      "As Trump ups pressure to bring the war to an end, Zelenskyy said that the critical issue of U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, to prevent a further Russian incursion, would hinge on the U.S. president.",
      "\u201cFor us, it is very important that there is a signal that we want legally binding security guarantees,\u201d Zelenskyy told Ukrainian journalists in a Q&A session via WhatsApp on Saturday. \u201cThis primarily depends on President Trump. The question is what security guarantees President Trump is ready to provide to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "If Russia \u201cturns even the Christmas and New Year period into a time of destroyed homes and burned apartments, of ruined power plants, then this sick activity can only be responded to with truly strong steps,\u201d he posted on X earlier as he embarked on the trip. \u201cThe United States has this capability. Europe has this capability.\u201d",
      "In addition to meeting with Trump and Carney, Zelenskyy said he would talk remotely with European leaders to \u201cexchange the details of the documents I will be discussing with the President of the United States.\u201d",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will attend the online meeting, a European Commission spokesperson told NBC News.",
      "European leaders have largely been sidelined in the main negotiations between the U.S., Ukraine and Russia.",
      "They have focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. But longtime American allies in Europe have struggled to balance mounting pressure from Washington with their reluctance to give in to Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "A Ukrainian official familiar with the planning for Sunday\u2019s meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump told NBC News that in addition to security guarantees for Ukraine, the Ukrainians are preparing to discuss economic prosperity and reconstruction of the war-torn country.",
      "There are also talks of holding a joint news conference with Trump and Zelenskyy, not necessarily to announce anything new, but to discuss the results of the meeting, the Ukrainian official said.",
      "In a WhatsApp chat with Ukrainian journalists on Friday, Zelenskyy said, \u201cThe 20-point plan we have been working on is 90% ready,\u201d and negotiating teams in Ukraine and the U.S. had made \u201csignificant progress.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur task is to make sure everything is 100% ready,\u201d he added. \u201cWith each such meeting and each such conversation, we must bring the desired result closer.\u201d",
      "Trump has made a high-level diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into Moscow\u2019s and Kyiv\u2019s widely differing positions and demands, while Russia remains unrelenting in its offensive.",
      "Heavy Russian shelling and explosions struck Kyiv and the surrounding region early Saturday morning, killing at least two people and injuring 20 more, according to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, who added that more than 10 residential buildings in the city had been damaged.",
      "The strikes caused the temporary closure of two airports in southeastern Poland after the Polish air force scrambled fighter jets, the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency said on X.",
      "Zelenskyy said Saturday that 500 Russian drones and 40 missiles had struck the nation.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched a full-scale invasion of Russia\u2019s much smaller neighbor in February 2022, has not backed off maximalist demands that would see Ukraine blocked from integrating with the West and limit its ability to defend itself. Until Tuesday, Zelenskyy had maintained that he would be unwilling to withdraw troops from the country\u2019s eastern industrial heartland, much of which has been occupied by Russian forces, as part of a plan to end the war.",
      "The Ukrainian leader has since given details of an updated peace plan offering Russia the potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarized zone in their place.",
      "Trump told Politico Friday that he anticipated a \u201cgood\u201d meeting with the Ukrainian leader, though he offered no endorsement of Zelenskyy\u2019s plan.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything until I approve it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see what he\u2019s got.\u201d"
