      "VERSAILLES, France -- A long-lost painting by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens, which was hidden for more than four centuries, sold at 2.3 million euros ($2.7 million) at an auction Sunday in Versailles.",
      "The painting was recently found in a private townhouse in Paris. It depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.",
      "It was part of a French collection and was initially thought to be from one of the many Rubens workshops that existed at the time. The artwork was rarely valued at more than 10,000 euros ($11,500).",
      "\u201cI immediately had a hunch about this painting, and I did everything I could to try to have it authenticated,\u201d auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd finally, we managed to have it authenticated by the Rubenianum, which is the Rubens committee in Antwerp.\u201d",
      "Nils B\u00fcttner, an expert known for his research on Rubens, explained before the auction that the master often painted crucifictions but rarely depicted \"the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross.\"",

      "The Osenat auction house said the painting\u2019s authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments, whose use is typical in Rubens\u2019 depictions of human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",

    "story": [
      "Tollywood, the Telugu-language film industry, is rapidly gaining global attention, challenging Bollywood's dominance",
      "HYDERABAD, India -- A fast-rising parallel film industry in India is competing with Bollywood's musicals and action-packed films and has taken the world by storm: It\u2019s called Tollywood.",
      "As Mumbai is to Hindi films \u2014 or Bollywood \u2014 the southern Indian city of Hyderabad is to movies made in Telugu, one of the country\u2019s most widely spoken languages. Tollywood films like \u201cRRR\u201d and \u201cBaahubali\u201d have achieved international acclaim at the box office and on the awards stage.",
      "The Telugu-language film industry, widely known as Tollywood, is one of India\u2019s many regional movie-producing centers. But it's drawn national and global audiences with its high-adrenaline action movies, mythic storylines and grand visual style. It has carved out its own identity separate from Hindi-language Bollywood by leaning toward star-driven spectacle and large-scale epics.",
      "Tollywood primarily operates out of Hyderabad, which is home to Ramoji Film City. The 1,666-acre (674-hectare) facility, recognized by Guinness World Records as the world\u2019s largest film studio complex, houses massive film studio complexes, dozens of production houses, warehouses, movie sets and post-production facilities. The industry churns out around 300 films every year \u2014 fewer than Bollywood but still enough to make it one of India\u2019s largest regional industries.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s growing exposure was in large part sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, as the rapid expansion of streaming services in India allowed regional films to find wider audiences. That expansion also coincided with Bollywood\u2019s struggle to lure audiences back to theaters amid repetitive storylines and rehashes of hits from other languages.",
      "What has also worked in favor of Tollywood is that it offers a rare balance of high-octane action films and nuanced movies charged with real human drama.",
      "\u201cTelugu people have a lot of interest in movies. The Telugu audience watch and accept all kind of movies. They are cinema lovers,\u201d says filmmaker T.V. Ravi Narayan, who is working on a biopic based on an 18th-century social activist. \u201cBecause they are cinema lovers, be it \u2018Baahubali,\u2019 \u2018Pushpa\u2019 or \u2018RRR,\u2019 be it big budget or small budget, be it realistic or biopics or fantasy movies, the audiences accept it.\u201d",
      "Tollywood is known for its high-energy storytelling, big action set pieces and grand spectacle that are heavy on visual effects. It often blends family drama, action and mythology into movies, increasingly marketed as \u201cpan-India\u201d releases and dubbed in multiple regional languages.",
      "The films, like other big Indian productions, have crowd-pleasing visuals and feature viral songs and dances central to the narrative and usually presented as grand performance set pieces.",
      "Many Tollywood films are also remade in Bollywood, which has become a proven formula to expand Telugu cinema across India. Dubbing \u2014 where actors record voice-overs in Hindi or a professional voice artist replaces the track \u2014 is also a standard and tested practice that has made Tollywood more accessible.",
      "The industry does also produce smaller, low-budget films that tend to focus on stories rooted in Telugu culture. Most of them are set in rural landscapes and explore themes such as social issues, regional cultures and class inequality. Some of those films are sent straight to streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where they enjoy a wide reach across India.",
      "Many Tollywood movie stars like Mahesh Babu, Allu Arjun, Prabhas, Ram Charan and N.T. Rama Rao Jr. command a near-godlike following, with devoted fan bases that cut across generations. Their movie releases are often tied to regional religious festivals and are preceded by carefully marketed music launch events and dance performances that are a spectacle in itself. Tens of thousands of fans attend such events, as they did recently with the first look of S.S. Rajamouli's \u201cVaranasi.\u201d",
      "The industry has also led to a massive fan club culture, predominantly centered around male film stars. Some fans are so invested in their favorite stars that they often organize charitable drives and blood donation camps in their names. It is not unusual for fans to perform acts of literal worship, washing male stars' cardboard cutouts or statues with milk \u2014 a ritual usually reserved for Hindu gods.",
      "In theaters across Hyderabad, viewers will commonly dance, whistle and throw confetti in the air during releases of films. Outside, billboards of major stars are a frequent sight in the city.",

    "story": [
      "An AI-generated country song, \u201cWalk My Walk,\u201d recently topped Billboard's country digital song sales chart",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When an AI-generated country song called \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d hit No. 1 on Billboard's country digital song sales chart this month, it was credited to a fictional artist named Breaking Rust \u2014 a white, digitally generated avatar that didn't exist two months ago.",
      "But the song's vocal phrasing, melodic shape and stylistic DNA came from someone who does exist: Grammy-nominated country artist Blanco Brown, a Black music artist who has worked with Britney Spears, Childish Gambino and Rihanna.",
      "And he had no idea.",
      "\u201cI didn't even know about the song until people hit me up about it,\u201d said Brown, whose 2019 country rap hit \u201cThe Git Up\u201d helped usher in a new, hybrid era of country crossover. He didn't learn about the chart-topping AI track until his phone was flooded with messages from friends.",
      "\u201cMy phone just kept blowing up,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody said: 'Man, somebody done typed your name in the AI and made a white version of you. They just used the Blanco, not the Brown.\u201d",
      "The moment is the latest example of how generative AI is upending the music industry, giving anyone the ability to instantly create seemingly new songs by typing prompts into a chat window, often using models trained on real artists' voices and styles without their knowledge.",
      "The credits for the grit-filled, chant-heavy track \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d list Aubierre Rivaldo Taylor as one of the song's creators, with streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify identifying him as both the songwriter and producer. In recent months, Taylor has also been credited on streaming platforms as the songwriter and producer behind Defbeatsai \u2014 one of several X-rated, AI-generated country artists that exploded across social media last year.",
      "The Defbeatsai ecosystem, however, connects back to another figure in Brown's past: Abraham Abushmais, a collaborator Brown once jokingly called \u201cAbe Einstein\u201d for his sharp studio instincts. Abushmais co-wrote a couple of songs on Brown's 2019 album \u201cHoneysuckle & Lightning Bugs\u201d and is listed as the developer of Echo, an obscure AI-powered music generator app promoted on one of Defbeats.ai's Instagram pages with a link encouraging users to \u201cmake your own hit country song.\u201d",
      "Brown said he wasn't notified about their involvement in the AI hit, and the collaborator he once mentored has since become unreachable.",
      "\u201cAbe\u2019s number changed,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe used to talk. I ain\u2019t heard from him in a year or two.\u201d",

      "The digital avatar fronting \u201cWalk My Walk,\" a white, AI-generated country singer built with a vocal approach modeled on Brown's sound, is where the moment shifted from eerie to uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a white AI man with a Black voice,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s singing like a Negro spiritual.\u201d",
      "For Brown, the shock quickly gave way to action. He went into the studio and recorded his cover of the song, which was released last week. He's also putting out a reworked derivative of the track on Monday with new lyrics and a new arrangement.",
      "Brown's management said his response to the song is a direct challenge to the legal, ethical and policy void surrounding AI-generated music. He wants to use his own lived experience to force the industry and lawmakers to confront who owns art and what happens when technology outpaces the rights of the human creators it imitates.",

      "For musicians and educators, the success of \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d made one thing clear: AI-generated music has leapt from internet experiment to commercial disruptor.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a very strange and unprecedented period of both creation and industry,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of the Ohio University Music Industry Summit. \u201cAI has essentially democratized the act of music creation itself.\u201d",

      "That democratization has come with no guardrails. Major record labels sued Suno and Udio \u2014 two most popular AI song generators \u2014 accusing them of training their models on copyrighted recordings without permission.",
      "\u201cThese companies trained their platforms on a volume of recorded music without permission,\u201d Antonuccio said. \u201cIt leaves creators in this strange purgatory where they're not getting compensated.\u201d",
      "Some labels have now shifted from lawsuits to negotiation. Universal Music Group recently settled a copyright infringement lawsuits with Udio and signed a new licensing agreement with the platform. Warner Music Group followed with its own deal on Tuesday, partnering with Suno in what the companies called a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d agreement to develop licensed AI music that both compensates and protects artists.",

      "For Brown, this situation is a legal and cultural issue.",
      "He spent years navigating country music as a Black artist who blends gospel, hip-hop, pop and twang. He's been nominated for a Grammy and embraced by the Recording Academy, but country radio hasn't given him consistent traction.",
      "Meanwhile, an AI song built on his vocal identity and paired with a white avatar went straight to No. 1, a dynamic he says reflects a familiar pattern in Nashville: innovation from Black artists being reattributed.",
      "\u201cHe created something with my tone and gave it a white face,\u201d Brown said. \u201c(Race) is an understatement in Nashville.\u201d",
      "Music educators say the issue goes beyond authorship. While AI tools can convincingly approximate sound, they aren\u2019t able to capture the source of it.",

He spoke shortly after appearing on on a Future of Music panel at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles last week. \u201cThey occupy fundamentally different spaces.\u201d",
      "Berg said AI tracks can sometimes be polished in an eerie manner, but the intangible elements of performance remain out of reach.",
      "\u201cThere's an energy between an artist and an audience that happens in real time that you can't see but you can feel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are so many light years away from that happening in an AI environment.\u201d",
      "Brown insists he's not anti-AI. He's not even angry with Abushmais. He's proud that his sound inspired someone, but he understands what the moment exposes.",
      "For him, the arrival of an AI artist built on his tone only underscored something he has learned repeatedly in Nashville: talent is one thing, but how the industry assigns value is often something else.",
      "\u201cI go through this every day with real people who steal and borrow from what I do,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo I don't care if it's a robot or a human. They're not giving me credit anyway.\u201d",
      "In a fast-changing landscape, Brown said artists will have one final advantage that machines can't mimic.",
      "\u201cReal artists are always going to prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cPurpose lives where greed can't.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Prize-winning military historian Rick Atkinson, a comic book fan growing up, hadn't imagined his own work being suitable for the illustrated format.",
      "Ten Speed Graphic announced Tuesday that a graphic edition of \u201cThe British Are Coming,\u201d the first volume of Atkinson's acclaimed Revolutionary War trilogy, will be out next June, shortly before the country's 250th anniversary.

And they had made him look like the paunchy, bald John Adams of the vice presidency. And they fixed it.\u201d",
      "Atkinson, a Pulitzer Prize winner for his World War II book \u201cAn Army at Dawn,\u201d has been working on his revolutionary trilogy for a decade and published the second volume, \u201cThe Fate of the Day,\u201d this spring. Widely regarded as among the best living military historians, he was a featured commentator in Ken Burns' \u201cThe American Revolution\u201d documentary and has made numerous joint appearances with the filmmaker.

Across 18 tracks, \u201cChristmas in the City\u201d celebrates the magic of cosmopolitan life around the holidays and showcases the group's vocal athletics. Hear them reimagine the songs you know and love as well as introduce a few originals. Start with \u201cSnowing in Paris,\u201d which features the R&B-pop star JoJo, and end with \u201cI\u2019ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm,\u201d a never-before-heard recording of the Frank Sinatra classic featuring Ol' Blue Eyes himself.",

Part of its charms, of course, must be credited to its whimsical score by jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi. To celebrate such a huge anniversary, Craft Recordings is reissuing its soundtrack \u2014 as good a reason as any to revisit these beloved songs.",
      "Just ahead of her Christmas tour, the country icon LeAnn Rimes released \u201cGreatest Hits Christmas.\u201d It's exactly what it sounds like: a mesh of classics and some of her best-known songs from her past holiday albums.

      "The committee makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee's recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. He also named Kulldorff as chairman.",
      "Under Kulldorff's leadership, the group made several decisions that angered major medical groups.",
      "At a June meeting, the panel recommended that a preservative called thimerosal be removed from doses of flu vaccine even though some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm.",
      "In September, the group recommended new restrictions on a combination shot that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. The panel also took the unprecedented step of not recommending COVID-19 vaccinations \u2014 not even for high-risk populations like seniors \u2014 instead making it a matter of personal choice.",
      "Several doctors\u2019 groups said the changes were not based on good evidence, and advised doctors and patients to follow guidance that was previously in place.",
      "Kulldorff's departure leaves the vaccine committee with 11 members.",
      "It will now be led by Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional hearing at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines.",
      "Kulldorff is a Swedish-born biostatistician who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "During his time as ACIP chair, the committee abandoned its traditional \"evidence-to-recommendation\" framework, which involved many months of analysis and discussion before proposals came before the full committee for a vote.",

      "In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles while injecting drugs. But the virus can also be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections that can lead to a lifetime of health issues.",
      "A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).",

      "The holiday season is a popular time for volunteering, but experts say giving back is beneficial year-round",
      "WASHINGTON -- The holiday season is a time for giving thanks, giving gifts \u2014 and for many, a time for giving back.",
      "Food banks, services that deliver meals to seniors and other U.S. charities typically see a surge in volunteering between Thanksgiving and the end of the year. But there are good reasons to volunteer at any time of the year.",
      "Alfred Del Grosso volunteers weekly to work the lunch shift at Shepherd\u2019s Table, a food bank in Silver Spring, Maryland. \u201cI feel more connected to the broader community,\u201d he said.",
      "Most Thursdays, the retired chemist from Kensington, Maryland, also lends an unpaid hand to help clear fallen trees and brush from local trails with the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. \"It\u2019s mostly volunteers who help maintain the trails,\" he said.",
      "Researchers who study human evolution and social psychology say that giving back is deeply rooted in human nature. Volunteers say they feel closer ties to the communities they serve.",
      "\u201cWhen we feel grateful for all we have, that motivates us to do good things for other people who have helped us, and also to do good things for new people,\" said Sarah Schnitker, a psychologist at Baylor University.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a nice upwards reciprocal spiral between gratitude and generosity,\u201d often enhanced at holiday times, she said.",
      "For many in the U.S., the season most associated with giving, receiving and volunteering runs from Thanksgiving through Hanukkah and Christmas to New Year\u2019s.",
      "But around the world, a giving season or festival is present in many cultures, said Amrisha Vaish, a developmental psychologist at the University of Virginia.",
      "\u201cNearly all cultures have events or public festivals that allow people to express gratitude,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Hinduism, Divali is a time of lights and festiveness and good eating, but also a time in which people give gifts to really express what people have meant to them.\u201d",
      "For Muslims, Ramadan, which ends with the festival of Eid al-Fitr, is a time for reflection, gratitude and acts of charity. Many Buddhist traditions also emphasize gratitude.",
      "The common purpose of such seasons, which also include non-religious acts of service, is to reinforce our natural cooperative tendencies, Vaish said.",
      "\u201cIn human evolutionary history over hundreds of thousands of years, we\u2019ve had to become cooperative in order to work together and survive as a species,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have sharp claws, high speed, many other natural abilities. But what we do have is that we\u2019re super cooperators; we can do more in groups than alone.\u201d",

      "A new type of lens approved by the FDA promises to slow nearsightedness in children",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many children, the experience of getting their first pair of glasses is an inevitable milestone, the first in a lifetime of visits to the eye doctor.",
      "But what if those lenses could actually help preserve the child\u2019s vision and reduce the chances for more serious eye problems in adulthood?",
      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",
      "Studies conducted around the world have shown rising rates of myopia, which researchers have associated with increased time indoors looking at screens, books and other objects held close to the eyes.",
      "In the U.S., 30% to 40% of children will have myopia by the time they finish high school, according to Dr. Michael Repka, a professor and pediatric ophthalmologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",
      "Until now, doctors had few options for treating the condition.",
      "\u201cIt was typically and simply: \u2018Your child needs to wear glasses and they\u2019ll live with it,\u2019\u201d Repka said. \u201c'It will be lifelong and it will likely get worse over the next few years.\u2019\u201d",
      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",
      "Ophthalmologists say the potential benefits go beyond preserving vision to heading off some long-term consequences of severe myopia, which can include cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachment that can lead to blindness.",

      "Major U.S. vision insurance providers are expected to cover the lenses for children who meet the prescribing criteria.",
      "The only other FDA-approved product to slow myopia are contact lenses made by a company called MiSight. The daily disposable lenses, approved in 2019, use a similar approach intended to slow the progression of nearsightedness in children ages 8 to 12.",
      "But Gupta says many parents and physicians are likely to prefer the glasses.",
      "\u201cA lot of people might be hesitant to put a child as young as 8 in contact lenses, so the glasses offer a really nice alternative,\u201d she said.",
      "Some doctors prescribe medicated eye drops intended to slow myopia, but those are not approved by the FDA.",
      "Under the FDA\u2019s approval decision, the lenses can be prescribed to any child with myopia who\u2019s within the recommended age range. There were no serious side effects, according to FDA, although some children reported visual disturbances, such as halos around objects while wearing the lenses.",
      "The studies that the FDA reviewed for approval were conducted in Asia. Repka said U.S. ophthalmologists and optometrists may want to see some additional research.",

    "summary": "The White House is circulating a proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for two more years",
    "story": [
      "The White House is circulating a proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for two more years",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House is circulating a proposal that would extend subsidies to help consumers pay for coverage under the Affordable Care Act for two more years, as millions of Americans face spiking health care costs when the current tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "The draft plan suggests that President Donald Trump is open to extending a provision of Obamacare as his administration and congressional Republicans search for a broader policy solution to a fight that has long flummoxed the party. The White House stresses that no plan is final until Trump announces it.",
      "The subsidies were at the heart of the Democrats\u2019 demands in the government shutdown fight that ended earlier this month. Most Democratic lawmakers had insisted on a straight extension of the tax credits, which expire at the end of the year as a condition of keeping the government open.",
      "Eligibility for the Obamacare subsidies, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people afford health care coverage, would be capped at 700% of the federal poverty level, according to two people with knowledge of the proposal. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a White House proposal that is in draft form.",
      "The baseline tax credits that were originally part of the Affordable Care Act were capped at 400% of the federal poverty level, but that cut-off was suspended because of the temporary COVID-era credits that allowed middle- and higher-income people to benefit from subsidies too.",
      "The White House would also require those on Obamacare, regardless of the type of coverage, to pay some sort of premium for their Obamacare plans. That would effectively end zero-premium plans for those with lower incomes, addressing a concern from Republicans that the program has enabled fraud.

      "Lebanese citizens were enraged by the blast, which appeared to be the result of government negligence, coming on top of the economic crisis. But an investigation has repeatedly stalled, and five years on, no official has been convicted.",

      "BEIRUT -- Over the past few decades, hundreds of thousands of Christians have left parts of the Middle East for good, driven by wars and the rise of Muslim extremists.",
      "In Lebanon, it has been different. Despite the many crises that have battered the small nation, Christians continue to enjoy religious freedom and significant political influence.",
      "Pope Leo XIV's visit to Lebanon over the weekend is a recognition of the importance of Lebanon\u2019s religious pluralism and a message to Christians not to abandon the region.",
      "In Iraq, large numbers of Christians fled after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and the rise of the Islamic State group that followed. A decade later, in 2014, IS declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria leading to an exodus by Christians as well as followers of other religions.",
      "IS blew up churches in areas they once controlled in Syria and Iraq and confiscated many Christians' property.",
      "A recent church bombing in Damascus this year made some Christians who stayed in Syria consider leaving.

      "Synthia Khoury, 25, a business graduate from Syria who joined a delegation heading to Lebanon to see the Pope, said that after the takeover of power in her country by an Islamist-led government last year, Christians in the war-torn country were worried that they would not be able to practice their religious freely, although so far this has not turned out to be the case.",
      "\u201cWe know that the conditions of Christians in Lebanon are somewhat better than ours, but we also know that they passed through many wars,\u201d Khoury said adding that despite the hardships Lebanese Christians had faced, \u201cthey did not leave and stayed in their country and preserved their customs and traditions, and this is beautiful.\u201d",
      "Deeply rooted since the early days of the faith, Christians in present-day Lebanon have survived wars and genocide over the past two millennia. For many years, Christian monastic communities lived in caves in the rugged mountains to protect their faith and avoid persecution. Since the establishment of the State of Greater Lebanon in 1920 following World War I, Christians have played an instrumental role in shaping the country\u2019s politics and economy.",

      "His visit comes as Turkey and Armenia appear to be moving closer toward a normalization of their ties and the pontiff's visit is likely to lend support to those efforts, said Richard Giragosian, the founding director of the Regional Studies Center based in Yerevan, Armenia.",
      "\u201cMore than just the symbolic importance of bringing the Vatican closer to the Armenian Church in terms of the eastern religion outreach, (the visit) is also, in some ways, promoting Armenia-Turkish normalization,\u201d Giragosian said.",
      "Leo arrived in Turkey on Thursday on his first foreign visit to mark the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, now the town of Iznik, where the united Christian Church agreed on a shared creed of faith. He was then scheduled to continue to Lebanon.",
      "Turkey and Armenia have no formal diplomatic ties and their border has remained closed since the 1990s. In 2021, the countries agreed to work toward normalization, appointing special envoys to explore steps toward reconciliation and reopening the frontier.",
      "Those talks have progressed in parallel with efforts to ease tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, a close Turkish ally. Turkey supported Azerbaijan during its 2020 conflict with Armenia for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, a conflict that had lasted nearly four decades.",
      "Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan visited Turkey in June for talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He later told a group of Turkish journalists in Yerevan that pursuing international recognition of the genocide is not among his government\u2019s priorities, while emphasizing the genocide is an \u201cindisputable fact\u201d for Armenians.",
      "Leo is not expected to press for the formal recognition of genocide.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not part of the normalization engagement. So it\u2019s pretty clear that he will avoid either the word or the reference,\u201d Giragosian said.",
      "On Sunday, Leo will arrive at the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral for a service steeped in the church\u2019s traditions, with some 500 Armenian worshipers in attendance, said Garo Vram Babayan, spokesman for the Armenian patriarchate in Istanbul.",
      "The visit will begin with prayers, followed by speeches from the pope and Istanbul-based Patriarch Sahak II. The two will exchange gifts before stepping outside for a brief dedication ceremony, where Leo will unveil a marble stone in his honor.",

      "Leo spent his formative years in Chicago, where he would have interacted with immigrant communities including Armenian Americans, Giragosian said.",
      "Vercihan Ziflioglu, an Istanbul-based journalist and author of Armenian descent, also said the pope's visit to Turkey was important in terms of highlighting the country's Christian past. Despite Francis' recognition of the genocide, Leo was not expected to repeat the term, she said.",
      "\u201cDuring this trip, especially at such a stage \u2014 when there are developments aimed at \u2018normalization\u2019 between Turkey and Armenia \u2014 I absolutely do not think he will emphasize such a sensitive issue,\u201d Ziflioglu said.",
      "In Armenia, Armen Arshakyan, 65, said he didn't believe the pope\u2019s visit would alter Turkey\u2019s policies, but was nevertheless a positive step that honors Armenians.",

      "Another Yerevan resident, 31-year-old Maria Petrosyan, said Leo\u2019s visit to the Armenian church \u201ccannot be of great global importance\u201d but stated she values the pontiff maintaining dialogue with different churches.",
      "Archimandrite Barouyr Shernezian, the dean of the Armenian Theological Seminary of the Catholicosate in Lebanon, also welcomed Leo\u2019s visit, saying it would show Turkey is part of the heritage of many ancient Christian denominations, including the Armenian Church.",
      "The visit to the Armenian Cathedral in Istanbul comes during ongoing strain in the Caucasus, including between Pashinyan and the Armenian Apostolic Church. The tensions have simmered since April 2024, when thousands of protesters led by prominent clerics demanded Pashinyan\u2019s ouster for his efforts to normalize ties with Azerbaijan.",
      "In response, Armenian authorities arrested a number of clerics, accusing them of calling for an overthrow of the government and coercing people into taking part in rallies.

      "Her support for the National Party\u2019s Asfura \u2014 who as mayor paved roads and improved the capital's infrastructure \u2014 was motivated in part by a burning desire to kick out the governing democratic socialist LIBRE or Liberty and Re-foundation party.",

      "Trump\u2019s effect and his motivation have been hotly debated in Honduras. Some say that Rixi Moncada, LIBRE\u2019s candidate, would have suffered even without Trump\u2019s attacks and warning that she would take Honduras down the same path as Venezuela. After all, Trump said the same about Nasralla, and he was only about 700 votes behind Asfura with ballots from about 56% of polling places counted Monday.",

      "His comments \u201cplayed a transcendental role and made a drastic change between Salvador (Nasralla) and (Nasry) Asfura,\u201d he said.",
      "He saw the impact as being on undecided voters and those who had been thinking about \u201cloaning\u201d their votes to Nasralla, but ultimately went for Asfura instead.",
      "However, it remained unclear if Asfura\u2019s early edge in the preliminary results would hold. He predictably enjoyed heavy support in the capital, whose tallies were among the first to arrive. But as the count inched along, Nasralla pulled even Monday with about 39% of the vote. A candidate only needs to secure the most votes to win the presidency, even if that is less than 50%.",
      "Nasralla expressed confidence that the outstanding votes in the north where his party is stronger would eventually overtake Asfura.",

      "So far the team has examined four of the seven blocks, Cheng said.",

      "In early November, Kashish Ali posted those words to her Instagram story as part of a yearslong practice she's had to fundraise for food and drop it off at community fridges in Atlanta, where she's from, and now in New York, where she lives. Ali, who is 32 and a first generation Pakistani immigrant, estimated that her friends and family have trusted her with thousands of dollars over the past couple of years.",
      "For her, it's a practice of giving back and creating connection. It's also part of a growing interest in grassroots efforts to meet community needs that many call \u201c mutual aid.\u201d Often, mutual aid just comes down to neighbors helping neighbors, and as many face high prices, cuts to government programs and political uncertainty, organizers say interest has swelled. Donating effort or time to mutual aid organizing is also another way to mark GivingTuesday, which falls on Dec. 2 this year, and has become a major day to support nonprofits.",
      "Ali first noticed a fridge on the street outside of a brewery in Atlanta in 2021 and got in touch with the organizers via social media. She completed a brief volunteer orientation, joined a group text chat and then posted on her Instagram that she would buy and drop off groceries.",
      "\u201cI ended up raising $700 in like three to four hours, which was insane,\u201d she said.",
      "Now, Ali doesn't think of her grocery runs as volunteering but rather as a habit engrained in her life that directly connects to those around her. She said when she starts putting granola bars, fruit or yogurt into a fridge, people immediately come around to look, chat and grab something to eat.",
      "Afterwards, Ali posts her grocery receipts and photos of the filled fridge to her Instagram account.",
      "\u201cWhat I noticed was a lot of my friends and family and coworkers and colleagues, they all want to get involved. They want to give back,\" she said. \"But sometimes donating your cash or money to whatever organization, you don\u2019t really see what happens with it per se, especially not immediately. So this was a way to get almost instant gratification.\"",
      "One of the principles of mutual aid is that it welcomes everyone. There's no need to show an ID or prove income or residency, and most often, the organizers of these types of very local projects are all volunteers. Organizers are also often recipients, with many groups seeking to remove the distinction entirely between those who give help and those who need it.",
      "The low barriers to entry and lack of hierarchy are also part of what distinguishes this approach from the work of nonprofits, organizers said. A mantra of mutual aid is, \u201csolidarity not charity.\u201d",
      "Interest in mutual aid organizing often spikes in response to crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic and now, economic and political uncertainty under the second Trump administration.",
      "Aaron Fernando, who works as an organizer for Shareable, which publishes resources about mutual aid and cooperatives, said they saw huge interest in the Mutual Aid 101 webinars they launched earlier this year. Some 1,100 people attended the first one, up from around 70 attendees at a typical webinar.",
      "\u201cIt just is and continues to be a disempowering and scary time for a lot of populations,\u201d said Fernando, which he said encourages people to seek new options to find resources and keep their communities safe.",

Formerly a merchandiser in fashion, Nu\u00f1ez and her fellow organizers specialize at finding free stuff.",

Now, they have arrangements with Trader Joe\u2019s and Wegmans to pick up food that would otherwise go to waste. They put produce and prepared foods in community fridges outside their Brooklyn storefront and it\u2019s taken almost immediately.",

      "\u201cUsually, we want people to branch off and make their own groups because if we all have groups, it just makes us stronger,\u201d she said.",
      "Collective Focus decided to incorporate as a tax-exempt nonprofit in part to afford to rent their space. But they make decisions collectively and rely extensively on volunteers, though they do pay some staff members, including Georgina Edmonds, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years.",
      "At a recent food distribution where they were handing out lentils, tofu, carrots, potatoes, onions, cabbage and apples, Edmonds said the group empowers its member to make decisions and shape the direction of their work.

      "The restriction on \" proposition bets,\" though less sweeping than in some states, highlights an area of rising concern as legal sports betting spreads to its 39th state in a steady expansion since the Supreme Court cleared the way for it in 2018.",
      "In the weeks leading up to Missouri's betting debut, one scandal after another has rocked the sports world. Two Cleveland Guardians pitchers were charged with taking bribes to throw certain pitches. An NBA player was arrested over an alleged scheme to provide inside information to gamblers. And the NCAA revoked the eligibility of six men\u2019s college basketball players accused of manipulating their performance in games.",
      "All centered around the outcome of prop bets, a popular type of wager often focused on what individual players will do in a game \u2014 like achieving a certain number of strikeouts in baseball, racking up a certain amount of points and rebounds in basketball, or surpassing a particular passing yardage in football.",
      "For bettors, a lot can ride on one player, putting those athletes at risk of threats or enticements to rig their performance.",
      "Sports betting operators took in over $11 billion through the first three-quarters of this year, up more than 13% from the same span last year, according to the American Gaming Association, which represents the industry.",
      "Though national data is lacking about the prevalence of prop bets, they are \u201can increasingly popular way in which to provide for engagement for any type of fan,\u201d said Joe Maloney, the association's senior vice president of strategic communications.",
      "West Virginia, which was among the first to allow sports betting after the court ruling, now is collecting a trove of data from the industry. During a roughly one-month period this summer, prop bets comprised more than half of all wagers made through one of the largest sports betting platforms, said Brad Humphreys, an economics professor and director of the Center for Gaming Research and Development at West Virginia University.",
      "Additionally, he said, almost all bets involved parlays, where two or more wagers are grouped together under the umbrella of a larger bet. To win, a person must be right on each prong in the bet, making the odds of success longer and the potential payout larger.",
      "Because prop bets \u201cspeed up the ability to make multiple bets,\u201d they carry a higher risk of developing addictive behavior for some bettors, said Rachel Volberg, a research professor of epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has spent decades studying gambling.",
      "Most states provide some money for problem gambling services. Missouri's new sports betting program allots at least $5 million annually for that purpose.",
      "Prop bets on professional athletes are currently allowed in every state that has legalized sports betting, though legislation proposed in New Jersey would ban them. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has urged state regulators to end player-specific micro betting and told The Associated Press recently he regrets signing the law that legalized sports gambling in his state.",
      "States have widely differing rules for bets on college athletes. More than a dozen states place no limits on collegiate prop bets while an equal number prohibit all such bets. Other states fall somewhere in between. Missouri is one of over a half-dozen states with a prop bet prohibition pertaining only to games involving college teams from their states.",

      "WASHINGTON -- For many children, the experience of getting their first pair of glasses is an inevitable milestone, the first in a lifetime of visits to the eye doctor.",
      "But what if those lenses could actually help preserve the child\u2019s vision and reduce the chances for more serious eye problems in adulthood?",
      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",
      "Studies conducted around the world have shown rising rates of myopia, which researchers have associated with increased time indoors looking at screens, books and other objects held close to the eyes.",
      "In the U.S., 30% to 40% of children will have myopia by the time they finish high school, according to Dr. Michael Repka, a professor and pediatric ophthalmologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",

      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",

      "Since it started as a hashtag in 2012, GivingTuesday, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, has become one of the biggest fundraising days of the year for nonprofits in the U.S. This year, it falls on Dec. 2",
      "Since it started as a hashtag in 2012, GivingTuesday, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, has become one of the biggest fundraising days of the year for nonprofits in the U.S. This year, nonprofits face uncertainty about how donors may respond to a range of changing factors.",
      "High prices may affect how much small dollar donors give this year or how many charities they will support. But President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending legislation, which passed in July, also included a new charitable deduction of up to $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for married couples for the majority of tax filers. That could incentivize more households to give.",
      "For larger donors, a strong stock market usually indicates they will give generously. These major donors also make up an increasingly important share of overall charitable donations and are more likely to give than less economically well off households, according to a study from the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy in partnership with Bank of America.",
      "Nonprofits are also letting potential supporters know about a range of new challenges this year, with many human service organizations seeing higher demand while facing cuts to government grants, especially last month's freeze of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. And many charities are highlighting programs that will match or multiply donations \u2014 even up to a factor of five at some nonprofits \u2014 to showcase increased impact.",
      "Altogether, that sets up GivingTuesday, which falls on Dec. 2 to be a high stakes fundraising day for U.S. nonprofits.",
      "The #GivingTuesday hashtag started as a project of the 92nd Street Y in New York in 2012 and became an independent organization in 2020. It\u2019s grown into a worldwide network of local organizations that promote giving in their communities, often on different dates that have local relevance, like holidays.",
      "Now, GivingTuesday, the nonprofit, also convenes researchers working on topics about everyday giving. It also collects data from a wide range of sources like payment processors, crowdfunding sites, employee giving software and institutions that offer donor-advised funds, a kind of charitable giving account.",
      "The hashtag was started to promote generosity and the nonprofit continues to promote giving in the broadest sense.",
      "For nonprofits, the point of GivingTuesday is to raise money and engage their supporters. Many will be familiar with the barrage of email and mail appeals that coincide on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. Essentially all major American nonprofits will organize fundraising campaigns and many smaller, local groups also participate.",
      "Nonprofits don\u2019t have to be affiliated in any way with GivingTuesday, the organization, to run a fundraising campaign. They can just do it, though GivingTuesday does provide graphics and advice. In that way, it remains a grassroots effort with groups and donors participating however they like.",
      "There is essentially no wrong way to choose what nonprofit or cause to give to, volunteer with or champion.",

      "You could consider giving to organizations based in your community, whose impact will be felt locally. You could also choose to support a nonprofit that works on a cause you have a personal connection to. There are also many organizations that rate nonprofits or offer analysis about which organizations are most effective, though you will see a range of opinions on what it means to be effective.",
      "Many nonprofits appreciate donors committing to give smaller gifts each month rather than one lump sum at the end of the year. These regular donations help them plan ahead.",
      "You can also consider giving directly to people on crowdfunding sites or through mutual aid networks, which are often small, informal groups that organize to meet local needs.",
      "That depends on how success is measured, but it certainly has grown far beyond the initial effort to promote giving on social media. The day has become an enduring and well-known event that seeks to center charitable giving, volunteering and civic participation in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "For years, GivingTuesday has been a major focus of fundraising for nonprofits, with many seeking to organize matching donations from major donors and to leverage their networks of supporters to contribute. It is the beginning of the end-of-year fundraising rush, as nonprofits seek to reach their budget targets for the following year.",
      "Donations on GivingTuesday in 2024 reached $3.6 billion, an increase from the previous two years.",

The vote came just days after U.S. President Donald Trump intervened in a close race by endorsing a candidate and announcing that he would pardon a former president.",
      "The National Electoral Council said that Nasry \u201cTito\u201d Asfura of the National Party had 40.54% of votes in early counting, while Salvador Nasralla, of the conservative Liberal Party, had about 38.99%. Rixi Moncada of the democratic socialist LIBRE or Liberty and Re-foundation party trailed with 19.49%.",
      "Both Asfura and Nasralla said it was still early in the count and resisted declaring victory. After initial excitement at both parties' campaign headquarters, the streets of the capital were generally quiet Sunday night as the count slowly advanced.",

      "As the preliminary results came in late Sunday, Nasralla said the the race was still too close to call. \u201cWe are really going to know the result tomorrow in the course of the day,\u201d he said. He expressed confidence that the remaining vote tallies would favor him.",

      "Organizers say that in response to government funding cuts, high prices and political uncertainty, interest in mutual aid efforts has picked up",
      "When major disruptions happen in communities, often the first people to respond are the residents themselves and their neighbors. When the pandemic shut down daily life or after a disaster like a hurricane or wildfire, people get together to take care of each other.",
      "Even outside of a crisis, some who struggle to meet their needs may turn to mutual aid, the practice of finding resources from within a community and exchanging them for free.",
      "Now, in response to government funding cuts, high prices and political uncertainty, especially targeting immigrants, interest in mutual aid projects has picked up, organizers and participants say.",
      "\u201cThe exciting part about mutual aid is that you can really get together and help people in a really meaningful way just by pooling resources and being willing to reach out,\u201d said Mary Zerkel, who lives in the Rogers Park neighborhood in Chicago.",
      "Mutual aid practices have a long history, especially among immigrant and Black communities in the U.S., like the Black Panther\u2019s Survival Programs or informal pooled savings circles.",
      "Examples include sharing food, exchanging household goods and clothes or organizing shared items like tools. In recent years, groups have helped people access reproductive healthcare, including abortions, and coordinated collective responses to immigration arrests under the umbrella of providing mutual aid.",
      "In 2019, Zerkel helped start a shared artist and community space in her neighborhood along with a local chapter of Food Not Bombs, a longstanding mutual aid group that distributes food. When the pandemic hit, they cleared out the art supplies.",
      "\"All of a sudden, we had six fridges in there and we were feeding and delivering meals to 400 families,\u201d Zerkel said.",
      "Over time, the organizers adapted to changing needs. When they realized people needed items beyond food, they started a \"free store,\" where people can donate things they don't need. They trained volunteers in de-escalation techniques to diminish the possibility of ever calling the police. Later, they sourced naloxone, which reverses opioid overdoses, and held trainings on how to use it.",
      "\u201cThe main thing is that you\u2019re not trying to be an institution,\" Zerkel said. \"You\u2019re trying to be a neighbor helping a neighbor, so you can do the best that you can and try to be responsible and loving to your neighbors and build something slowly.\u201d",
      "Many mutual aid networks are not incorporated as formal organizations or nonprofits. Giving to them won't offer a tax deduction, but organizers say that because they are all volunteers, any donations they receive go directly to meeting real community needs.",
      "\u201cPeople are less suspicious of our intention. We are getting food and giving it out. We don\u2019t have any salaried employees,\u201d said Nicholas Grosso, who has organized with Sunnyside and Woodside Mutual Aid in Queens, New York.",

      "Mutual aid projects often specifically try to avoid hierarchies and make decisions collectively. Taylor Dudley, director of coalition building at the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of community accountability to mutual aid. Often times in nonprofits, rather than having the community accountability at the center, there\u2019s accountability to donors,\u201d or to administrative or legal considerations.",
      "Mutual aid efforts are built on trust and the relationships between organizers and their communities.",
      "Aaron Fernando, who works for Shareable, which publishes resources about mutual aid and cooperatives, said the small scale of many groups helps to hold people accountable. Over time, organizers know who is reliable and who has integrity. But there is a risk that opportunists take advantage of what is being offered.",
      "Often, mutual aid groups collect money and distribute it to people who need it or use it to buy things. Groups should consider how to handle those funds as sometimes they can be flagged as income by a payment processor. The Sustainable Economies Law Center has a guide that lays out multiple scenarios that mutual aid groups might encounter. Mohini Mookim, an attorney with the center, said rules around giving money with no strings attached are generally promising for mutual aid groups.",
      "\u201cWhen people are acting motivated by love, the tax code calls it generosity or feelings of generosity, then oftentimes, there are less legal, especially tax law, implications of what you\u2019re doing,\u201d they said.",
      "Another potential risk has to do with privacy or surveillance. For example, if a group is dropping food of at someone's home, they should think carefully about who has access to those addresses.",
      "There are also examples of mutual aid groups facing charges or being asked to stop handing out food by police. Fernando, of Shareable, said that often has less to do with concerns about people getting sick from the food and more about businesses or residents nearby not wanting the food distribution to happen there.",

      "Italian cultural officials are offering digital copies of Italian masterpieces as part of a new project to help museums raise money",
      "MILAN -- The last person to get their hands on a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci shelled out more than $450 million at auction. Now, Italian cultural officials are making it possible to purchase a limited edition, certified digital copy of the Renaissance genius\u2019 \u201cLady with Disheveled Hair\u2019\u2019 for roughly the price of a Lamborghini.",
      "The Italian nonprofit Save the Artistic Heritage with its technical partner Cinello are providing well-heeled collectors the possibility of owning a literal projection of original Italian masterpieces, sized and framed to match the museum experience.",
      "Participating museums sign a certificate of authenticity, and in return receive 50% of the profits.",
      "\u201cWe don't want to sell a piece of technology. We want to sell a piece of artwork,'' said John Blem, the Italian-born Danish entrepreneur who founded the initiative and who serves as chairman of Cinello and vice president of the nonprofit.",
      "The revenue sharing is integral to the project, which aims to help cash-strapped museums access new income streams, and a key part of the sales pitch, Blem said. Over the last two years, Save the Artistic Heritage has contributed 300,000 euros ($347,000) to its Italian museum partners, with prices of the digital masterpieces ranging from 30,000 euros to 300,000 euros.",
      "Contributing to the value, each is sold in a limited series of nine, representing the conventional number of statues that can be cast from a single mold and still be considered original.",
      "The catalog of some 250 Italian artworks comes from about 10 Italian museums and foundations, including the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan, the Capodimonte in Naples and the Pilotta in Parma, which owns Leonardo's unfinished painting on wood of a woman with windblown hair, which sold for 250,000 euros (nearly $290,000).",
      "Blem and a partner are in the process of setting up a similar nonprofit in the United States that is expected to launch next year.",
      "The digital artworks appear backlit on screens sized to match their originals, the luminescent effect bordering on Technicolor for such brightly colored masterpieces as Raffaelo's \u201cThe Marriage of the Virgin,'' which hangs in Milan's Brera Art Gallery.",
      "Others on display in the non-profit's Milan offices, like Leonardo's wind-swept portrait and Andrea Mantegna's \u201cLamentation over a Dead Christ,\u201d are more subdued. On close inspection, details are visible down to the brush stroke, but without any texture that may belong to the original.",
      "\u201cI must say that the digital copy of \u2018The Marriage of the Virgin' has aroused in me and all those who have seen it a great deal of interest,'' said Angelo Crespi, the Brera Art Gallery's director. \u201cThe perfection, the luminosity, the visibility of the painting is amazing. But at the same time it doesn't deceive. \u2026 When they get close, people can see that it's a digital copy on a screen.\u201d",

      "\u201cItalian museums, bodies, have been at the forefront of these technologies,'' he said, citing the Alinari Archive in Florence, a collection of over 5 million photographic materials dating from the mid-1800s, and the Vatican Museums, which collaborated on ultra-high-resolution digital photography to create a detailed record of the Sistine Chapel.",

      "The Brera gets 30% of its roughly 14 million euro budget from donations, sponsors and other projects, and just 10% from the state. The rest comes from tickets. Any new revenue source is precious.",
      "\u201cSave the Heritage is not just making a sale,'' Brera director Crespi said. \u201cThey are creating a system that allows anyone who buys an artwork to contribute to the museum.''",
      "The digital copies are projected onto screens sized to scale with original artworks in replica frames. The patented technology comprises a box that contains the digital copy that unlocks when in communication with Cinello\u2019s mainframe. Computer code makes each digital copy unique.",

      "There were notably big gains for the Czech Republic's Czechoslovak Group, whose revenue soared by 193% thanks in part to a government-led project to source artillery shells for Ukraine; and for Ukraine's JSC Ukrainian Defense Industry, which had a 41% gain.",

Brawls in store aisles over toys and TVs with limited-time discounts are spectacles of holidays past. Online shopping and retailers launching discounts weeks before the turkey feast subdued that kind of fervor.",

    "story": [
      "THC-infused drinks and snacks have soared in popularity as alcohol sales have declined in recent years",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The production lines at Indeed Brewing moved quickly, the cans filling not with beer, but with THC-infused seltzer. The product, which features the compound that gets cannabis users high, has been a lifeline at Indeed and other craft breweries as alcohol sales have fallen in recent years.",
      "But that boom looks set to come to a crashing halt. Buried in the bill that ended the federal government shutdown this month was a provision to ban those drinks, along with other impairing beverages and snacks made from hemp, which have proliferated across the country in recent years. Now the $24 billion hemp industry is scrambling to save itself before the provision takes effect in November 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\" said Ryan Bandy, Indeed's chief business officer. \"It would be a mess for our breweries, for our industry, and obviously for a lot of people who like these things.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know about the looming ban on impairing products derived from hemp.",
      "Marijuana and hemp are the same species. Marijuana is cultivated for high levels of THC in its flowers. Low-THC hemp is grown for its sturdy fibers, food or wellness products. \u201cRope, not dope\u201d was long the motto of farmers who supported legalizing hemp.",
      "After states began legalizing marijuana for adult use over a decade ago, hemp advocates saw an opening at the federal level. As part of the 2018 farm bill, Congress legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp to give farmers, including in Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's home state of Kentucky, a new cash crop.",
      "But the way that law defined hemp \u2014 as having less than 0.3% of a specific type of THC, called delta-9 \u2014 opened a huge loophole. Beverages or bags of snacks could meet that threshold and still contain more than enough THC to get people high. Businesses could further exploit the law by extracting a non-impairing compound, called CBD, and chemically changing it into other types of impairing THC, such as delta-8 or delta-10.",
      "The result? Vape oil, gummy candies, chips, cookies, sodas and other unregulated, untested products laden with hemp-derived THC spread around the country. In many places, they have been available at gas stations or convenience stores, even to teens. In legal marijuana states, they undercut heavily taxed and regulated products. In others, they evaded the prohibition on recreational use of weed.",
      "Some states, including Indiana, have reported spikes in calls to poison-control centers for pediatric exposure to THC.",
      "Dozens of states have since taken steps to regulate or ban impairing hemp products. In October, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning the sale of intoxicating hemp products outside the state's legal marijuana system.",
      "Texas, which has a massive hemp market, is moving to regulate sales of impairing hemp, such as by restricting them to those over 21. In Nebraska, lawmakers have instead considered a bill to criminalize the sale and possession of products containing hemp-based THC.",
      "Washington state adopted a program to regulate hemp growing. But the number of licensed growers has cratered since the state banned intoxicating hemp products outside of the regulated cannabis market in 2023. Five years ago, there were 220, said Trecia Ehrlich, cannabis program manager with the state agriculture department. This year, there were 42, and with a federal ban looming, she expects that number to drop by about half next year.",
      "Minnesota made infused beverages and foods legal in 2022 for people 21 and older. The products, which must be derived from legally certified hemp, have become so popular that Target is now offering THC drinks at some of its stores in the state.",
      "They've also been a boon to liquor stores and to small Minneapolis brewers like Indeed, where THC drinks make up close to one-quarter of the business, Bandy said. At Bauhaus Brew Labs, a few blocks away, THC drinks account for 26% of their revenues from distributed products and 11% of revenues at the brewery\u2019s taproom.",
      "None of that was what McConnell intended when he helped craft the 2018 farm bill. He finally closed the loophole by inserting a federal hemp THC ban in the measure to end the 43-day federal government shutdown, approved by the Senate on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cIt will keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children, while preserving the hemp industry for farmers,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIndustrial hemp and CBD will remain legal for industrial applications.\u201d",

      "But the ban doesn't take effect for a year. That has given the industry hope that there is still time to pass regulations that will improve the hemp THC industry \u2014 such as by banning synthetically derived THC, requiring age restrictions on sales, and prohibiting marketing to children \u2014 rather than eradicate it.",
      "\"We are very hopeful that cooler heads will prevail,\" said Jonathan Miller, general counsel of the industry group U.S. Hemp Roundtable. \u201cIf they really thought there was a health emergency, there would be no year-long period.\u201d",
      "The federal ban would jeopardize more than 300,000 jobs while costing states $1.5 billion in lost tax money, the group says.",

      "\u201cIf this goes through as written currently, I don\u2019t see a way at all that Bauhaus could stay in business,\" Hurst said.",

      "Minnesota's Democratic U.S. senators, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, are among those strategizing to save the industry. Klobuchar noted at a recent news conference that the ban was inserted into the unrelated shutdown bill without a hearing. She suggested the federal government could allow states to develop their own regulatory frameworks, or that Minnesota's strict regulations could be used as a national model.",

      "Florida has hired Jon Sumrall from Tulane as football coach, after Lane Kiffin chose LSU over the Gators",
      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Florida hired Tulane\u2019s Jon Sumrall as football coach Sunday, settling for its second choice after Lane Kiffin picked LSU over the Gators.",
      "Sumrall finalized a six-year, $44.7 million contract that comes with incentives, according to a person familiar with the search. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because financial details were not released. The deal averages $7.45 million annually.",
      "The 43-year-old Sumrall will remain with the 22nd-ranked Green Wave for the American Conference title game next week and through the College Football Playoff if Tulane makes the 12-team field.",
      "The Gators also agreed to terms with longtime NFL executive Dave Caldwell as their general manager. Caldwell won a Super Bowl during his five seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles and built a roster that made the AFC title game in eight years (2013-20) with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He also spent time with Atlanta, Indianapolis and Carolina.",
      "Caldwell is expected to help manage Florida's salary cap and evaluate talent \u2014 essentially taking some things off Sumrall's plate as college football moves closer to adopting NFL-style front offices.",
      "Sumrall played linebacker at Kentucky (2002-04) and returned to his alma mater for a three-year stint before becoming Troy\u2019s head coach in 2022. He won consecutive Sun Belt championships in two seasons with the Trojans and then enjoyed similar success at Tulane.",
      "Sumrall is 19-7 in two years in New Orleans and led the Green Wave to the American championship game both seasons. So he has made four league title games in four years as a head coach. The Gators are hoping he's Urban Meyer 2.0 and not Billy Napier 2.0.",
      "\u201cNot many coaches win big at two different non-Power programs, and even fewer do it as quickly as Jon has done it,\u201d Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin said. \"He joins rare company \u2014 coaches like Urban Meyer, Brian Kelly and Willie Fritz \u2014 who\u2019ve delivered immediate success at multiple stops. Jon\u2019s track record of rapid turnarounds speaks directly to his leadership and the culture he establishes.\u201d",
      "Sumrall had been considered a possibility at Auburn, Arkansas and Ole Miss. Florida made a late push when Kiffin\u2019s interest in the Gators waned. Florida fans are likely to view him as a consolation prize, another gamble from a Group of Five conference.",
      "Sumrall replaces Napier, who was fired in mid-October and went 22-23 over four seasons in Gainesville. Napier was nicknamed \u201cSun Belt Billy\u201d because he often looked in over his head in the powerhouse Southeastern Conference.",
      "Going back to Louisiana for another G5 coach? And a defensive guy to boot? That\u2019s a bold move for Stricklin, who is sure to draw the ire of the Florida faithful for failing to land Kiffin.",
      "He was roundly booed at a championship celebration to honor men\u2019s basketball coach Todd Golden and his title-winning team in April. Now, the fan base is calling for his job.",

      "But Stricklin seemingly has the support of the Board of Trustees, which gave him a three-year contract extension in June and allowed him to conduct a coaching search that included roughly 10 interviews without interference.",
      "There were rumors and reports about boosters getting involved and straining relationships with Kiffin and his camp. But Stricklin made it clear he was the only one making the hire. Kiffin chose LSU after a public tug-of-war involving all three schools.",
      "Kiffin\u2019s family members took scouting trips to Gainesville and Baton Rouge, and he met with administrators and fundraisers on several occasions. The trip to Gainesville was underwhelming, according to people familiar with the search, and high school football in the area left plenty to be desired.",
      "Florida even turned to Heisman Trophy winners Steve Spurrier and Danny Wuerffel during its pursuit of Kiffin, who eventually slowed communication with UF officials to the point where the Gators decided they had to move on in a crowded market.",
      "Now, Sumrall will be counted on to lead a downtrodden program back to prominence in the powerhouse Southeastern Conference.",
      "Tulane\u2019s numbers are far from gaudy: The Green Wave rank 39th in the country in total offense and 64th in total defense. Sumrall is expected to hire outside coordinators to help him rebuild in Gainesville.",
      "The Gators (4-8) clearly have talent and ended a dismal season with one of their best performances, a 40-21 victory against rival Florida State in the Swamp in which running back Jadan Baugh ran for a career-high 266 yards and two touchdowns and DJ Lagway threw for three scores.",

      "The Buffalo Bills have bounced back from a loss at Houston by pushing around the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 26-7 win",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills came to Pittsburgh looking for something \u2014 anything, really \u2014 to snap themselves out of a midseason lull that had robbed them of their swagger, not to mention their usual grip on first place in the AFC East.",
      "The Bills found it during three hours of remarkably simple and remarkably effective football in a 26-7 victory on Sunday that made up for in sheer force what it lacked in style.",
      "Allen threw for a touchdown and ran for another, Joey Bosa sacked Aaron Rodgers to spring Christian Benford for a game-tilting, 17-yard scoop-and-score, and the Bills (8-4) set an Acrisure Stadium record by piling up 249 yards rushing while whipping the reeling Steelers.",
      "\u201cFound a way to win, that's all that matters,\u201d said Allen, last season's MVP.",
      "Maybe, but the Bills may also have found something that could be effective down the stretch.",
      "Playing without their starting offensive tackles and coming off a loss at Houston in which Allen was sacked eight times, Buffalo responded by opting to gash the Steelers. James Cook ran for 144 yards, Ray Davis added 62 and Allen chipped in 38, including the 76th rushing touchdown of his career, the most by a quarterback.",
      "Allen demurred when asked about breaking the mark of 75 previously held by Cam Newton, saying that's not why he plays. Still, his bulldozing 8-yard score early in the fourth quarter that put the game out of reach was symbolic of a day when Buffalo absorbed a couple of blows from the Steelers and kept on chugging.",
      "Allen juked past one defender, then fought off three more while his teammates dragged him across the goal line.",
      "\u201cThe line coming to throw me in there was pretty cool,\u201d Allen said.",
      "And pretty alarming for Pittsburgh (6-6). On a blustery day that made passing treacherous, the Steelers knew they were going to be tested by one of the NFL's best rushing teams. They failed repeatedly. Buffalo held the ball for nearly 42 minutes and probably could have taken control earlier if not for a pair of first-half turnovers.",
      "\u201cThat's an awful performance by us,\" Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said.",
      "The Steelers have dropped five of seven since a 4-1 start. While they remain tied with Baltimore atop the AFC North, they have not looked competitive at times against quality opponents during a funk that shows little sign of abating.",
      "Rodgers, playing with a brace protecting his broken left wrist, was largely ineffective and missed the chunk of one drive early in the second half after getting drilled by Bosa on the first play of the third quarter.",
      "The four-time MVP fumbled on the play, and Benford picked up the loose ball and sprinted to the end zone to turn a 7-3 halftime deficit into a 10-7 lead. The 41-year-old quarterback left the field with a bloody nose.",
      "Mason Rudolph filled in for Rodgers for a series and threw an interception that ended up in Benford\u2019s hands. Buffalo marched 56 yards in eight plays, and Allen\u2019s fourth-down flip to Coleman gave the Bills firm control.",
      "Rodgers returned but finished 10 of 21 for 117 yards as the Steelers lost for the fifth time in seven games while being booed frequently.",

      "\u201cIt's kind of scary, because I know they're coming,\u201d he said.",

      "Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season",
      "NEW YORK -- Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season, hoping to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending.",
      "Although AI-powered purchases are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted \u201cconversations\u201d with customers.",
      "Those features are on top of shopping updates from AI platforms like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In one of the season's most talked-about launches, Google this month introduced an AI agent that can be instructed to call local stores to ask if a desired product is in stock.",
      "San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI would influence $73 billion, or 22%, of all global sales in one way or another from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Monday after the holiday, according to Caila Schwartz, Salesforce\u2019s director of consumer insights.",
      "The figure, which stood at $60 billion a year ago, encompasses everything from a ChatGPT query to AI-supplied gift suggestions on a retailer\u2019s website, Schwartz said.",
      "Despite the advancements, AI\u2019s impact on holiday shopping will be \u201crelatively limited\u201d this year since not every shopping site has useful tools and not every shopper is willing to try them, said Brad Jashinsky, a senior retail industry analyst at information technology research and consulting firm Gartner.",
      "\u201cThe more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,\u201d Jashinsky said. \"But customer behavior takes a long time to change.\u201d",
      "Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025:",
      "AI's potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks.",
      "OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers' guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user's previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for \u201cdetail-heavy\u201d items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said.",
      "Then there's Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user's browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations.",
      "Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans,",
      "Responses are pulled from Google's 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed.",
      "\u201cThis is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,\u201d Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, Walmart\u2019s AI shopping assistant, Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target's app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient.",
      "Tools for tracking online prices have been around for years, including CamelCamelCamel, a third-party service for Amazon prices, as well as Paypal\u2019s Honey browser extension for monitoring thousands of online shops.",

      "Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, said he thinks the new pricing tools will add more pressure on retailers to make sure their prices are competitive.",
      "\u201cA lot of consumers that weren\u2019t even looking for price alerts are going to discover price alerts for the first time,\u201d Goldberg predicted.",
      "Amazon, OpenAI and Google are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking consumers from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase.",
      "OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx.",
      "OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart\u2019s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time.",
      "A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app.",
      "New tools from Amazon and Google will give shoppers a taste of having autonomous AI assistants do the buying for them. While the services still are limited, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say.",
      "Amazon is now letting Rufus automatically purchase items for customers who click an \u201cauto buy\u201d button while setting up price alerts. Once a product's price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said.",
      "The e-commerce giant also started allowing shoppers to use Rufus searches for brand-name products on the Amazon app as a gateway to other retailers. If Amazon doesn't carry a desired item in its store, a \u201cShop Direct\u201d button will take them to the website of a place that does.",
      "Google's AI Mode price tracker also includes a \u201cbuy for me\u201d option that automatically makes a customer's purchase through Google Pay when the price is right. The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers.",
      "Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google's program discloses to the store that it's an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said.",
      "Google said it's applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys, health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans.",

      "Ukrainians in the southern city of Kherson live in constant fear of Russian drone attacks",
      "KHERSON, Ukraine -- When Olena Horlova leaves home or drives through town outside the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, she fears that she's a target. She believes that Russian drones could be waiting on a rooftop, along the road or aiming for her car.",
      "To protect herself and her two daughters, the girls stay indoors, and she stays alert \u2014 sometimes returning home at night along dark roads without headlights so as not to be seen.",
      "After living through the occupation, refusing to cooperate with Russian forces and hiding from them, Horlova, like so many other residents, found that even after her town was liberated in 2022, the ordeal didn't end.",
      "Kherson was among the first places where Russian forces began using short-range, first-person view, or FPV, drones against civilians. The drones are equipped with livestreaming cameras that let operators see and select their targets in real time. The tactic later spread more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) along the right bank of the Dnipro River, across the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions.",
      "The United Nations' Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks leave little doubt about their intent. In an October report, the commission said that the attacks have repeatedly killed and wounded civilians, destroyed homes and forced thousands to flee, concluding that they amount to the crimes against humanity of murder and forcible transfer.",
      "\u201cWe live with the hope that one day this will finally end,\u201d Horlova said, her voice trembling. \u201cWhat matters for us is a cease-fire, or for the front line to be pushed further away. Then it would be easier for us.\u201d",
      "Horlova lives in Komyshany, a village just outside Kherson and only 4 kilometers (2\u00bd miles) from the Dnipro River, where the level of intense attacks has remained the same, despite Ukrainian forces retaking the city from Russian occupation in November 2022 \u2014 about nine months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 of that year.",
      "But the war didn't end there. Instead, it shifted into a phase in which the area has effectively become what locals and the military term a \u201chuman safari,\u201d describing it as a testing ground where people are often the target of drone attacks.",
      "Horlova says that FPVs often land on rooftops when their batteries run low and then wait out.",
      "\u201cWhen people, cars or even a cyclist appear, the drone suddenly lifts off and drops the explosive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where they even drop them on animals \u2014 cows, goats.\u201d",
      "She believes that civilians are hunted as \u201crevenge\u201d for the celebrations that broke out when Kherson was liberated.",
      "The report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks have spread terror among civilians and violated their right to life and other fundamental human rights. Investigators found that Russian units on the occupied left bank of the Dnipro carried out the strikes and identified specific drone units, operators and commanders involved. They also noted that Russian Telegram channels routinely share videos of the attacks, often with mocking captions and threats of more.",
      "The U.N. commission said that it examined Russian claims that Ukrainian forces had launched drone attacks on civilians in occupied areas, unable to conclude its investigation because it lacked access to the territory, couldn't ensure witness safety and didn't receive answers from Russian authorities.",
      "Interceptions obtained by The Associated Press from the 310th Separate Marine Electronic Warfare Battalion show Russian FPV drones that appear to be hunting for vehicles. The videos capture drones flying low over roads and locking onto moving or parked cars \u2014 often pickups, supply vehicles, sedans and even clearly marked ambulances \u2014 before diving for a strike.",
      "The commander of the 310th Battalion, which protects the skies over 470 kilometers (nearly 300 miles) of southern Ukraine, including Kherson, says at least 300 drones fly toward the city every day. In October alone, the number of drones that flew over Kherson was 9,000.",
      "\u201cThis area is like a training ground,\u201d said the battalion\u2019s commander, Dmytro Liashok, a 16-year military veteran and one of Ukraine\u2019s early pioneers in electronic warfare. \u201cThey bring new Russian crews here to gain experience before sending them elsewhere.\u201d The AP couldn't independently verify the claim.",

      "He says patients wounded in Russian attacks, including drone strikes, arrive at the hospital every day. Last month alone, it treated 85 inpatients and 105 outpatients with blast injuries, all from shelling and drone strikes. It's also the only hospital in the area equipped to handle the most serious cases.",

      "Since Marc Buoniconti",
      "Marc Buoniconti said his father, the late NFL Hall of Famer Nick Buoniconti, explained the secret to the success of their nonprofit and its fundraising efforts simply: \u201cWe\u2019re just not good listeners.\u201d",
      "In the 40 years since Marc Buoniconti, then a college football linebacker at the Citadel, was paralyzed during a routine tackle, they have been told countless times that it was a problem that couldn\u2019t be fixed. The Buonicontis didn\u2019t listen.",
      "Instead, through the fund that bears their name, they have helped raise more than $550 million for The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, and improved the lives of millions with spinal cord and brain injuries.",
      "\u201cThe Buoniconti Fund has lasted because we\u2019re relentless,\u201d Marc Buoniconti recently told The Associated Press. \u201cWe never give up. When we see a challenge, we face it head-on and don\u2019t stop until we find a solution. It\u2019s that determination, that refusal to quit that\u2019s kept us going all these years.\u201d",
      "That drive has also led The Miami Project to expand its work beyond curing paralysis. Its research center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine now also studies neurological diseases and disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and it is testing the brain-computer interface implant from Elon Musk\u2019s technology company Neuralink.",
      "Dr. Barth A. Green, chairman of The Miami Project, who co-founded the organization in 1985 with Nick Buoniconti, says the most surprising developments from the center have been the broadest ones.",
      "\u201cEvery operating room in the world that puts people to sleep monitors their nervous system for safety,\u201d Dr. Green said. \u201cThat was all developed at The Miami Project.\u201d",
      "Therapeutic hypothermia, where the body is cooled after an injury to protect the brain and spinal cord, is another widely used treatment developed at the center.",
      "Dr. Green said that before Buoniconti\u2019s accident he had been working on helping those who had been paralyzed for 20 years. Yet there wasn\u2019t a hub for that work until The Miami Project was established.",
      "It provided a home for him and \u201cthousands of scientists and researchers in Miami and around the world, who were equally engaged by the opportunity to change people\u2019s everyday quality of life and their opportunities to have more function and a better opportunity to be mobile and do things they never dreamt they could before.\u201d",
      "Miami Project Scientific Director W. Dalton Dietrich III said gathering those people from a variety of disciplines \u2013 neuroscientists, researchers, clinicians, biomedical engineers \u2013 into one building has led to unexpected advances.",
      "\u201cNot one particular treatment is going to cure paralysis,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve tried to look at other disciplines to bring into the project to help us achieve that goal.\u201d",
      "One new, multidisciplinary area, neuromodulation, is \u201csomething we never thought about five years ago,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an exciting area where you can stimulate these residual circuits after brain injury or spinal cord injury in patients and they start moving their limbs.\u201d",

      "Mark Dalton, chairman and CEO of Tudor Investment Corp., said that belief resonated with him and made him want to get involved with The Buonicontis even before he met them.",

We\u2019ll give so many people their lives back. That\u2019s what keeps me going, and that\u2019s what makes every struggle to this point worth it.\u201d",

      "Tucked in a two-sentence footnote in a voluminous court opinion, a federal judge recently called out immigration agents using artificial intelligence to write use-of-force reports, raising concerns that it could lead to inaccuracies and further erode public confidence in how police have handled the immigration crackdown in the Chicago area and ensuing protests.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis wrote the footnote in a 223-page opinion issued last week, noting that the practice of using ChatGPT to write use-of-force reports undermines the agents\u2019 credibility and \u201cmay explain the inaccuracy of these reports.\u201d She described what she saw in at least one body camera video, writing that an agent asks ChatGPT to compile a narrative for a report after giving the program a brief sentence of description and several images.",
      "The judge noted factual discrepancies between the official narrative about those law enforcement responses and what body camera footage showed. But experts say the use of AI to write a report that depends on an officer\u2019s specific perspective without using an officer\u2019s actual experience is the worst possible use of the technology and raises serious concerns about accuracy and privacy.",
      "Law enforcement agencies across the country have been grappling with how to create guardrails that allow officers to use the increasingly available AI technology while maintaining accuracy, privacy and professionalism. Experts said the example recounted in the opinion didn't meet that challenge.",
      "\u201cWhat this guy did is the worst of all worlds. Giving it a single sentence and a few pictures \u2014 if that\u2019s true, if that\u2019s what happened here \u2014 that goes against every bit of advice we have out there. It\u2019s a nightmare scenario,\u201d said Ian Adams, assistant criminology professor at the University of South Carolina who serves on a task force on artificial intelligence through the Council for Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear if the agency had guidelines or policies on the use of AI by agents. The body camera footage cited in the order has not yet been released.",
      "Adams said few departments have put policies in place, but those that have often prohibit the use of predictive AI when writing reports justifying law enforcement decisions, especially use-of-force reports. Courts have established a standard referred to as objective reasonableness when considering whether a use of force was justified, relying heavily on the perspective of the specific officer in that specific scenario.",
      "\u201cWe need the specific articulated events of that event and the specific thoughts of that specific officer to let us know if this was a justified use of force,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat is the worst case scenario, other than explicitly telling it to make up facts, because you\u2019re begging it to make up facts in this high-stakes situation.\u201d",
      "Besides raising concerns about an AI-generated report inaccurately characterizing what happened, the use of AI also raises potential privacy concerns.",
      "Katie Kinsey, chief of staff and tech policy counsel at the Policing Project at NYU School of Law, said if the agent in the order was using a public ChatGPT version, he probably didn't understand he lost control of the images the moment he uploaded them, allowing them to be part of the public domain and potentially used by bad actors.",
      "Kinsey said from a technology standpoint most departments are building the plane as it\u2019s being flown when it comes to AI. She said it\u2019s often a pattern in law enforcement to wait until new technologies are already being used and in some cases mistakes being made to then talk about putting guidelines or policies in place.",

      "BROOKLINE, Mass. -- For the past several years, 75-year-old Miguel Laboy has smoked a joint with his coffee every morning. He tells himself he won\u2019t start tomorrow the same way, but he usually does.",
      "\u201cYou know what bothers me? To have cannabis on my mind the first thing in the morning,\u201d he said, sparking a blunt in his Brookline, Mass., apartment. \u201cI\u2019d like to get up one day and not smoke. But you see how that\u2019s going.\u201d",
      "Since legalization and commercialization, daily cannabis use has become a defining \u2014 and often invisible \u2014 part of many people\u2019s lives. High-potency vapes and concentrates now dominate the market, and doctors say they can blur the line between relief and dependence over time so that users don\u2019t notice the shift. Across the country, people who turned to cannabis for help are finding it harder to put down.",
      "Overall, alcohol remains more widely used than cannabis. But starting in 2022, the number of daily cannabis users in the U.S. surpassed that of daily drinkers \u2014 a major shift in American habits.",
      "Researchers say the rise has unfolded alongside products that contain far more THC than the marijuana of past decades, including vape oils and concentrates that can reach 80% to 95% THC. Massachusetts, like most states, sets no limit on how strong these products can be.",
      "Doctors warn that daily, high-potency use can cloud memory, disturb sleep, intensify anxiety or depression and trigger addiction in ways earlier generations didn\u2019t encounter. Many who develop cannabis use disorder say it\u2019s hard to recognize the signs because of the widespread belief that marijuana isn\u2019t addictive. Because the consequences tend to creep in gradually \u2014 brain fog, irritability, dependence \u2014 users often miss when therapeutic use shifts into compulsion.",
      "Laboy, a retired chef, began seeing a substance-use counselor after telling his doctor he felt depressed, unmotivated and increasingly isolated as his drinking and cannabis use escalated.",
      "Naltrexone helped him quit alcohol, but he hasn\u2019t found a way to quit marijuana. Unlike alcohol and opioids, there is no FDA-approved medication to treat cannabis addiction, though research is underway.",
      "Laboy, who first smoked at 18, said marijuana has long soothed symptoms tied to undiagnosed ADHD, childhood trauma and painful experiences \u2014 including cancer treatment and his son's death. Through decades in restaurant kitchens, he considered himself a \u201cfunctional pothead.\u201d",
      "Lately, though, his use has become compulsive. After retiring, he began vaping 85% THC cartridges.",
      "\u201cThese days, I carry two things in my hands: my vape and my cellular \u2014 that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it, but it\u2019s the reality.\u201d",
      "Cannabis eases his anxiety and \u201csettles his spirit,\u201d but he\u2019s noticed it affects his concentration. He hopes to learn to read music, but sustaining focus at the piano has grown difficult.",
      "He\u2019s seen an addiction psychiatrist for six months, but he hasn\u2019t been able to cut back. The medical system doesn\u2019t seem equipped to help, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not ready yet,\u201d Laboy said. \u201cI go to them for help, but all they say is, \u2018Try to smoke less.\u2019 I already know that \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m there.\u201d",

      "Monday's ruling marks the first time a federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's attempt to keep interim U.S. attorneys in their posts after their temporary appointments lapse, potentially resulting in nationwide implications\u00a0for federal prosecutors installed in the same way as Habba.",
      "\"The court's decision affirms that U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is unlawfully and invalidly serving as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey, marking the first time an appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions,\" attorneys Abbe Lowell, Gerry Krovatin and Norm Eisen, who argued for Habba's dismissal, said in a joint statement.\u00a0 \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. Attorneys wherever appropriate.\"",
      "After Habba's interim appointment expired and the district court sought to put in a new top prosecutor, the Trump administration placed her in a lower position -- First Assistant U.S. Attorney -- that allowed her to assume the top job once her original nomination was withdrawn.",
      "In a 3-0 decision, the appeals court concluded that Habba's original nomination for the U.S. attorney position barred her from assuming the acting job. The court also rejected the argument that the attorney general has the power to delegate the powers of U.S. attorney to Habba.",
      "The ruling from the three-judge panel -- composed of two judges put on the bench by George W. Bush and one by Joe Biden -- comes on the heels of a high-profile decision last week disqualifying Trump's handpicked prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, who had brought criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",

      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",

      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers from both parties said Sunday they support congressional reviews of U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, citing a published report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for all crew members to be killed as part of a Sept. 2 attack.",
      "The lawmakers said they did not know whether last week's Washington Post report was true, and some Republicans were skeptical, but they said attacking survivors of an initial missile strike poses serious legal concerns.",
      "\u201cThis rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no long able to fight, said Congress does not have information that happened. He noted that leaders of the Armed Services Committee in both the House and Senate have opened investigations.",
      "\u201cObviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,\u201d Turner said.",
      "Turner said there are concerns in Congress about the attacks on vessels that the Trump administration says are transporting drugs, but the allegations regarding the Sept. 2 attack \u201cis completely outside anything that has been discussed with Congress and there is an ongoing investigation.\u201d",
      "The comments from lawmakers during news show appearance come as the administration escalates a campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. On Saturday, Republican President Donald Trump said the airspace \u201cabove and surrounding\u201d Venezuela should be considered as \u201cclosed in its entirety,\u201d an assertion that raised more questions about the U.S. pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Maduro's government accused Trump of making a \u201dcolonial threat\u201d and seeking to undermine the South American country\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "After the Post's report, Hegseth said Friday on X that \u201cfake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.\u201d",
      "\"Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict\u2014and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,\" Hegseth wrote.",

      "Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., asked about the Sept. 2 attack, said Hegseth deserves a chance to present his side.",

I don\u2019t think he would be foolish enough to make this decision to say, kill everybody, kill the survivors because that\u2019s a clear violation of the law of war,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m very suspicious that he would\u2019ve done something like that because it would go against common sense.\u201d",

      "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was once critical of English",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- English phrases once bothered Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro so much that he urged his State of the Union address audience to phase out words like skatepark and fashion.",
      "But as the White House now ponders whether the U.S. military should strike Venezuela, Maduro is embracing English, singing John Lennon\u2019s Imagine, advocating for peace and dancing to a remix of his latest English catchphrase, \u201cNo War, Yes Peace.\u201d",
      "While his turnaround is seen as a sign of desperation by supporters of Venezuela\u2019s political opposition, whose leaders have repeatedly told their backers in Washington that the threat of military action would crack Maduro\u2019s inner circle, months of pressure have yet to produce defections or a government transition.",
      "Behind this knack for staying in power is a system that punishes disloyal associates harshly and allows loyal ministers, justices, military leaders and other officials to enrich themselves.",
      "\u201cThe Bolivarian Revolution possesses a remarkable ability: the capacity for cohesion in the face of external pressure,\u201d Ronal Rodr\u00edguez, a researcher at the Venezuela Observatory in Colombia\u2019s Universidad del Rosario, said referring to the political movement, also known as Chavismo, that Maduro inherited from the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cWhen pressure comes from abroad, they manage to unite, defend and protect themselves.\"",
      "Underpinning the loyalty-or-punishment principle are corruption networks blessed by Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro that give the loyal permission to get richer. The policy has vexed previous efforts to unseat Maduro and has helped him and his close associates to skirt economic sanctions, obtain U.S. presidential pardons and claim an electoral victory they resoundingly lost.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez explained that prison and torture can be part of the punishment, which is usually harsher for accused wrongdoers with military affiliation. The strategy has been crucial for an authoritarian Maduro to keep control of the military, which he lets traffic drugs, oil, wildlife and myriad goods in exchange for coup-proof barracks.",
      "\u201cThis has been a very effective tool because Chavismo has always been able to eliminate those actors who at some point try to rise up, and it has been able to expose corrupt practices from all sorts of actors,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s political opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, had banked on the military\u2019s support to dislodge Maduro after credible evidence showed that he lost the 2024 presidential election. But Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez and other military leaders stood by Maduro, just like they did in 2019 during a barracks revolt by a cadre of soldiers who swore loyalty to Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader recognized at the time by the first Trump administration as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader.",
      "Since returning to office, U.S. President Donald Trump has increased the pressure on Maduro and his allies, including by doubling to $50 million the reward for information that leads to his arrest on narcoterrorism charges. A 2020 indictment accused Maduro of leading the Cartel de los Soles, which the U.S. State Department on Monday designated as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Maduro denies the accusations.",
      "On Saturday, Trump said that the airspace \u201cabove and surrounding\u201d the South American country should be considered as \u201cclosed in its entirety.\" Maduro's government responded by accusing Trump of making a \u201dcolonial threat,\u201d rallying supporters behind what it called an assault on national sovereignty.",
      "In early September, the U.S. military began blowing up boats that the Trump administration has accused of transporting drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Many, including Maduro himself, see the U.S. military moves as an effort to end Chavismo\u2019s hold on power. The opposition only added to this perception by reigniting its promise to remove Maduro from office.",

      "Two weeks after the first boat strike, Chavismo\u2019s loyalty was tested directly when Maduro\u2019s pilot rebuffed efforts from the U.S. to join a plot to capture the Venezuelan leader and deliver him into custody to face the charges.",
      "\u201cWe Venezuelans are cut from a different cloth,\u201d Bitner Villegas, a member of the elite presidential honor guard, wrote to a retired U.S. officer trying to recruit him. \u201cThe last thing we are is traitors.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, ruling party supporters marched in Caracas to demonstrate what they described as the \u201canti-imperialist spirit\u201d of Chavismo. The march ended in a ceremony in which Maduro raised a jeweled sword that belonged to South American independence hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and guided attendees, including Cabinet ministers, to swear in God\u2019s name to defend peace and freedom.",
      "Susan Shirk, a research professor at the University of California, San Diego, said authoritarian leaders have a \u201cfetish for unity\u201d and like public displays of loyalty to prevent splits among leadership and social upheaval. She explained that division can lead people to believe that the risk of protesting has lessened.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the designation of Cartel de los Soles provides Trump with additional options for dealing with Maduro. Hegseth hasn't provided details on those options, but administration officials have signaled that they have trouble seeing a situation in which Maduro is still in power as an acceptable endgame.",
      "David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for more than three decades, said that only people who don't understand Chavismo would think that a show of force will cause a government change.",
      "\u201cThis is exactly the type of thing that unifies them,\u201d Smilde said of the deployment of U.S. military forces. \u201cThey also talk about the $50 million reward, but what military officer in their right mind would trust the U.S. government? And more broadly, if the whole premise of the operation is that the Venezuelan armed forces are a drug cartel, what motivation could they possibly have to turn on Maduro and participate in regime change?\u201d",
      "Maduro's entire presidency has been marked by a political, social and economic crisis that has pushed millions into poverty and driven more than 7.7 million people to migrate. The crisis has also caused support for the ruling party to plummet across the country.",
      "With loyalty keeping his inner circle intact despite mounting U.S. pressure, Maduro has also sought to maintain his diminished base through the long-established practices that include organizing marches in the capital.",
      "Zenaida Quintero, a school porter, has seen the country come undone under Maduro\u2019s watch, with vivid memories of the severe food shortages that Venezuelans experienced in the late 2010s. Her support for Maduro, however, hasn't wavered, and her commitment comes down to one fact: He was handpicked by Ch\u00e1vez to lead the Bolivarian Revolution.",
      "Quintero, 60, said that Maduro, like Ch\u00e1vez, won't abandon his supporters.",
      "\u201cI trust him,\u201d Quintero said of Maduro. \u201cWe have to remain united. We have to defend ourselves.\u201d",

      "STOCKTON, Calif. -- Authorities in California appealed to the public for tips, cellphone video, witness accounts and even rumors as they searched Sunday for a suspect in the killing of three children and an adult during a mass shooting at a child's birthday party.",
      "Someone opened fire at a banquet hall in Stockton where 100 people or more had gathered on Saturday, San Joaquin County Sheriff Patrick Withrow told reporters. He said detectives believe the gunfire continued outside and there may have been multiple shooters.",
      "Withrow said the deceased were ages 8, 9, 14 and 21. Eleven people were also wounded, with at least one in critical condition, he said. No one was in custody by Sunday evening, and the sheriff urged anyone with information to contact his office.",
      "\u201cThis is a time for our community to show that we will not put up with this type of behavior, when people will just walk in and kill children,\u201d Withrow said during a Sunday media briefing. \u201cAnd so if you know anything about this, you have to come forward and tell us what you know. If not, you just become complacent and think this is acceptable behavior.\u201d",
      "Sheriff's spokesperson Heather Brent said earlier that investigators believe it was a \u201ctargeted incident.\" Officials did not elaborate on why authorities believe it was intentional or who might have been targeted.",
      "Roscoe Brown said the party was in honor of his brother's granddaughter, who turned 2 years old and was uninjured. Brown, who works for the city of Stockton's Office of Violence Prevention, was in Arizona when he learned about the shooting and drove straight to the scene. He said a niece and nephew of his were shot, and he knows several other victims. He didn't have information about their conditions.",
      "\u201cWho would come and do that to some kids, you know?\u201d Brown told The Associated Press following a vigil organized by faith leaders to honor the dead and pray for the wounded. \u201cYou can\u2019t shoot up a party. That\u2019s senseless. A kid's party, at that.\u201d",
      "The shooting occurred just before 6 p.m. Saturday inside the hall, which shares a parking lot with other businesses in the city of 320,000 residents about 80 miles (130 kilometers) east of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cThis was a birthday party for a young child, and the fact that this happened is absolutely heartbreaking,\" Brent told reporters. She said investigators would welcome any information, \u201ceven rumors.\u201d",
      "District Attorney Ron Freitas urged the shooter to \"turn yourself in immediately.\u201d",
      "Hours after the shooting, the Stockton Police Department arrested five people, including a juvenile, on weapons and gang-related charges. There was no indication that the arrests were connected to the killings at the banquet hall, the sheriff said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/avatar-fire-and-ash-director-james-cameron-on-generative-ai-thats-horrifying-to-me/",
    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:44:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Avatar\" director, who uses performance capture to help create fantasy characters, has consistently raised the level of movie visual effects. But James Cameron believes using artificial intelligence to create a character and performance without an actor is \"horrifying.\"",
    "story": [
      "Much of what we see from the Earth-like moon of Pandora, the fantastical setting for the \"Avatar\" franchise, comes from a soundstage in Los Angeles, where scenes from the second and third movies were filmed. \"We had to build an ocean,\" director James Cameron said. \"We could make a two-meter swell. We could make a wave crash up on a shoreline if we built the shoreline.\"",
      "Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Salda\u00f1a  and other actors shot their underwater scenes in the nearly 250,000-gallon tank. Digital artists then took those shots, called performance captures, as a template to render the final versions of the characters we see on screen.",
      "\"So, performance capture, we use a whole bunch of cameras to capture the body performance of the actor,\" Cameron explained. \"And we use a single camera (or now we use actually two) to video their face. They're in a close-up 100% of the time. But there's a beautiful thing about being in a close-up 100% of the time. It's very much like theater rehearsal.\"",
      "\"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" is the third film in the series. It tells the story of the indigenous Na'vis' fight to defend their paradise from colonizing humans.",
      "Cameron created these stories and this world. He's always been a dreamer, even as a kid in rural Canada. \"I lived in a world of my imagination \u2013 it was comic books, it was science fiction. I read a lot. There were movies, TV shows,\" he said. \"I mean, I had a pretty fertile imagination.\"",
      "Cameron moved to Los Angeles with his parents as a teen. He briefly attended community college, where studies included marine biology, before dropping out and picking up odd jobs, including truck driving.",
      "So, how did he go from blue collar to Hollywood? \"Watching 'Star Wars,'\" he said. \"I used to put my headphones on and listen to fast electronic music and imagine space battles, hyperkinetic space battles with all kinds of maneuvers and energy weapons, and people going through debris fields and all that. If the things I'm seeing in my mind can be the same things that are in a movie that's the number one movie in movie history, then I've got a salable imagination.\"",
      "He returned to school, although not in an official capacity. \"I started to study visual effects, and the way I did it was, I didn't have the money to go to USC or anything like that. So what I used to do is, I'd go down to USC, I'd go bury myself on a Saturday, when I wasn't driving a truck, in the stacks. And I'd read everything I could find on optical printing and front-screen projection and, you know, sodium process traveling mattes. All self-taught. I'd Xerox all these scholarly papers, put them all in binders. And I had this shelf full of black binders that had essentially a graduate course in visual effects and cinematography.\"",
      "He found jobs in visual effects departments and production design, rising through the ranks quickly due to his technical knowledge.",
      "Then, in the early 1980s, Cameron, inspired by a literal dream about a robot exoskeleton, co-wrote and directed \"The Terminator.\" The movie put him on the map, and proved he could turn his imagination into reality.",
      "But CGI wasn't available at the time; the effects were done largely through puppeteering. \"We just figured out how to do it all practically,\" Cameron said.",
      "He showed us around his private museum in Los Angeles, full of movie props from his films, including \"Aliens,\" where puppeteers brought Sigourney Weaver's powerlifter - and the Alien Queen \u2013 to life. Of the Alien Queen, Cameron said, \"Her head had, I think, seven or eight different axes of movement that were controlled by cables that went basically out her butt. And we had to hide all that stuff, so there was a lotta steam and smoke and backlight and things like that.\"",
      "Cameron's first use of CGI came with the science fiction movie \"The Abyss,\" It was also his first cinematic foray into another one of his fascinations: the deep sea. His second venture into an oceanic film? \"Titanic.\" It became the then-highest-grossing movie of all time. Cameron took home three Oscars himself.",
      "But the film itself was never the priority for Cameron: He said he wrote the script in order to explore the wreck of the Titanic. \"It was a little bit of a means to an end, you know?\" he said. \"I thought, 'I can just go do this. All right, I need a story. Okay, 'Romeo and Juliet.' You know, young, doomed love on the Titanic.' Boom! Like, instantaneous.\"",
      "He found a way to use Hollywood to invest in his passion for scientific exploration. \"Yeah, exactly,\" he said. \"And then I had so much fun on my expedition that was to shoot Titanic for the movie, that I basically took an eight-year hiatus from Hollywood, an eight-year sabbatical. And I did subsequently six more expeditions for a total of seven, before I started 'Avatar.'\"",
      "Cameron wrote the treatment for \"Avatar\" before \"Titanic,\" but it wasn't until 2005 that he thought the current technology could support his vision. And even then, he wasn't sure the business of Hollywood would go along. \"For years, there was this sense that, 'Oh, they're doing something strange with computers and they're replacing actors,' when in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we're doing, it's a celebration of the actor-director moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Now, go to the other end of the spectrum, and you've got generative AI, where they can make up a character,\" he continued. \"They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It's like, no. That's horrifying to me. That's the opposite. That's exactly what we're not doing.\"",
      "Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" opens next months.",
      "So, how does he feel a few weeks from the premiere? \"Nervous!\" he laughed. \"Are you kidding? Always. Always.\"",
      "Despite the uncertainty, Cameron is still undaunted, and enamored by the unknown. \"I'm attracted, in case you haven't noticed, by things I don't know how to do,\" he said. \"Because you grow and you learn. If I'm still making movies when I got an oxygen tube up my nose and I'm 87 or whatever, should I be that lucky, I want to still be doing things I don't know how to do.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 10:03:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The heavy metal band has not only changed lives with their music; they've also changed lives with their philanthropy \u2013 from donations to food banks and disaster relief, to their charity, All Within My Hands, which has donated to workforce education and other critical services.",
    "story": [
      "Carmen DeBerry is a newly-minted commercial delivery driver in Baltimore, Maryland. She says having this new job has completely changed her life. \"It feels awesome,\" she said. \"You know, I take care of my daughter, and I also take care of my mother.\"",
      "The commercial driver's license, like the type DeBerry got at the Community College of Baltimore County, can cost up to $7,500, money she didn't have \u2013 which is where four kind of unlikely guys from the Bay Area stepped in.",
      "Yes, we are talking about the guys from the band Metallica, one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, with more than 180 million records sold. \"I mean, to be honest, I didn't know when I first signed up that it was through Metallica; they just called it a scholarship,\" DeBerry said.",
      "A Metallica Scholarship, to be precise, part of the more than $10 million the band's charity All Within My Hands has donated to workforce education, mostly in the form of grants through trade schools and community colleges.",
      "\"Not everyone is built for college, and not everyone needs college,\" said Metallica lead singer James Hetfield. And he should know; he himself is the son of a truck driver, something he's hasn't forgotten.",
      "\"It was very evident during COVID, you know, when we weren't able to go out and do our thing,\" said Hetfield. \"But the plumber, the electrician, the truck driver, the people that needed to help keep America running were there. And thank God for them. You know, my thought is that the next millionaires will be the tradesmen.\"",
      "\"We all came from, I mean, pretty humble beginnings,\" said Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, who worked in construction before he became a professional musician. \"At a certain point you realize, like, hey, you know, we're selling tickets, we're doing well, the ship's not sinking. What can we do to make people's lives better?\"",
      "The band's philanthropy actually began with the simple question of what to do with their leftover food backstage at the sports arenas and stadiums they'd been playing. They started donating it to local food banks; then, they starting donating sizable checks to those food banks as well, which turned into disaster relief.",
      "\"It was a bit profound for us because one of the first things that happened was in, maybe 2017, we had the Northern California fires that affected so many people in the Bay Area,\" said guitarist Kirk Hammett. When disaster struck in the band's backyard, that's when he says it hit home: \"And we were able to, like, jump in and, like, really help people right off the bat. And there's been other instances where there's been earthquakes, you know, disasters, people in need of food and medicine. And we've been able to step up and send money, and not just a pittance, but like enough money that makes a difference to, you know, a good group of people who need it.\"",
      "But actually talking about their charity work publicly? That didn't come as easily, says drummer Lars Ulrich. \"We had never screamed from the rooftops about it,\" he said. \"I think instinctively you just want to help. I mean, we all depend on each other \u2013 you know, if you really want to break it down, then you go, humans are herd animals and really thrive, you know, the flock does better when everybody is doing well.\"",
      "Now, if all this doesn't sound very Metallica-like, well, in a way neither does the annual fundraiser concert that they've been putting on in Los Angeles. Last year it raised $3.5 million and brought in some big Metallica admirers, like Aquaman himself Jason Momoa. \"They've kind of been the soundtrack of my life, man. I've kind of discovered them probably when I was ten years old. And I think these are your heroes. These are my heroes.\"",
      "It might come as a surprise to some that a band with songs like \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Seek and Destroy\" spends so much time thinking about how to better other people's lives. But for Hetfield, it's a thought process that comes with age.",
      "\"It seems clearer that we have a purpose,\" he said. \"And that purpose is to bring joy to people on this planet, and absolutely still blows my mind that there's three generations out there, you know, rocking out to 'Master of Puppets.' Like, really? You like this song? Okay! That was written when I was 22 years old, and I was pissed off. But beyond what we've done in the music thing, as you get older, you start to see the world in a different light, you know? My philosophy is, you're climbing to the next layer of the high rise. And the older you get, the better the view is of the world, and what you get to see, and where you can be of service. And this is certainly one of them.\"",
      "Up until now, Hetfield had never actually met a Metallica scholar, but that changed backstage before a show in Landover, Maryland, when a very appreciative Carmen DeBerry stopped by. \"I really think that your scholarship, me telling them about your scholarship, is what got me the job,\" she told Hetfield. \"Because once I told them that I got the Metallica scholarship, they were like, Whaaaaat? I got an entrance, and they took a chance with me. And I appreciate it.\"",
      "\"Right on!\" Hetfield replied.",
      "I asked, \"You're about to go out and play to thousands and thousands of people, and yet you just had a moment of getting to talk to somebody whose life has been significantly changed from All Within My Hands' charity work. What's that feel like?\"",
      "Hetfield replied, \"It is so amazing. We get to go make some people smile out there, deliver the goods by playing songs that saved us in our lives. And then to create a foundation that's giving back to, you know, the blue collar America? We get to go from thousands that are making big noise, that we know we're impacting, but to get a one-on-one, you know, heart-to-heart with somebody whose life you've changed, it changes mine.\"",

    "summary": "From living on her Upstate New York farm, to her roles in movies like the forthcoming \"The Testament of Ann Lee\" and \"The Housemaid,\" to her battling serious anxiety and OCD, the Oscar-nominee reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
    "story": [
      "Breakfast is served on Amanda Seyfried's Upstate New York farm, which means feeding the horses, the goats, and Cliff, a 35-year-old pony. \"I love it,\" Seyfried said, \"'cause nothing else matters, because they need to get fed. It's a responsibility that, like, keeps me focused on what's important.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it about this place that makes you feel whatever it is that it makes you feel?\"",
      "\"I don't know if you know this, but Hollywood is really \u2026 it's tricky, and it's got a lot of personalities,\" Seyfried replied. \"There are a lot of people that are working in a way that doesn't necessarily make it feel like a safe place. This is exactly what I have always wanted.\"",
      "And she's is not merely putting on a show for the cameras. \"Last night it was raining, it was pouring, and I was doing the same ****. I just didn't look this nice!\" she said.",
      "This is where Seyfried lives, but she goes where the work is, and there's been plenty of it \u2013 as Karen, memorably clueless in \"Mean Girls,\" later as Sophie in the mega-hit \"Mamma Mia!\"",
      "A big change of pace came in 2020, starring as early Hollywood actress Marion Davies in \"Mank.\" The film earned Seyfried an Oscar nomination.",
      "She agrees that she wants to be challenged, badly. \"Because here's the thing: the challenge is within a certain parameter. I have had enough therapy and enough insight and perspective to know what happens when I may fall too deep into something, and I have enough tools and support to not let that happen. So, every time I'd say it's a challenge, it's really hard, and I look back and I'm like, I wouldn't want to do that again! But when I'm in it, it's more than a challenge; it's a new life. I'm being born into something \u2013 a new version of myself.\"",
      "Her commitment is right there on the screen in two movies out next month: the psychological thriller \"The Housemaid,\" co-starring Sydney Sweeney; and the dramatic musical \"The Testament of Ann Lee.\"",
      "In that 18th century story, Seyfried plays Ann Lee, the founder of the Shakers, a religious sect that embraced equality and chastity, even inside of marriage.",
      "\"Her conviction was everything,\" Seyfried said of Lee. \"The coolest thing about her is that she created a utopia. The idea that we're better off working together as equals, it still rings true to this day. Like, if you take away power and control of each other, there's nothing we can't do.\"",
      "The cast received a long standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, while the role has made Seyfried an Oscar contender.",
      "\"It's like, I worked my ass off in this specific experience, and I worked my ass off throughout my career, and I've stayed true to who I am,\" she said. \"I've definitely changed, and evolved, and become a better person. Do I still make mistakes? Uh-huh, yeah. Do I still make bad choices? Yeah! But I'm human, and I'm, like, doing the best I can. And I'm nice. And I'm f****** nice!\" she laughed. \"'Cause there's no other reason not to be.\"",
      "I can testify, she is \u2026 nice! And refreshingly honest. Raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Seyfried studied acting and music as a kid, did some modeling, too. In high school, she was a regular on the soap opera \"All My Children.\" She was on the show for ten months.",
      "Why'd she leave it? \"Why did I leave? Why did Megan McTavish write me off? I don't know, ask her!\" she laughed.",
      "Getting fired, even at 17, hurt. She figured acting was over, so she enrolled at New York's Fordham University, sort of. \"I, like, took the elevator up, and then I stood there, looked at the elevators, and then I took the escalator down, and then I went home. That was my time at Fordham,\" she laughed.",
      "Immediately after \"college,\" Seyfried landed an audition for \"Mean Girls,\" her first big break. \"Mamma Mia!\" was her second. It led to a sequel, 2018's \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\" \u2026 and maybe a trilogy? Asked if there was going to be a third one, she replied, \"Yeah, absolutely.\"",
      "\"Do we know anything about the story?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I think if we all decided we'll do it for free, they'll be like, 'Cool. Let's do it tomorrow,'\" she replied. \"I know Judy Craymer, who created it, is working furiously on a script. I just assume it'll happen exactly ten years from when we shot the last one, which was '17. So, we'll shoot it in 2027, out in 2028. Every ten years! I just don't know how they get Meryl back.\"",
      "Well, that is the tricky part, as her character is (spoiler) dead. Evil twin? \"There it is!\" Seyfried smiled.",
      "Some character traits can stay with Seyfried, like the voice of Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder convicted of fraud in \"The Dropout\" (2022). The role won Seyfried an Emmy.",
      "Seyfried is candid about everything, including battling serious anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, obstacles she believes help her as an actor. \u00a0\"All the things that I have, I've been diagnosed with, I've been able to channel them in the right ways and take the right medication to use it to my advantage,\" she said, \"and to, like, shut it up when it's no longer helpful, for the most part. And that has helped me. Self-loathing, self-judgment, all that, at times helped me keep my s*** together.\"",
      "Seyfried, who turns 40 this week, is married to actor Thomas Sadowski. They have two children. Her daughter was close by during our conversation, as was a guitar. It's one of many instruments Seyfried  plays.",
      "She was looking right at her daughter as she sang.",
      "Seeing her in own house, this farm upstate, surrounded by family and animals, reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
      "\"It's my world now,\" she said. \"Like, I've been in it for 25 years or whatever. And I, like, totally feel at home in it. And people know me well enough, I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I'm nice to people. I'm not trying to cover up any scandals \u2013 yet! Wait! \u2013 and I'm not trying to, you know, hide or, like, run away from any bad press. So it's like, I've made it easy for myself. So far!\"",

We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: \"Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else.\"",
      "Stoppard was born in the Czech Republic in 1937. His family fled to Singapore after Nazi Germany's invasion in 1939. He, his brother and their mother fled again when Japanese forces closed in on the city in 1941. His father died trying to leave the city. His mother married an English officer in 1946, and the family moved to postwar Britain. The 8-year-old Tom \"put on Englishness like a coat,\" he later said, growing up to be a quintessential Englishman who loved cricket and Shakespeare.",
      "Stoppard first worked as a journalist before turning to theater in the 1960s. Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation and was garlanded with honors, including a shelf full of theater gongs.",
      "His brain-teasing plays ranged across Shakespeare, science, philosophy and the historic tragedies of the 20th century. Five of them won Tony Awards for best play: \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" in 1968; \"Travesties\" in 1976; \"The Real Thing\" in 1984; \"The Coast of Utopia\" in 2007; and \"Leopoldstadt\" in 2023.",
      "He wrote plays for radio and television including \"A Walk on the Water,\" televised in 1963, and made his stage breakthrough with \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\" which reimagined Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" from the viewpoint of two hapless minor characters.",
      "Stoppard was a strong champion of free speech who worked with organizations including PEN\u00a0and Index on Censorship. He claimed not to have strong political views otherwise, writing in 1968: \"I burn with no causes. I cannot say that I write with any social objective. One writes because one loves writing, really.\"",
      "That was especially true of his late play \"Leopoldstadt,\" which drew on his own family's story for the tale of a Jewish Viennese family over the first half of the 20th century. Stoppard said he began thinking of his personal link to the Holocaust quite late in life, only discovering after his mother's death in 1996 that many members of his family, including all four grandparents, had died in concentration camps.",
      "\"Leopoldstadt\" premiered in London at the start of 2020 to rave reviews; weeks later all theaters were shut by the COVID-19 pandemic. It eventually opened on Broadway in late 2022, going on to win four Tonys.",
      "Dizzyingly prolific, Stoppard also wrote many radio plays, a novel, television series including \"Parade's End\" (2013) and many film screenplays. These included dystopian Terry Gilliam comedy \"Brazil\" (1985), Steven Spielberg-directed war drama \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987), Elizabethan romcom \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998) \u2014 for which he and Marc Norman shared a best adapted screenplay Oscar \u2014 code breaking thriller \"Enigma\" (2001) and Russian epic \"Anna Karenina\" (2012).",
      "He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for his services to literature.",

      "Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, a critic of COVID-19 vaccines, has been named second-in-command at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "While there has not been an official announcement about Abraham's role, a CDC spokesperson confirmed with CBS News Atlanta that he was listed in the Atlanta-based agency's address book as principal deputy director. A Health and Human Services spokesperson has also confirmed his appointment.",
      "Abraham, a 70-year-old former Republican congressman and doctor from rural northeast Louisiana, served three terms in the House of Representatives before losing his bid for governor in 2019. He was appointed surgeon general in December 2023.",
      "In February, Abraham ordered his staff to stop engaging in media campaigns and community health fairs to encourage vaccinations, saying in a memo that the Louisiana Department of Health \"will no longer promote mass vaccination.\" The announcement was made the same day that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in to serve as President Trump's health secretary.",
      "In a letter posted on the Louisiana Department of Health's website, Abraham decried \"blanket government mandates\" for vaccines and criticized the CDC's COVID-19 vaccination push, saying individuals should make their own decisions about vaccinations.",
      "\"Government should admit the limitations of its role in people's lives and pull back its tentacles from the practice of medicine,\" Abraham argued.",

      "\"Dr. Abraham has been on the wrong side of several important public health issues over the past decade,\" Shah wrote. \"His track record, which includes undermining confidence in vaccines and minimizing the risk of outbreaks, disqualifies him from steering an agency charged with protecting all Americans.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:52:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration tapped a Biden-era rule to negotiate lower prices on 15 widely used medications for seniors.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has negotiated lower prices for 15 widely used medications covered by Medicare, with the federal government saying the effort will cut spending on those drugs by 44%, or about $12 billion. So will the initiative help save money for seniors?",
      "That's less clear, given that Medicare enrollees are already protected by a cap on drug costs. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u00a0said Monday the new prices will save the 55 million people enrolled in the Part D pharmaceutical plan a total of about $685 million.",
      "Individuals' out-of-pocket reductions are likely to vary based on whether they use one or more of the drugs covered under the new agreement and if they've reached their annual spending cap. On average, however, with 5.3 million people using the newly discounted drugs, that equates to savings of roughly $129 per Medicare enrollee.",
      "CMS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the projected individual savings under the new Medicare pricing plan.",
      "The lower drug prices were arranged through the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a measure to negotiate prices for some of Medicare's most expensive drugs. Before the 2022 law, Medicare was prohibited from negotiating with pharmaceutical firms to secure more favorable drug prices for participants in the government health program.",
      "Under the new agreement, lower prices for the 15 drugs will take effect in 2027 for medications bought through Medicare's Part D prescription plan, CMS\u00a0said. The discounts will range from 38% to 85% off the medications' list prices, according to the agency.",
      "The best-known drugs covered by the agreement include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy, popular medications used for diabetes treatment and weight loss, while other drugs on the list are used to treat common diseases such as asthma and prostate cancer.",
      "The cost of prescription drugs ranks among the top concerns of seniors, according to AARP.",
      "Starting in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act also introduced a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap for seniors. Because that spending limit is adjusted annually for inflation, it could reach about $2,200 in 2027 based on current trends. Medicare enrollees pay nothing for covered prescriptions above that amount. In other words, the negotiated prices for the 15 drugs could help seniors lower their costs until they hit that threshold.",
      "About 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used the 15 drugs to treat diseases such as diabetes and asthma, CMS said. The medications account for $40.7 billion in spending in Medicare Part D.",
      "Aside from savings that individuals might see on their prescriptions, the lower drug pricing will benefit Medicare itself, Merith Basey, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group for lowering prescription costs, told CBS News.",
      "\"Medicare is using its bargaining power to lower prices on the most expensive drugs covered by the program,\" Basey said. \"The savings gained from the new, lower negotiated prices are what allow the program to pay for the out-of-pocket cap.\"",
      "The program's ability to negotiate drug costs also represents \"the most powerful tool we currently have in place to rein in drug prices and hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable,\" she added.",
      "Medicare's negotiations are separate from deals negotiated by President Trump to lower prices for Zepbound, Ozempic and Wegovy, announced earlier this month. Under that agreement \u2014 which covers eligible patients on Medicare, Medicaid and the planned TrumpRX pharmaceutical website \u2014 the monthly cost of the GLP-1 drugs will range from $245 to $350, down from\u00a0as high as $1,350 per month.",
      "However, the price for Medicare enrollees for Wegovy and Ozempic under the earlier deal will be $245, less than the $274 negotiated by CMS. In Monday's announcement, CMS didn't specify how the two programs might work together.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, CMS said the earlier deal's pricing is \"expected to supersede\" the prices stipulated under IRA.",

      "U.S. air travelers who haven't upgraded to a Real ID can still fly without one, but starting Feb. 1 they'll be charged a $45 fee, the Transportation Security Administration\u00a0said\u00a0Monday.",
      "Fliers without a Real ID, a passport or another acceptable form of ID will need to have their identities confirmed through a fee-based verification system called TSA Confirm.ID, the agency said.",
      "The announcement of a $45 fee for people without Real IDs comes after the TSA started requiring the identification or other approved documents in May. The Real ID is a federally compliant state driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card, identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "Passengers without Real IDs \"will be referred to the optional TSA Confirm.ID process for identity verification upon TSA check-in and prior to entering the security line,\" the TSA said.",
      "The process will vary from airport to airport, according to the agency, which said it is working with private vendors to allow consumers to pay for the screening process before they arrive at the airport. The TSA warned that people without Real IDs could encounter increased wait times at airports while their identities are verified.",
      "The fee verifies passengers for a 10-day period, according to the TSA. The agency is still urging passengers without Real IDs to visit their local DMV to update their IDs.",
      "The $45 fee is designed to ensure that travelers, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the advanced verification system, said Adam Stahl, a TSA official, in the statement.",
      "How does Confirm.ID work?",
      "Confirm.ID asks passengers without Real IDs to answer a series of questions about themselves to verify their identity.",
      "Once a passenger's identity is confirmed, they'll receive a receipt to show a screening agent at the TSA checkpoint, along with their form of ID. They will then continue through security like all other passengers.",
      "Passengers who don't have Real IDs and opt not to pay the $45 fee may be denied entry at checkpoints, the TSA said Monday during a press call describing the new fee-based program.",

    "story": [
      "Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts.",
      "Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier,\u00a0according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago.",
      "The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market.",
      "Inflation remains a problem",
      "Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said.",
      "\"A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth.\"",
      "He added, \"This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did.\"",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April.",
      "Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few \"big ticket\" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck.",
      "Affordability pinch",
      "Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers.",
      "Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays.",
      "Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Spending among the bottom 80% of households \u2014 or those earning less than $175,000 a year \u2014 has \"simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic,\" Zandi wrote in a September social media post.",
      "That's creating a so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs.",
      "It's not yet clear from Black Friday and Cyber Monday spending whether the K-shaped trend influenced this year's record holiday sales, but both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted.",
      "\"So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well,\" he said. \"Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too.\"",

      "Experts who spoke to CBS News said global economic developments are weighing on the crypto sector. Bitcoin prices sank after a Bank of Japan official hinted at a possible interest rate hike at its upcoming meeting on Dec. 18-19. Higher interest rates tend to stoke market demand for safer assets, while putting pressure on riskier investments, including crypto.",
      "\"$BTC dumped [because] BOJ put Dec rate hike in play,\" Arthur Hayes, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, wrote on X early Monday.",
      "The selloff is also part of a broader decrease in risk appetite that is reverberating across other tech stocks, according to Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory group deVere Group. He noted that bitcoin's performance has mirrored that of the Nasdaq Composite, where a 4% pullback in tech has translated into a near 30% drop in the value of bitcoin.",

    "summary": "A long-lost painting by 17th-century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens sold at auction for well beyond its asking price.",
    "story": [
      "A long-lost painting by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens, which was hidden for more than four centuries, sold for $2.7 million at an auction Sunday in Versailles.",
      "The painting was recently found in a private townhouse in Paris. It depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.",
      "It was part of a French collection and was initially thought to be from one of the many Rubens workshops that existed at the time. The artwork was rarely valued at more than $11,500.",
      "\"I immediately had a hunch about this painting, and I did everything I could to try to have it authenticated,\" auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told The Associated Press. \"And finally, we managed to have it authenticated by the Rubenianum, which is the Rubens committee in Antwerp.\"",
      "Osenat told AFP earlier this year the picture was \"a masterpiece\" which was painted by Rubens when he was \"at the height of his talent.\"",
      "The painting was authenticated by German art historian Nils Buttner, known for his research on the master of the Flemish Baroque, Osenat said. Its provenance was certified through methods including X-ray imaging and pigment analysis, he added.",
      "B\u00fcttner explained before the auction that the master often painted crucifixions but rarely depicted \"the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross.\"",
      "\"So this is the one and only painting showing blood and water coming out of the side wound of Christ, and this is something that Rubens only painted once.\"",
      "The Osenat auction house said the painting's authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments Rubens typically used in painting human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",
      "Although Rubens produced many works for the Church, the painting, measuring 42 by 29 inches, was likely to have been created for a private collector.",
      "A flurry of paintings by famous artists have sold at auctions in recent days.",
      "Last week, a previously unknown work by French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir of his toddler son Jean sold for $2.08 million at a Paris auction.",
      "Also in November, a self-portrait by celebrated Mexican artist Frida Kahlo\u00a0sold for $54.66 million\u00a0in New York, a record for a painting by a woman. Two nights before that, a Gustav Klimt canvas\u00a0fetched $236.4 million\u00a0\u2014 a record for a modern art piece.",

      "Airlines reported short-term disruptions heading into the busy\u00a0Thanksgiving holiday weekend\u00a0as they fixed software on a widely used commercial aircraft.",
      "Thousands of Airbus A320 airliners around the world might require a software update, potentially causing flight delays or cancellations during the busy Thanksgiving holiday weekend.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote on social media Saturday afternoon that \"travelers SHOULD NOT expect any major disruptions.\"",
      "\"All impacted U.S. carriers have reported great progress, and are on track to meet the deadline of this Sunday at midnight to complete the work,\" Duffy said.",
      "The emergency update stems from an incident Oct. 30 when a JetBlue flight traveling from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced an issue with its flight controls. The plane dropped about 100 feet in seven seconds, according to preliminary flight data from Flightradar24, and was diverted to Tampa, Florida.",
      "Between 15 and 20 people were injured and taken to area hospitals upon\u00a0landing, according to Vivian Shedd, a spokesperson for Tampa Fire Rescue.",
      "Airbus identified an apparent issue relating to \"intense solar radiation,\" which \"may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls\" and recommended an emergency software update to the A320 family of aircraft \u2013 a common passenger plane for U.S. carriers.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency issued emergency orders Friday that grounded the affected planes. The EU safety agency's order took effect Saturday at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, meaning planes awaiting the updates would be essentially grounded. The order allows for the planes to be flown up to three times without passengers to get them to a location for the fix.",
      "The software change comes as U.S. passengers were beginning to head home from the Thanksgiving holiday, which is the busiest travel time in the country. More than 500 U.S.-registered aircraft will be impacted, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Several U.S. carriers use the Airbus A320 family in their fleet. Spirit and Frontier only fly the A320 family of planes, with many popular carriers maintaining several hundred in their fleet. Delta flies about 315 A320 jets, United has about 200 planes and American has around 480 planes.",
      "United told CBS News the order impacts six aircraft in its Airbus fleet. Delta expects only a small portion of its A320 fleet, less than 50 aircraft, to be impacted by the updates.",
      "American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News Friday evening that it had downgraded the number of impacted aircraft from more than 340 to 209, and that it expected the majority of those 209 to be updated by Friday \"and through the night.\"",
      "\"All aircraft will be completed ahead of the EASA Emergency Airworthiness Directive taking effect tomorrow at 6 p.m. CT,\" American said in a statement.",
      "Hawaii Airlines said it was unaffected.",
      "Internationally, Japan's All Nippon Airways canceled 65 domestic flights on Saturday and said further cancellations were possible. Air India said on X that it had completed the reset on more than 40% of the planes that needed it, and that there were no cancellations so far. France's transport minister said the issue had a limited impact in the country. Disruptions were also minimal in the U.K., Germany and Scandinavia.",
      "Airlines for America, the trade association for the leading U.S. airlines, predicted that carriers will fly a record 31 million passengers from last Friday, Nov. 21, through this coming Monday. The FAA says it expects this year's Thanksgiving holiday travel period to be the busiest in 15 years.",
      "Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologized to customers in a post on LinkedIn.",
      "\"Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations, with the safety assurance you expect from Airbus,\" he wrote in a message posted on Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, Airbus also informed airlines globally Saturday that is implementing new procedures that will restrict Airbus aircraft equipped with Pratt & Whitney engines in certain freezing winter weather conditions that include freezing fog and visibility less than 450 feet.",
      "Pratt & Whitney engines are found on the Airbus A220 and are an engine option for the A320 family of planes.",

    "summary": "Shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday despite wider economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year's holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday \u2014 spending billions of dollars both in stores and online.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce, said U.S. consumers spent a record $11.8 billion online Friday, marking a 9.1% jump from last year. It was a slight increase from the company's spending estimate of $11.7 billion.",
      "Traffic particularly piled up between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time nationwide, when $12.5 million passed through online shopping carts every minute. Mobile shopping was estimated to drive more than half of all sales, according to Adobe.",
      "Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. Top categories that saw an uptick in sales across both days included video game consoles, electronics and home appliances. Shopping services powered by artificial intelligence and social media advertising have also particularly influenced what consumers choose to buy, the firm said.",
      "In-store traffic continues to dwindle",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $18 billion in the U.S. and $79 billion globally. And e-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $6.2 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $5.1 million per minute - with top categories including cosmetics and clothing, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Black Friday is far from the sales event that created midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem just decades ago. More and more consumers have instead turned to online deals to make post-Thanksgiving purchases from the comfort of their own homes - or opt to stretch out spending across longer promotions now offered by retailers.",
      "As a result, in-store traffic has continued to dwindle. Initial data from RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in physical stores, found that U.S. Black Friday traffic fell 3.6% from 2024.",
      "But \"the story isn't just that shoppers stayed home; it's that they're changing how and when they shop,\" Joe Shasteen, global manager of advanced analytics at RetailNext said in emailed comments on Saturday. He explained that customers are now spreading out purchases over a longer time frame and \"walking into stores with a far narrower mission than we've seen in past holiday seasons.\"",
      "Black Friday remains a major date on retailers' calendar - and Shasteen added that Friday's drop is \"notably better\" than a sharper 6.2% decline RetailNext saw in in-store traffic for the days leading up to Thanksgiving. This indicates that, while shoppers remain cautious and are pulling back on in-store spending overall, \"they're still willing to show up for the biggest promotional moments,\" he said.",
      "Experts expect heightened holiday spending to continue through the weekend. In terms of e-commerce, Adobe expects U.S. shoppers to spend another $5.5 billion Saturday and $5.9 billion on Sunday - before reaching an estimated $14.2 billion peak on Cyber Monday, which would mark yet another record.",
      "Tariffs create strain on businesses and households",
      "Still, rising prices could be contributing to some of those numbers. U.S. President Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs\u00a0on foreign imports have strained businesses and households alike over the last year. The federal government had raised $195 billion in customs duties for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "Despite spending more overall, Salesforce found U.S. shoppers purchased fewer items at checkout on Black Friday (down 2% from last year). Order volumes also slipped 1%, the firm noted, as average selling prices climbed 7%.",
      "This year's holiday spending rush arrives amid heightened economic uncertainty for consumers. Beyond tariffs, workers across public and private sectors are also struggling with anxieties over job security - amid both corporate layoffs and the after-effects of the 43-day government shutdown.",
      "For the November-December holiday season overall, the National Retail Federation estimates U.S. shoppers will spend more than $1 trillion for the first time this year. But the rate of growth is slowing - with an anticipated increase of 3.7% to 4.2% year over year, compared to 4.3% in 2024's holiday season.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies on other short-term loans have been rising. And more and more shoppers are turning to \"buy now, pay later\" plans, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",
      "Americans spending more for the holidays despite dour economic views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShopping on Black Friday?

    "story": [
      "Stocks gained in a short Friday session to close near a record high, capping a five-day rally that helped the S&P 500 index erase nearly all its losses from earlier in the month.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 36 points, or 0.5%, to close at 6,849, 42 points shy of its Oct. 28 record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 289 points, or 0.6%, to close at 47,716. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7% on Friday but ended November with a decline of 1.5% because of losses for some big tech stocks.",
      "Stock indexes closed at 1 p.m. EDT on Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "The multi-day rebound came after a largely volatile month for stocks, sparked by concerns about a possible bubble in artificial intelligence and tech stocks. AI chipmaker Nvidia lost 1.8% Friday and closed the month with a double-digit loss. Oracle tumbled 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%.",
      "\"The market needs to prove it can sustain this momentum, but right now, the weakness after Nvidia's earnings looks like it could be more of a short-term AI-selling climax than a sign of heightened bearishness,\" Chris Larkin, Managing Director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, said in an email.",
      "Some investors have expressed worry that an AI bubble\u00a0could burst, triggering devastating financial losses. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals.",
      "Some tech stocks did notch monthly gains, most notably Alphabet, which rose nearly 14%, due to excitement about its recently released Gemini AI model.",
      "The market turned around on hopes that the Federal Reserve would again cut interest rates at its meeting next month. Recent comments from Fed officials have given traders more confidence that the central bank will again cut interest rates at its meeting that ends Dec. 10.",
      "Traders are betting on a nearly 87% probability that the Fed will cut next month, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The central bank, which has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market, is facing an increasingly difficult decision on interest rates as inflation rises and the job market slows. Cutting interest rates further could help support the economy as employment weakens, but it could also fuel inflation. The latest round of corporate earnings reports was mostly positive, but economic data has been mixed.",
      "The minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting in October indicate there are likely to be strong divisions among policymakers about the Fed's next step.",
      "Investors also had their eye on retail stocks as they wait to see if shoppers rushed to take advantage of the annual Black Friday sales event. Macy's fell 0.3% while Kohl's gained 1.4%. Dick's Sporting Goods dropped 0.5%. Among specialty retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch rose 2.9% and American Eagle Outfitters gained 0.7%.",
      "Amid the volatility in tech stocks, traders moved money into other parts of the market. Pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Merck each rose more than 20% for the month. Travel-related companies such as Marriott and Expedia also posted strong monthly gains.",
      "Earlier, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were halted for hours due to a technical issue at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME said the problem was tied to an outage at a CyrusOne data center.",
      "Treasury yields rose slightly, with the 10-year yield at 4.02%.",

      "Black Friday\u00a0is expected to be one of the biggest shopping days of the year, with Americans forecast to spend $11.7 billion online, according to Adobe Analytics. Mobile shopping will drive more than half of all sales, Adobe estimates.",
      "As millions of Americans search apps and websites for deals, experts warn that consumers should be on the lookout for fraudsters who will try to capitalize on the holiday shopping rush.",
      "\"Limited time only, gotta do it now, before it sells out, whatever it is. That whole sense of urgency is something bad guys love,\" Lisa Plaggemier, executive director of the National Cybersecurity Alliance,\u00a0told CBS News Texas.",
      "Fake QR codes, phony social media posts and phishing emails are just some of the tools scammers use to lure consumers into unwittingly forking over their information.",
      "To pull off their schemes, fraudsters are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence. One common scam is creating \"deepfakes\" \u2014 videos that appear to be a celebrity or influencer promoting a product but are in fact a dupe \u2014 to bait people into visiting counterfeit websites. That means that what you see may not be what you get.",
      "Once there, fraudsters can steal both your payment information and your personal credentials.",
      "\"You can't rely on your eyes and ears anymore,\" Plaggemier said.",
      "Scammers are also creating social media ads that mimic popular brands to fool customers into thinking whatever they are buying is the real deal, according to LifeLock, an identity theft protection service.",
      "Here are some tips to avoid scams if you're planning to make online purchases on Black Friday.",
      "Check the URL to make sure it's from a reputable retailer. Scammers often create fake websites that mirror other businesses' URLs. The fake ones, however, will contain misspellings or extra numbers and letters. For example, a fraudster might use the lookalike URL be5tbuy.com to mimic bestbuy.com, according to LifeLock. If something seems amiss, take a moment to reconsider your purchase.\u00a0Use a credit card.\u00a0Experts say using a credit card can better protect against fraud. With debit cards, the onus falls on you to get your money back, according to NerdWallet, a personal finance website. With credit cards, it's up to the card issuer to get the money back, meaning the consumer faces less legwork and an easier path to getting a refund. Whatever card you use, experts encourage shoppers to track their purchase history to make sure nothing is amiss.\u00a0Be skeptical of offers or discounts that seem too good to be true. Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights at Salesforce, told CBS News in an email that shoppers should verify offers directly on the retailer's web page.Read the fine print.\u00a0While it may be easy to skim over purchase details, experts encourage shoppers to give them some extra attention. Melanie McGovern, the director of public relations and social media at the nonprofit Better Business Bureau, told CBS News Texas that shoppers should check shipping dates, return policies and \u00a0restocking dates for sold-out items. \"Just doing general things before you make that purchase will help you to make sure you get the item before the holidays,\" she told CBS News Texas.Use the Better Business Bureau's Scam Tracker.\u00a0The tool lets you report scams and read those documented by other consumers, helping you avoid falling for the same tactics.Be wary of links from unsolicited emails and text messages.\u00a0Scammers often send messages that appear to come from a legitimate company, urging you to take an action such as updating your payment information. LifeLock advises consumers to check the sender's email address to confirm it matches the organization it claims to be. Shoppers should also watch for spelling or branding mistakes, a common sign of a scam.",

    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

Lead poisoning can lead to symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, memory loss, and pain or tingling in your hands or feet, among other issues, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Children are especially sensitive to lead, which can damage their brains and nervous systems, slowing their growth and development, the agency says. Women of childbearing age and new mothers who are breastfeeding their infants are also at risk for lead poisoning, the FDA notes.",

      "Below are the cookware products the FDA says should be discarded, along with the manufacturer or distributor when that is specified. The items were sold by a handful of retailers in states including California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and New York, as well as Washington, D.C.

    "story": [
      "Discounts and deals abound around Thanksgiving, but other days may offer better prices for holiday shopping, according to retail experts.",
      "This year may be a mixed bag for discounts, as some business owners have told CBS News that rising costs are giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales. Still, holiday spending this year could top $1 trillion for the first time, according to a forecast from the National Retail Federation, which expects roughly 187 million people to shop between Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year.",
      "So far in 2025, consumer spending has been driven by high-earning households, while low- and middle-income families are feeling pinched by inflation and affordability pressures, economic research shows.",
      "Here's when to expect the best Black Friday weekend deals, broken down by product category.",
      "Shop in-store for big appliances",
      "Looking to buy a big appliance, like a refrigerator, washing machine, or kitchen appliance? It's best to shop in person at brick-and-mortar stores on Black Friday, according to Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, a provider of retail research.",
      "\"We expect to see lots of promotions that are unique to in-store purchases at retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Shoppers should also head to retailers early, because inventory could be limited. Additionally, she expects retailers to adjust pricing in real time, based on consumer demand. Promotions could even vary on a store-by-store basis, depending on inventory levels, Weinswig noted.",
      "When to find travel deals",
      "While the Tuesday after Thanksgiving has been dubbed \"Travel Tuesday,\" it's not necessarily the cheapest time to book. Instead, consumers should start looking for deals as early as Thursday evening, said Julian Kheel, founder of Points Path, a flight search engine.",
      "The best way to keep on top of such promotions is to sign up for your favorite airline or hotel's email alerts, Kheel said. You can always unsubscribe after you've made a reservation, he notes.",
      "\"Most companies will try to get ahead of the competition by launching sales by the morning of Black Friday at the latest,\" he said. \"So don't wait until late Tuesday to look for a great travel deal.\"",
      "Deals on consumer electronics",
      "Cyber Monday is expected to be the best day to find deals on consumer electronics like TVs, speakers, computers and more, according to Adobe Digital Insights analyst Vivek Panyda.",
      "\"We'll see discounts in the range of 10% to 28%,\" he told CBS News.",
      "When to buy toys",
      "Black Friday will provide the lowest prices for popular kids' toys, according to retail analysts. It won't pay to wait later than that for deals, especially on hot items like Legos and Labubu dolls that tend to fly off shelves quickly, according to Pandya.",
      "Marshal Cohen, retail advisor at Circana, also advised that consumers should look beyond advertised prices and comparison shop for additional savings.",
      "\"Retailers are competing with so much of the same product,\" he said. \"So don't just rely on the ad you get. Take time to comparison shop and make sure it's really going to be the best price.\"",

      "Butler said his company has had to pass along some costs to consumers. He estimated that 85% of Americans still choose artificial Christmas trees over real ones, and said he's actively lobbying lawmakers to push for tariff relief. He says the price of an approximately $100 artificial tree has risen about $10 to $15 due to tariffs.",
      "\"We want to be treated the same as bananas, coffee, mangoes, etc.,\" Butler said, in reference to an executive order signed by Mr. Trump earlier this month that exempts products including beef, coffee, tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados, cocoa and certain spices from the new tariffs. \"Those things are not grown in the U.S. We know that those are now being exempted. Our raw materials are not available in the U.S. And so we think we should be treated in the same way.\"",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can do the work currently performed by nearly 12% of America's workforce, according to a recent\u00a0study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The researchers, relying on a metric called the \"Iceberg Index\" that measures a job's potential to be automated, conclude that AI already has the cognitive and technical capacity to handle a range of tasks in technology, finance, health care and professional services.",
      "The index simulated how more than 150 million U.S. workers across nearly 1,000 occupations interact and overlap with AI's abilities. Specifically, it measures exposure to AI capabilities and how the rapidly emerging technology overlaps with workers' occupational skills.",
      "The study doesn't seek to shed light on how many workers AI may already have displaced or could supplant in the future. To what extent such tools take over job functions performed by people depends on a number of factors, including individual businesses' strategy, societal acceptance and possible policy interventions, the researchers note.",

      "For example, AI can streamline filling out paperwork, freeing nurses up to spend more time with patients. It can also quickly and accurately produce software code, forcing software engineers with limited skills to shift their focus.",
      "In addition, \"[F]inancial analysts will not disappear, but AI systems may demonstrate capability across significant portions of document-processing and routine analysis work,\" the researchers said. \"This reshapes how roles are structured and which skills remain in demand, without necessarily reducing headcount.\"",

    "story": [
      "Soccer fans traveling to the U.S. to watch the 2026\u00a0World Cup\u00a0being held in North America will drive tourism spending in 11 host cities and provide a substantial boost to local economies, according to Tourism Economics, a provider of global travel data.",
      "The global soccer tournament, held every four years, is expected to draw 1.2 million international visitors, including spectators and their non-ticketed travel companions, national team representatives, match officials, and others, according to Tourism Economics.",
      "The tournament kicks off on June 12 in Los Angeles. Seventy-eight matches will be played across 11 U.S. cities, with an additional 26 games set to take place in Mexico and Canada. The finals will be held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on July 19.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:49:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Past-due balances are becoming a reality for many U.S. households as they struggle to keep up with costlier utility bills.",
    "story": [
      "Americans' energy bills are piling up, forcing them deeper into debt and even triggering power shutoffs.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 households went into collections or fell in arrears on their utility bills, according to a new\u00a0joint report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The problem was even more pronounced in parts of the South and Appalachia, where one in 12 households was already in collections or on the verge of it.",
      "In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.",
      "More Americans are falling behind on their utility payments due to\u00a0rising energy prices, alongside a jump in costs for other essentials, ranging from child care to housing.",
      "\"When we see families unable to pay their utility bills, it raises alarm bells about a crisis of home heating and electricity, but it also raises alarm bells about people's ability to deal with their cost of living across the board,\" said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation.",
      "Residential electricity prices rose by 10.5% between January and August 2025, one of the fastest increases in a decade, government data analyzed by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), an educational and policy organization, shows. Natural gas is still the most popular way Americans heat their homes, although a growing\u00a0share are using electricity.",
      "A combination of high interest rates, rising natural gas costs and an increase in demand from data centers has pushed up prices, according to NEADA.",
      "The issue will likely come into sharper focus this winter when millions of consumers face heating bills. NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.",
      "More Americans at risk of shutoffs",
      "When people fail to pay their energy bills on time, it can lead to electricity shutoffs, or when a utility turns off a household's power until people pay the balance, along with a so-called reconnection fee.",
      "Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all. States without cold-weather protection include Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, according to the Energy Justice Lab, a joint project of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Despite these protections, Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable to shutoffs, experts told CBS News.",
      "While no official national count of utility cutoffs exists, NEADA estimates that 3.5 million American households had their power cut off at some point in 2024 based on public data reported by utility companies. That number is expected to swell to 4 million this year, NEADA estimates.",
      "\"Past due balances climbing, particularly for lower-income families, suggest that shutoffs are going to become much more prevalent,\" the Century Foundation's Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Con Edison, a utility serving New York City and Westchester County in New York, has cut off almost 168,000 customers at some point this year, according to data NEADA shared with CBS News. That's more than five times the number of shutoffs the utility reported last year.",
      "Most Americans whose power is cut off have services restored within a few days, according to Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director. Still, the shutoffs can create major disruptions to Americans' day-to-day lives as they lose refrigeration, internet and lighting. Pipes can also freeze, and residents could get sick if their apartments get too cold, Wolfe added.",
      "Shutoffs tend to have a bigger impact on low-income households, given they are already stretched thin by everyday expenses, Wolfe said. Many turn to payday lenders, friends and family or state forgiveness plans to cover reconnection costs or overdue bills, he added.",
      "\"When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,\" Wolfe told CBS News. \"That flexibility gives them a small sense of control, but it also increases the risk of falling behind and facing shutoffs.\"",

    "summary": "Criminals are targeting shoppers with fake websites, bogus charities and other fraudulent pitches, according to insights from Visa.",
    "story": [
      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

    "story": [
      "Some batteries that power a popular brand of e-bike pose a fire hazard that can cause serious injury or death and shouldn't be used, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said in a\u00a0notice Monday.",
      "The commission is warning customers to immediately stop using lithium-ion batteries that power e-bikes made by Seattle, Washington-based Rad Power Bikes. The batteries can ignite and explode, causing serious injury or death, the agency warned.",
      "Rad Power Bikes said it disagreed with the agency's warning.",
      "\"Rad Power Bikes firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC's characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe,\" a Rad spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The batteries that pose a fire hazard are model numbers are RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304, according to the CPSC. They are particularly vulnerable to catching fire when they are exposed to water and also to what the commission describes as \"debris.\"",
      "CPSC said it has received 31 reports of the batteries causing fires, including 12 reports of fires that caused property damage. Cumulatively, accidents related to the batteries have caused roughly $734,500 in property damage, it said, adding that some of the incidents took place when a battery was neither charging nor in use.",
      "CPSC is urging consumers to immediately stop using the batteries, which it said should be removed from the e-bikes and disposed of in accordance with local disposal procedures. It added that Rad Power Bikes has not agreed to recall the products.",
      "Rad Power Bikes added that its bikes are equipped with batteries that it says \"meet or exceed rigorous international safety standards.\"",
      "Rad said it tested its batteries at independent third-party labs, which confirmed that the batteries met the industry's highest standards.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:19:16 -0500",
    "summary": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the commander of a September operation \"worked well within his authority and the law\" when ordering a follow-on strike.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House on Monday said that a U.S. attack on an alleged drug boat in September included more than one strike on the vessel, seemingly confirming a Washington Post report that the U.S. targeted the boat for a second time to take out survivors of the initial attack.",
      "The Post reported on Friday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors before the U.S. attack on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the first strike left two men alive in the water. The paper said the commander of the operation, Adm. Frank Bradley, ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the two. CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",
      "The report sparked calls for an investigation by lawmakers of both parties in Congress, some of whom raised the prospect that targeting the survivors could constitute a war crime. Hegseth has called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" claiming the operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the Post's report during the White House briefing on Monday. \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\" a reporter asked.",
      "\"The latter is true,\" Leavitt replied, before reading out a written statement. \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "President Trump said Sunday that he \"wouldn't have wanted\" the second strike but defended Hegseth's handling of the incident, saying the secretary told him he did not order the subsequent attack.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One, saying he has \"great confidence\" in Hegseth.",
      "He added: \"I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "A group of former military lawyers argued in an assessment on Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. In Congress, the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees pledged to investigate the matter. And Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that the strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" while GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio agreed that it \"would be an illegal act\" if true.",
      "The developments come as the U.S. has carried out close to two dozen boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean since the first attack on Sept. 2.",
      "Asked by CBS News if he has concerns about the boat strikes more broadly, Mr. Trump said Sunday: \"Very little, because you can see the boats, you can see the drugs in the boats and each boat is responsible for killing 25,000 Americans.\"",
      "\"The amount of drugs coming into our country by sea is infinitesimal compared to what it was just a few months ago,\" the president said.",

      "The president said Sunday that the MRI conducted in October wasn't for his brain and the results were \"perfect,\" although he didn't know what they covered.",
      "\"No idea, it was just an MRI,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday when asked about what part of the body the test covered. \"What part of the body? It wasn't the brain, because I took a cognitive test and I aced it.\"",
      "He also said Sunday he would release the results from his MRI.",
      "\"As part of President Donald Jr. Trump's comprehensive executive physical, advanced imaging was performed because men in his age group benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health,\" reads a letter dated Dec. 1 from Sean Barbabella, physician to the president. \"The purpose of this imaging is preventative: to identify issues early, confirm overall health, and ensure he maintains long-term vitality and function.\"",
      "Barbabella said the president's cardiovascular imaging \"is perfectly normal,\" and his abdominal imaging \"is also perfectly normal.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read Barbabella's letter to reporters in Monday's press briefing.",

      "FBI Director Kash Patel's travel to watch his girlfriend sing at a Pennsylvania sporting event is now being investigated by the top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "Citing a series of recent media reports, the committee Democrats allege Patel has used the FBI's Gulfstream passenger jet for a series of recent flights for a \"date night\" in Tennessee and an outing with friends in Texas.",
      "The panel's Democrats have asked Patel to respond with travel records, passenger information and any communication with passengers about the recent flights.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who is the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, and another committee member, Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California, wrote to the FBI to ask about Patel's Oct. 25 flight to Pennsylvania.",
      "\"You flew there because your girlfriend was performing at a wrestling match on the campus of Pennsylvania State University,\" the Democrats wrote in the letter. \"After attending her performance, you used the government's jet to fly with her home to Nashville the following day. Your 'date night' had no apparent connections to your official duties.\"",
      "The inquiry also questioned a trip to Texas that was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "\"Later that weekend, you took the FBI jet to San Angelo, Texas, for four days, where Republican Party mega-donor Bubba Saulsbury hosted you at Boondoggle Ranch\u2014'a scenic hunting resort' that touts itself as the ideal place to 'waste money or time on unnecessary or questionable projects,'\" Raskin and Kamlager-Dove wrote.",
      "The FBI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Judiciary Committee Democrats said Patel's travel on the flights was revealed by public flight logs and social media posts by Patel's girlfriend.",

Raskin and Kamlager-Dover wrote, \"These planes are not yours. They are the property of the U.S. Government and are paid for by the American people.\"",
      "In May, CBS News reported about questions surrounding Patel's use of the FBI aircraft, including a formal request by Senate Democrats for a Government Accountability Office review of Patel's travel.",
      "FBI directors are required by executive branch policy to use government aircraft for air travel, whether official or personal. That allows them to maintain access to secure communications wherever they travel and to move quickly in the event of an emergency. They must reimburse the government for personal flights at coach fare rates. Directors are permitted to take family or friends on personal trips, but the cost of their trips must be reimbursed to the government, as well.",
      "CBS News reporting in May found Patel also appears to have made use of the FBI's Gulfstream 5 jets to travel to Las Vegas, where he has a home, and to Nashville, where Patel's girlfriend, a country singer, lives. Sources familiar with Patel's travel confirmed to CBS News that the director was on the plane for several trips captured by public flight trackers, including a weekend jaunt to Las Vegas on March 7 and a weekend in Nashville on March 24.",

The U.S. attack on the vessel was announced by Mr. Trump on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the initial strike left two survivors in the water, and the commander of the operation then ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the survivors.",
      "A working group of former judge advocates general said that if this is true, it would constitute \"war crimes, murder, or both.\" The group pointed to the Geneva Conventions, which says that members of armed forces who are out of the fight because of \"sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely,\" and acts including \"violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds\" are banned. The U.S. military has killed at least 80 people in boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific in \"Operation Southern Spear,\" which it says is targeting narco-terrorists.",

      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a reported second strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year, while pledging to look into the incident.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine and if there were two people around,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One. \"But Pete said that didn't happen. I have great confidence in him.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump warned that Venezuelan airspace should be considered closed, and Venezuela said the U.S. had unilaterally suspended its migrant repatriation flights and wants to \"undermine the sovereignty of its airspace.\"",
      "The Trump administration says it's aiming to stop drugs from being smuggled into the U.S., while Venezuela says Mr. Trump seeks Maduro's ouster. Over the past several weeks, the U.S. has moved a number of military ships to the western Atlantic and the Caribbean and reopened a naval base in Puerto Rico.",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court decision that disqualified Alina Habba as acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court decision that disqualified Alina Habba, who served as a personal lawyer to President Trump, as the acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit was unanimous against the Trump administration, which has attempted to use a novel mechanism to place lawyers who have not received Senate approval into temporary U.S. attorney positions across the country.",
      "The case before the 3rd Circuit arose after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey challenged the validity of Habba's appointment as a violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and sought to have their indictments dismissed.",
      "U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled in August that Habba has been serving without lawful authority since the beginning of July, when she was tapped to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey. Brann said she must be disqualified from participating in ongoing cases.",
      "The Justice Department appealed that decision to the 3rd Circuit, which is now the first federal appeals court to weigh in on the administration's scheme for installing certain U.S. attorneys.",
      "\"The court's decision affirms that U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is unlawfully and invalidly serving as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey, marking the first time an appellate court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions,\" lawyers Abbe Lowell, Gerry Krovatin and Norm Eisen said in a joint statement. \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. attorneys wherever appropriate.\"",
      "Lowell argued before the 3rd Circuit, and Krovatin represents one of the defendants.",
      "Thomas Mirigliano, a lawyer who represented a second defendant, said \"the panel issued a clear and carefully reasoned decision that recognizes the extraordinary power vested in U.S. attorneys and reinforces the limits Congress has set on who may occupy those positions. We appreciate the Court's thoughtful approach and the clarity it brings to this important issue.\"",
      "Neither Habba nor the Justice Department immediately responded to requests for comment.",
      "Habba was tapped to serve as interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey earlier this year, but her appointment to the role was limited to 120 days, unless the U.S. district court in New Jersey voted to extend her tenure or she was confirmed to the post by the Senate. Habba's nomination, however, was unlikely to win approval in the upper chamber, as New Jersey's two senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed her nomination.",
      "Ahead of the 120-day deadline, the judges in New Jersey declined to allow Habba to continue serving as U.S. attorney and instead voted to install her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the position. But that decision was met with swift pushback from Attorney General Pam Bondi, who fired Grace.",
      "Then, Mr. Trump and top administration officials employed a multi-step maneuver to keep Habba in the role of U.S. attorney and get around the district court's decision. First, the president withdrew Habba's nomination for U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Then, Habba resigned as interim U.S. attorney. Bondi then appointed Habba as \"special attorney\" and to fill Grace's role as first assistant U.S. attorney. Finally, because the position as the New Jersey's top prosecutor was vacant, Habba was elevated to the role of acting U.S. attorney under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
      "That law, also known as the Vacancies Act, limits the government employees who can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.",
      "In their decision, the judges on the 3rd Circuit found that the Trump administration's argument in support of Habba's role \"should raise a red flag,\" since it would allow the Justice Department to circumvent the Vacancies Act and effectively allow anyone to hold a U.S. attorney position indefinitely.",
      "\"Under the Government's delegation theory, Habba may avoid the gauntlet of presidential appointment and Senate confirmation and serve as the de facto U.S. Attorney indefinitely,\" Judge Michael Fisher wrote for the court. \"This view is so broad that it bypasses the constitutional [presidential appointment and Senate confirmation] process entirely. It also essentially eliminates the requirements of the FVRA and the U.S. Attorney-specific statute.\"",
      "Fisher was selected for the 3rd Circuit by President George W. Bush. He was joined in the decision by Judge L. Felipe Restrepo, appointed by President Barack Obama, and Judge D. Brooks Smith, tapped for the 3rd Circuit by Bush.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to install temporary U.S. attorneys in Nevada and Los Angeles using the mechanism it employed for Habba, but has faced resistance from the courts. The most high-profile of those decisions came last week, when a federal judge ordered the criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured their indictments, was unlawfully appointed to the role.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Georgia judge on Wednesday agreed to dismiss the state's case against President Trump and his allies stemming from the 2020 presidential election after the local prosecutor who took over the case said he would no longer pursue the charges \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.\"",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee issued a brief order dismissing the case \"in its entirety\" shortly after Peter Skandalakis, who stepped in to replace Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis after she was disqualified from the case, filed a motion informing the court of his decision to abandon the prosecution of Mr. Trump and more than a dozen others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.",
      "Skandalakis wrote in a memo accompanying the notice that overt acts listed in the indictment that were taken by the president and other Republicans \"are not acts I would consider sufficient\" to sustain a racketeering case. Skandalakis said that after reviewing the evidence, he concluded that a federal prosecution was more appropriate than one pursued by the state of Georgia, and said the \"strongest and most prosecutable case\" against those who allegedly sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election was the one being pursued by former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The president was charged with four federal counts stemming from an alleged effort to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, but Smith dropped the case after Mr. Trump won a second term in the White House.",
      "Steve Sadow, Mr. Trump's lawyer in the Georgia case, said in response to Skandalakis' motion, \"The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over. This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called the prosecution an \"illegal, unconstitutional and unAmerican hoax.\"",
      "\"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed in the Great State of Georgia,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "A spokesperson for Giuliani cheered the decision.",
      "\"The decision to dismiss all criminal charges against Mayor Rudy Giuliani is long overdue and represents a complete repudiation of the demonstrably false claims that partisan actors used to justify his improper disbarment,\" Ted Goodman, Giuliani's spokesperson, said in a statement. \"The integrity of our justice system cannot be fully restored until Mayor Giuliani's law license is reinstated and the hundreds of other victims of the political weaponization against President Trump and his supporters receive the justice they deserve.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and 18 of his associates were indicted by a Fulton County grand jury in August 2023 under Georgia's racketeering law and were accused of coordinating a scheme to thwart certification of the 2020 election results in the state. The indictment capped an extraordinary and historic five months, across which the president was charged in four separate cases involving allegations of conduct that bookended his first term in office. Mr. Trump was the first former president to be charged with a crime.",
      "Two of those cases were brought by Smith and involved federal offenses, and a third was brought by the Manhattan District Attorney and stemmed from an alleged \"hush money\" payment to an adult film actress before the 2016 election. Smith ended his prosecutions of the president \u2014 one related to the 2020 election and the other involving his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after leaving office in January 2021 \u2014 after he won a second term.",
      "In the New York case, Mr. Trump was found guilty of 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records in June 2024 and has appealed the conviction.",
      "Mr. Trump was initially charged with 13 felony counts in Georgia, but several have been dismissed in the years since the indictment. He pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. Four of the president's 18 co-defendants accepted plea deals from prosecutors.",
      "The prosecution in Fulton County moved the slowest of the criminal cases involving the president, and proceedings were derailed for months by the bombshell revelation that Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as a special prosecutor to assist in the investigation into Mr. Trump and his allies.",
      "The two acknowledged the relationship but said it didn't begin until months after Wade was hired in November 2021.",
      "The trial court judge overseeing the case, Scott McAfee, held a multi-day hearing to examine whether Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because of her relationship with Wade and travels with him, during which both prosecutors testified.",
      "McAfee ultimately declined to disqualify Willis from the case but said Wade had to step aside, which he did. But Mr. Trump and a group of his co-defendants appealed the ruling.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals reversed McAfee's decision in December and said disqualification of Willis was the only remedy to restore public confidence in the integrity of the proceedings. The Georgia Supreme Court turned away Willis' appeal\u00a0in September, leaving the ruling mandating her removal from the case against Mr. Trump intact.",
      "The Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia, which of Skandalakis is the executive director, was tasked with finding a replacement to take over the case from Willis. He announced earlier this month that he would helm the prosecution himself after several others contacted declined to do so.",

    "summary": "Juan Orlando Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of Honduras.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday that he will be pardoning former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who in 2024 was convicted in New York for drug trafficking and weapons charges and sentenced to 45 years in prison.",
      "The president explained his decision on social media by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "The idea drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hernandez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hern\u00e1ndez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hern\u00e1ndez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "A lawyer for Hernandez, Renato C. Stabile, expressed gratitude for Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"A great injustice has been righted and we are so hopeful for the future partnership of the United States and Honduras,\" Stabile said. \"Thank you President Trump for making sure that justice was served. We look forward to President Hernandez's triumphant return to Honduras.\"",
      "A separate lawyer for Hernandez, Sabrina Shroff, declined comment.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "\"This is shocking,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia, said of the pardon on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"He was convicted in a federal court in the United States,\" said Kaine, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \"One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine, more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House.\"",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",
      "Shortly after Trump announced his intention to pardon the ex-president, Hern\u00e1ndez's wife Ana Garc\u00eda and their adult children gathered on the steps of their home in Tegucigalpa.",
      "Garc\u00eda thanked Trump, saying that Trump had corrected an injustice, maintaining that Hern\u00e1ndez's prosecution was a coordinated plot by drug traffickers and the \"radical left\" to seek revenge against the former president.",
      "Mr. Trump's post on Friday was part of a broader message by the U.S. president backing Tito Asfura for Honduras' presidency, with Mr. Trump saying the U.S. would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Trump posted that \"the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.\"",
      "Asfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He was mayor of Tegucigalpa and has pledged to solve Honduras' infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies.",
      "In addition to Asfura, there are two other likely contenders for Honduras' presidency: Rixi Moncada, who served as the finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president for the incumbent democratic socialist Libre party, and Salvador Nasralla, a former television personality who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party.",
      "Mr. Trump has framed Honduras' election as trial for democracy, suggesting in a separate Truth Social post that if Asfura loses, the country could go the way of Venezuela and fall under the influence of that country's leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to apply pressure on Maduro, who the Trump administration has accused of leading a drug cartel, ordering a series of strikes against boats suspected of carrying drugs, building up the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean with warships, including the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford.",
      "The U.S. president has not ruled out taking military action or covert action by the CIA against Venezuela, though he has also floated that he was open to speaking with Maduro.",
      "Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the U.S. administration and she has received visits from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, when she was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras' extradition treaty and military cooperation with the U.S.",
      "Under Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the U.S. and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Sunday that a reported U.S. follow-on strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.\"",
      "\"If that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DoD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The Washington Post reported Friday that in the U.S.' first strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors. A follow-on strike was ordered to comply with the instructions, killing two survivors in the water, the Post reported. Hegseth called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" claiming the operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law.\"",
      "CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",
      "Targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are wounded is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions, which also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\" A group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. And the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees pledged to investigate the reported follow-on strike.",
      "Asked about the reported follow-on strike while aboard Air Force One on Sunday, President Trump said, \"First of all, I don't know that that happened, and Pete [Hegseth] said he didn't even know what people were talking about.\"",
      "\"So, we'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that, a second strike,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The first strike was very lethal. It was fine. If there were two people around \u2014 but Pete [Hegseth] said that didn't happen. I have great confidence in him ... I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he didn't order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out close to two dozen boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean. Kaine outlined to CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that lawmakers have been seeking answers to a number of questions about the strikes, including seeking evidence that \"the folks on board were really narco traffickers,\" the question of why to strike rather than interdict, and the legal rationale for the strikes.",
      "\"We had to pry with a crowbar after weeks and weeks out of the administration, the supposed legal rationale for the strikes at international waters,\" Kaine said. \"It was very shoddy.\"",
      "The Virginia Democrat said, \"It's time for Congress to rein in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say-so, which is not what the Constitution allowed.\"",
      "Kaine has twice tried to pass war powers resolutions aimed at preventing the president from conducting strikes against Venezuela, earning support from two Republicans.",
      "\"That was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela, and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed,\" Kaine said.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday that Venezuela's airspace should be considered \"CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\" The post comes as the administration has increased pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, with signs that military action, including possible ground action, could be imminent.",
      "Kaine said if there's ground action, the numbers in the Senate would change. And he noted that he would move \"immediately\" on a war powers resolution \"should there be military action.\"",
      "\"The circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote,\" Kaine said. \"We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations \u2014 so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth \u2014 we do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.\"",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who sits on the Armed Services Committee and previously led the House Intelligence Committee, also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. He said \"Congress does not have information\" that the reported follow-on strike occurred.",
      "\"If that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that that would be an illegal act,\" Turner added.",

      "Washington \u2014 GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio expressed concern Sunday that the White House-backed proposed plan to end the war in Ukraine is too pro-Russia, while urging that any peace arrangement must look at Russia as a \"skeptical adversary.\"",
      "Turner said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the president's \"goal of peace is incredibly important,\" while acknowledging comments made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio's supporting a sovereign Ukraine as negotiators gathered in Miami on Sunday morning.",
      "The team of Ukrainian negotiators began meeting Sunday morning with Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law. Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow later this week.",
      "As the meeting kicked off Sunday, Rubio outlined that \"the end goal is obviously not just the end of the war,\" but also \"securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.\"",
      "Rubio's comments come after the White House floated a peace proposal earlier this month that critics said favored Russia, initially including several provisions that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had rejected in the past. But the plan has since been revised, Mr. Trump has outlined, citing progress on both sides.",
      "Asked by CBS' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes whether he still has concerns about the plan being too pro-Russia, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and formerly chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said \"I think we all have those concerns.\" But he added, \"one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have, you can't be America First and pro-Russia, because Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States.\"",
      "\"It's fielding new, advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States, it's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber, it continuously identifies both NATO and the west, the United States, as its adversary,\" Turner said. \"You have to understand that the balance of this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.\"",
      "Asked about a transcript of a call published by Bloomberg in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching a Kremlin aide on how to negotiate with President Trump, Turner said \"the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelenskyy was on his way to the White House.\"",
      "Turner said \"this is not a military against military action, they are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine.\"",
      "\"The Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian, murderous Putin,\" Turner added.",
      "As for Witkoff, Turner said \"I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during the long, stretched out aspects of negotiations as reflective. But I think it's certainly important that when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern.\"",
      "\"The orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy's is very concerning,\" Turner said. \"Because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent. And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.\"",
      "On Sunday afternoon, Rubio called the day's meeting \"another very productive session,\" reiterating the intention to end the war while also working to \"help Ukraine be safe forever.\" He called it a \"shared vision.\"",
      "\"But there's more work to be done,\" Rubio said after the meeting. \"This is delicate, it's complicated, there are a lot of moving parts, and obviously there's another party involved here that will have to be a part of the equation, and that will continue later this week when Mr. Witkoff travels to Moscow.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 30, 2025.",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the fight against hunger in the United States. According to government data, 47.4 million people lived in what the Department of Agriculture calls a food insecure household in 2023. That's when a household can't necessarily obtain enough food to feed all of its members. One of the largest groups working to combat food insecurity is Feeding America, and we're joined now by CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, who is in Charleston, South Carolina this morning. Claire, thanks so much for being with us, and happy Thanksgiving.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Thanks for having me back.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Absolutely. So during the shutdown, we saw these incredibly long lines at food banks. The shutdown has now been over for a couple of weeks. SNAP benefits are going out again, but even before the shutdown, food insecurity was at its highest rate in nearly a decade. So, what is the situation now that you're seeing at food banks around the country as we head into the holidays?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah. So I'm so glad that you- you made that point. I- I think your viewers may be surprised to learn that food insecurity rates before the shutdown were higher than at any point during the pandemic, as an example. We're continuing to see very high demand. I think part of the reason is because the fastest growing group of people turning to the charitable food system, they're people who don't even qualify for any federal nutrition programs so this is an area that we've got to stay focused on. We know the kinds of things that work. We need to do those things so that we can really address what's happening with hunger and poverty in the country,",
      "NANCY CORDES: What do you think is contributing to the rise in hunger and this group of people who, as you say, don't qualify for benefits, but are showing an increased need for food?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah, I think it's that the system is broken. Right now, there's so many people, if you can imagine, in this country who can't afford to get a raise at work, because we have a system that does not incentivize people to continue to move up the ladder. We've got ladders with big missing rungs, if you will, so we can do something about that. We could have a sliding scale, for instance, that allows people to move out of poverty. By doing that, because food insecurity is actually a symptom of poverty, they'll move out of that as well. We as a nation should all want people to be able to provide for themselves. We should all want them to be able to get work that they can feel proud of and support their families with. We have the power to do all of those things, it will require that we work together, that we be honest about what's broken, and that we really get committed about fixing those things.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What are the main challenges that the organizations in your network are facing this holiday season as they try to feed people who are hungry? Is the food there for the people who need it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: \u00a0Yeah, unfortunately, the lines are longer than- than the food that is available, and one of the hardest things to witness will be seeing these people who have the same dreams, aspirations for their kids and themselves, as I have for mine and all of your viewers have for theirs, feeling the need to turn to the charitable food system. It takes a lot of courage and resiliency and commitment to family ofttimes to be able to do that, and then for them to turn up in spite of all of those barriers, and not- us not be able to provide them with what they really need so I have a deep respect for people experiencing hunger in this country. I've been a person who's experienced hunger before. I know many people who have, many people who still do, so many of them are my heroes. And then another set of heroes that I have are people working in this fight in the Feeding America network, who show up shoulder to shoulder with people experiencing hunger, who are so deeply committed to their well being. So we need to position people experiencing hunger to be able to fend for themselves, and we need to position food banks to be able to provide them with the support that they need in this moment, until they get there.",
      "NANCY CORDES: As you know, there are about two million Americans who are going to be affected by changes to the SNAP program that were made earlier this year in a vote by Congress. They will not be receiving SNAP benefits any longer. What are the economic implications of that? And in about 30 seconds, what can your organizations do about it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: According to the Congressional Budget Office, we're probably looking at about a six billion meal per year gap that's going to be created. So the kinds of things that we ought to do: we ought to address fraud where it exists. We ought to incentivize people to be able to get the hand up that they need and to move out of poverty. We ought to address error rates, but we ought to do all of these things strategically, and we ought to do them in a bipartisan way. This ought to be the kind of thing that this country can come together around, that we can hold hands shoulder to shoulder, because when people experiencing hunger win, we all do.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, we have to leave it there. We've got a hard out. But thank you so much, Claire Babineaux-Fontenot from Feeding America. Thank you so much.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 30, 2025.",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Kevin, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Great to be here.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So we've all eaten the turkey. Holiday shopping has begun in earnest. So let's talk about what the holiday shopping season looks like. We've got new surveys from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America that paint a modest picture of the holiday spending outlook. They say low and middle income Americans are planning to pull back a little bit because they perceive that prices are higher. And they say if spending is up this year, it's going to be because goods, in part, are more expensive. Is this the temporary result or long term result of the Trump tariffs?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, what we've seen- those were reports about what people anticipated would happen over the Thanksgiving weekend, but we now have hard data for Black Friday and even for Saturday and the online sales were up almost 10%, in store sales were up 4%, it was really a blockbuster weekend after Thanksgiving. And so I think that the folks who are saying, wow, maybe people are going to be anxious about going back and getting presents for the kids and so on. They've been disproven this weekend. And I think the reason is that people- incomes are up this year. We had a great jobs report and with strong income and the government shut down over so that people presumably have a little pent up demand as well. I think that we're looking at a great recovery from a weak few weeks because of the shutdown.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sure. I'm wondering how much of that spending increase you think is attributable to the fact that prices are up. Let me give you an example. The maker of Tonka Trucks said a couple days ago that a toy truck that cost $30 last year is going to cost $40 this year, partly because they lost about eight weeks of shipping due to the U.S. trade war with China. What's your advice to holiday shoppers who don't want to spend more this year than they did last year, or can't afford to spend more?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, as you know, it depends on what you're looking at. Like egg prices are down. Gasoline prices drop below $2 a gallon in a lot of places, mortgage rates are down--",
      "NANCY CORDES: --you mean below- gas prices on average are still at $3 a gallon.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah that's right for a few states they got below two. And so the point is just that- in the end, what matters is in the aggregate, the average across everything that everybody buys, and that averaged about 5% under Joe Biden, and is a little bit above two and a half percent- about cut in half for President Trump. And the bottom line, though, is really the wages have been growing faster than prices, and that's why real incomes this year are up by about $1,200 so far. That's why we could have a great Black Friday and a great Thanksgiving sales weekend because people feel like they have more money in their pockets. Even though you're right, there are some things that cost more, some things that cost less, but on average, we're about half the inflation rate of Joe Biden",
      "NANCY CORDES: Polls show that the public, despite some of the data you're presenting, is getting more skeptical. In our latest CBS News poll, 68% of Americans said they believe that President Trump's policies are pushing grocery prices up. They're up about 1.4% year to date. And economic sentiment, the number of people who think the economy is good, has actually dropped six points since he took office. How do you explain that?",
      "HASSETT: Well, first of all, you mentioned quite accurately, the 1.4% increase in grocery prices. I think the interesting thing about that is that that's way below the Fed's target of two for everything else, right? And so you'd have to concede that 1.4% is very, very low inflation. And so I think that the bottom line is that we've got the 'Big, Beautiful, Bill' cutting taxes on overtime, taxes for tips and so on, and all that money is going to start to be in people's pockets, and that's why they're optimistic about next year. Scott Bessent said last week that he's looking at first half of next year that could be in the 4% range. And the reason is that we passed the tax cuts in July, and so they didn't have time to change all the tax forms and everything. And so people are going to get really, really big refunds in the fall as well. And so we're really optimistic, and we think that the good news around Thanksgiving is a sign of something that's even stronger to come.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mentioned purchasing power. One thing that is going to affect purchasing power for 22 million Americans is the expiration of Obamacare premium subsidies. Last week, a funny situation. The White House floated this plan to extend the subsidies for two years, then you dropped the proposal, and then the President said on Air Force One, somebody said I wanted to extend it for two years. I don't want to extend it for two years. I'd rather not extend them at all. Was this a case of the right hand not talking to the left hand?",
      "HASSETT: No, I think that people were talking to each other. But what happened as, you know, as a professional journalist, is that sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional. And I think that somebody did that, and then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process, but President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care, and that's why we had $50 billion for rural hospitals in the 'Big, Beautiful, Bill,' why we tried to get $30 billion in for cost sharing. And the Democrats didn't like that. They had an alternative approach. And so I think that what we're going to see now, between now and Christmas, is that people are going to work- work this out, because we have a solution. The White House has a solution for cost- cost sharing, and the Democrats have an alternative. And, you know, people don't want for the few seniors that have really, really massive increases to see those. But don't forget, the vast majority of people in the Affordable Care Act are getting their insurance for less than $50 a month, and so- so while this is an issue that needs to be worked out, we don't want to cause panic for the folks who are worried that they're going to lose the thing that they have, it's really just the very, very high cost people who are closer to retirement age that have the problem.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Bloomberg is reporting, as I'm sure you know, that you are now considered the front runner to replace Fed Reserve Chair Jay Powell when his term expires in the spring. Secretary Bessent, who is heading up this search, said he was holding final interviews this week. How did yours go?",
      "HASSETT: You know, I am not sure that Bloomberg has the story right. I'm really honored to be amongst a group of really great candidates. The thing that I was most impressive about this week when that story leaked was that really, I think the news for markets was that President Trump is close to announcing a new person who is going to replace Jay Powell. And if you look at the market response to that, it was very, very positive. We had a great Treasury auction. Interest rates went down. And so I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who's going to help them, you know, have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates. And that's what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me, which, you know, is probably about as valuable as the rumor about the health care policy that we just talked about.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, I guess we'll find out if they're right sooner rather than later, when we hear the president's decision. So for now, Director of the White House, National Economic Council, that's your title today. Kevin Hassett, thank you so much.",
      "HASSETT: Thank you.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be back in a moment.",

      "NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We're joined by Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Absolutely, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to start out by asking you about the situation in Venezuela, because there are now serious signs that military action, including potentially ground action, could be imminent. You have tried twice to pass war powers resolutions that would force President Trump to get approval from Congress first before any military action. Twice, you have failed. Do you think the numbers on this will change if there is ground action, and will it even matter at that point?",
      "SEN. KAINE: I d- I do believe the numbers will change. You're right, I along with others, filed a resolution, no war in Venezuela or against Venezuela without congressional approval. It failed, but that was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela, and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed. I will move with colleagues, Senator Schumer, Senator Paul, Senator Schiff, immediately should there be military action. And then secondly, I also attempted to stop the, what I view as illegal boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific together with Adam Schiff, and the circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote. In each of these instances, we were able to get two Republicans to vote together with Democrats. We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations, so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth. We do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You're referring to this new Washington Post report that says that Secretary Hegseth called for everyone aboard, the first suspected drug boat that was targeted, to be killed when two people survived. The military went back in, reportedly with a follow-on strike. What questions do you have for the Pentagon about that situation?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, first, if that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DOD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance. And so this rises to the level of a war crime if it's true. And the questions that we've been asking for months are give us the evidence that the folks on board were really narcotraffickers. In one instance, there were two survivors, one Colombian, one Ecuadoran in a different strike. Instead of arresting them and prosecuting them, the U.S. picked them up and returned them to their countries of origin where they were released. So if they were narcotraffickers, why would we do that? We need more evidence about that. And we definitely need the administration to finally answer the question of why strike rather than interdict. If you know where the ships are, you can interdict. And when you do, you get evidence. You get individuals. You can squeeze them to give testimony against their higher-ups. You get evidence with the drug seizures. And finally, the other question that my colleagues and I are deeply worried about is the entire legal rationale for the strikes. We had to pry with a crowbar after weeks and weeks out of the administration. The supposed legal rationale for the strikes in international waters, it was very shoddy. Because it's classified, I can't tell you what's in it. But I can tell you it was not at all persuasive that these are legal actions. And so together with a whole series of things, the early retirement of the head of SOUTHCOM, the news that the SOUTHCOM's lead attorney said the strikes were not lawful, the decision of allies like the U.K. to stop sharing intelligence with the United States in this area because they believe the strikes are illegal. It's time for Congress to rein in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say so, which is not what the Constitution allows.",
      "NANCY CORDES: A lot of lawmakers on both sides have questions that are similar to the ones you're raising. On a related note, President Trump just announced this weekend that he plans to pardon former Honduras President Juan OrlandoHern\u00e1ndez, who was accused of conspiring with drug cartels to move 400 tons of cocaine from Honduras to the U.S. He's currently serving a 45-year sentence. Were you surprised by the President's plan to pardon him, given how strongly the President feels about drugs coming from other countries like Venezuela?\u00a0SEN. KAINE: This is shocking, and again, this is not an individual who was accused of running drugs to the United States. He was convicted in a federal court in the United States. One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House. And if he doesn't care about narcotrafficking, and this was also shown earlier this year with the pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, then what is this Venezuela thing really about? The President of Colombia has said that he thinks it's about the U.S. trying to seize oil assets in Venezuela. I lived in Honduras for a year as a missionary way back when. The conspiracy theories are running wild in the Americas about why this- this military effort is so important to the President when he's pardoning drug kingpins who are running drugs into the United States. These are also questions that we're going to have to dig deeply into when we return to Washington tomorrow.NANCY CORDES: I want to ask you about some big developments in Washington this week. The Trump administration is making big changes in the wake of this tragic shooting of two National Guard members. They are halting all asylum decisions. They are halting Afghan immigration applications. The President says he wants a permanent pause to immigration from what he calls \"third world countries,\" we don't know how many countries. Do they have a case that it makes sense to put some of these processes on hold while they figure out what happened here?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, you know, first, let's just acknowledge this sad fact, these two guards, members, Ms. Beckstrom andMr. Wolfe, what a tragedy for them and their families. And you know what? They should have been at home at Thanksgiving, celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, not deployed in a political deployment, to do law enforcement in D.C. that the D.C. police and other local law enforcement agencies can do. And this demonstrates, yet again, something we've seen so often our troops, including our guards members, they're going to serve in brave and courageous and self-sacrificing ways, and we can be so proud of them, but the orders that they get from their civilian leaders, that's where the problem comes in. Whether it's a Hegseth order to kill them all, or an order to send guardsmen and women in a political stunt deployment to cities around the country, these two individuals should have been celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, and I just mourn for them and all who suffer as a result. The President's decision to say, okay, this particular criminal who should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, who came in under an asylum grant, that President Trump and his administration decided this past summer, that now we're going to pause processes or asylum from 19 quote \"third world countries\" you don't know which ones they are. You shouldn't paint with a broad brush. Go after a criminal to the full extent of the law. But don't say that all Afghans in the United States, those who served with our military and who lost their lives and their health and their families in many ways by doing so, don't say that they're all bad. Don't say that people who come from third world countries are bad. Virginia, about one out of nine of us is an immigrant, and our immigrant communities in Virginia have been an enormous source of strength to our commonwealth and to our country. And it's wrong to target them all for the bad actions of an individual, just like we wouldn't target- target other communities in the United States for the bad actions of one individual.NANCY CORDES: Something tells me this is going to be a big topic of Congress- of conversation rather, in Congress--SEN. KAINE: --It will--NANCY CORDES: --this week. Senator Kaine, I really appreciate you being with us, and Happy Thanksgiving.SEN. KAINE: So glad we could do it. Thanks.\u00a0NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back.",

      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thank you, Nancy. Happy Thanksgiving to you also.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, you heard what Sam Vinograd just had to say about the vetting process. You've also heard what administration officials are saying about it. Do you believe that this was a failure of vetting, or do you believe this is someone who just became radicalized or became mentally disturbed here in the United States?",
      "REP. TURNER: This is very difficult, because, I mean, this is classic terrorism. And this is where an individual who tries to break the heart of a nation who doesn't enact a murderous act right before Thanksgiving and the- I think what Samantha is missing in all of this is that we didn't go to Afghanistan to bring Afghanis here. We went to Afghanistan to kill Osama bin Laden, to dismantle and destroy al-Qaeda, to avenge 9//11, to dismantle and to overthrow the Taliban and to ensure that Afghanistan was no longer a safe haven for terrorism. What occurred is that the Biden administration allowed Afghanistan to fall and fled, and in doing so, then found itself in a situation where those who had been aiding us were then at risk, and in doing so made the decision--",
      "NANCY CORDES:-- You don't think they would have been at risk either way?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, they were- their intention was that they would be still there. That Afghanistan would no longer be a safe haven for terrorists, that it would not be a return to the Taliban, and there would not be a need for those people to be evacuated. You wouldn't see American planes on the tarmac, as you showed with people running to try to get on them. By the way, those planes wouldn't be being chased by people if they were on their way to China or Russia, they were on their way to America, and those people were fleeing what the Biden administration was allowing to unfold, which is that it would once again be a nation that would be at risk to us. And so, you know, that's how you get to the situation where those individuals are at risk. Now, obviously the vetting was flawed. By your own report, you showed that individuals who were on our known terrorist watch list made it into this country through that process. So obviously that the vetting process\u2013",
      "NANCY CORDES:-- But then- then they were identified--",
      "REP. TURNER:-- but they made it in. They made it in, right? They made it into this country. So obviously the process was flawed, and it was also a process that should have been unnecessary, if there hadn't been this hasty fall of Afghanistan. In which the Biden administration had promised us all that they were not going to run for the exits. And they not only ran for the exits, they did so at night. You know, Congress was, you know, after hearing, after hearing, you know, raised the issues of the manner in which the Biden administration fled and what the consequences would be. And we're all living with this consequence now, the investigation is underway.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Weren't their hands tied in part by the fact that Trump had cut a deal with the Taliban promising to leave by a certain date?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, their hands were not tied. The manner in which they did so, and Congress did a number of investigations, at a number of hearings, and filed a number of reports that showed that it was the actions of the Biden administration, a manner in which they completely withdrew. But that investigation is underway. It's going to be underway as to this individual, and I think we all need to wait for that investigation to be concluded.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The President has called for 500 more National Guard troops to be sent to the nation's capital. Your state has already contributed 150. Do you believe that more troops being deployed is the answer, or do you think it's time to wind this deployment down?",
      "REP. TURNER: When you ask this, is that the answer? You have to first talk about what the question is, and the question is, is there a national issue of- of crime and safety? And certainly the American people, by all polls, indicate that people are experiencing it and report that there is. And certainly in the nation's capital, there has been- there has been unbelievable reports of just the- the criminal activity, though, the- those individuals who have succumbed to, you know, violent crime. And certainly, there's been a reporting that the National Guard presence has made a difference.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Right. No question, I think crime is down 30% something like that in DC in the last four months. I want to turn to Ukraine now, another issue very important to you. A team of Ukrainian negotiators is meeting right now in Miami with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. What's your understanding of where the negotiations stand right now. There were concerns initially that the White House plan was too pro-Russia. Do you still have those concerns?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think we all have those concerns. The- the- you know, the President's goal of peace is incredibly important, and we saw today with Secretary Rubio his statement of, you know, we have to have a strong and sovereign Ukraine, and I- and that's everyone's goal, and the- and certainly a prosperous Ukraine. And we saw the Ukrainian representative there, who is, you know, committed. And we certainly think, and I think everyone thinks that President Zelenskyy is committed to peace. But you know, one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have- you can't be America first and pro-Russia, because Russia has- is a self declared adversary of the United States. It's fielding new, advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States. It's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber. It continuously identifies both NATO and the West, the United States as its adversary. So in this and of course, when it identifies Ukraine as its adversary, it does so in identifying the West and the United States as its adversary. You have to understand that the balance of this- this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Speaking of the question of being pro-Russian, this week, Bloomberg got a hold of this transcript of a call between Steve Witkoff, the special envoy, and a Putin advisor, in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching the Russian on how to win over President Trump. And there are several Republicans that have great concerns about that. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania called it a major problem. Don Bacon of Nebraska said Witkoff fully favors the Russians and should be fired. What do you think?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelensky was on his way to the White House. And I wouldn't want any orchestration of lessening President Zelenskyy's relationship with Trump, because it's very important when you have negotiations that, especially as you have, you know- in this instance Russia is being, you know, obviously, unbelievably murderous of the Ukrainian people. It is an aggressive authoritarian regime in this it's killing civilians. It is- it is not just this. Is not a military against military action. They are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine. The- the Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and the President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian murderous Putin.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So given your concerns, should Witkoff continue to serve as one of the main US negotiators here and should he be sent by President Trump to Moscow this week to meet with Putin?",
      "REP. TURNER: I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during a long, stretched out aspect of negotiations as reflective, but I think it's certainly important that when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern. And the orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy is very concerning, and I think the White House should be very concerned about any efforts to orchestrate Putin's voice at the White House before Zelenskyy's because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent. And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.",
      "NANCY CORDES: President Trump said this was just regular deal making. I want to turn to Venezuela, because you're on the House Armed Services Committee. We've all been watching the military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. Just yesterday, the President said airlines should consider Venezuelan airspace closed. Do you take that to mean that a military operation is imminent?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, the President did not say that, and the President certainly has not given Congress any notice that that is going to occur. And he certainly has not made the case. There is a buildup that the President has not explained in a way that relates solely to the actions that are currently going down in the Caribbean, and with respect to the drug trade that the President has been discussing with Congress, it is certainly a significant concern in Congress.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The Washington Post is reporting that before the strike on the very first suspected drug vote in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered that everyone on board be killed, and then when two of the 11 people on board survived, a follow-on strike was ordered to finish them off in the water. Now some law of war experts are saying that that was illegal, that killing people who are no longer able to fight is a war crime. What is your view and what questions do you have for the Pentagon?",
      "REP. TURNER: Congress does not have information that that had occurred. Both the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and ranking members have opened investigations. Obviously, if that occurred, that would be- be very serious, and I agree that- that- that would- would be an illegal act. That is not the legal opinion or the information or the legal justification, the acts that have been described to Congress that are being undertaken in- in this. There are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so-called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification has been provided. But this is- is completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress, and there is an ongoing investigation.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Very interesting to hear you say that this might be an illegal act. I know your committee is asking more questions. We'd love to learn what you find out. Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio, thank you so much for being with us.",
      "REP. TURNER: I appreciate it.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

      "NANCY CORDES: I'm Nancy Cordes in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump escalates his anti- immigration crackdown after the deadly shooting of National Guard troops in D.C. And, as the president's team pushes for peace in Ukraine, the pressure campaign on Venezuela intensifies.",
      "The horrific shooting in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national, left one National Guard member dead and another fighting for his life, angering President Trump, who accused the Biden administration of allowing thousands of Afghans into the country without proper vetting.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Your DOJ I.G. just reported this year that there was thorough vetting by DHS and by the FBI of these Afghans who were brought into the U.S., so why do you blame the Biden administration for what this man did?",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Because they let him in. Are you stupid?",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, no.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Are you a stupid person? Because they came in to - - on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn't be here.",
      "(End VT)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Investigators have yet to find a clear motive behind the shooting, but President Trump isn't waiting. He's halting immigration from Afghanistan and elsewhere. We will bring you the latest on the shooting and the policy response.",
      "Plus: Russia launches a massive drone and missile strike on Kyiv, defying the U.S. push for peace in Ukraine.",
      "And the president warns commercial planes to clear the airspace over Venezuela. Is that a sign of an imminent attack by the U.S.?",
      "We will get the latest on both fronts from Republican Congressman Mike Turner and Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.",
      "And we will check in with President Trump's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, on the biggest shopping weekend of the year and get a reality check on the worsening hunger crisis with Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is off today.",
      "As Thanksgiving weekend draws to a close, for some, the holiday shopping spree is officially under way, while others are braving the crowds at airports and on highways to get home.",
      "Here in Washington, a simmering debate over immigration and national security has boiled over following the shooting of two National Guard members.",
      "Our homeland security and justice correspondent, Nicole Sganga, is here with the latest.",
      "You have been out front on this story, Nicole. What's the latest?",
      "NICOLE SGANGA: The targeted attack just blocks away from the White House killed 20-year-old Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. This morning, Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe remains in critical condition, fighting for his life.",
      "Moments ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Rahmanullah Lakanwal may have been radicalized on American soil, but argued the attack was the consequence of failed vetting.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "NICOLE SGANGA (voice-over): The investigation is under way. Intelligence analysts are now tasked with combing through the suspect's devices and online presence for signs of radicalization.",
      "So far, sources tell CBS News there have been no confirmed extremist ties. Rahmanullah Lakanwal served for eight years on a CIA-backed Zero Unit team, an Afghan paramilitary outfit notorious for intense combat and high-risk raids.",
      "U.S. and Afghan officials tell CBS News the suspect had been deeply disturbed by casualties in his unit and more recently troubled by the killing of his close friend by armed men in Pakistan. Lakanwal first entered the U.S. in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome following the fall of Kabul.",
      "The 29-year-old was granted asylum in the U.S. this April. Now he faces first-degree murder charges. A 2025 Justice Department audit found only 55 evacuees arriving to the U.S. under the program were flagged by terrorism- screening databases. Last year, just nine remained on the watch list.",
      "This weekend, D.C. police accompanied National Guard on their street patrols. Governor Patrick Morrisey oversees West Virginia's National Guard.",
      "What do you say to Americans who are watching this play out and, in the wake of this tragedy, they might feel like Guardsmen now have a target on their back?",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY (R-West Virginia): I think people who question the mission should look at what's happened in Washington, D.C., and you had a city that had a lot of problems with crime, and there have been clear and meaningful reductions. I think that matters a lot.",
      "(End VT)",
      "NICOLE SGANGA: President Trump has ordered 500 more National Guard members to D.C., bringing the total to nearly 3,000 troops.",
      "And, on Friday, the U.S. directed immigration officers to pause all asylum decisions, leaving over two million applicants in limbo, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Nicole Sganga, thank you so much for staying on top of this.",
      "And for more on the vetting of the suspect before he entered the country, we are joined now by Samantha Vinograd, who is a former top counterterrorism official at the Department of Homeland Security under President Biden and was deeply involved in the process for screening and vetting. She is now a national security contributor here at CBS News.",
      "Sam, so good to have you with us.",
      "Just this morning, the attorney general said that this suspect entered the U.S. with minimal to little vetting. Is that accurate?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, Nancy, I'm happy to talk about the vetting.",
      "But, at this point, we don't have indications that the horrific tragedy was a result of a vetting failure. Instead, the attorney general also said this morning it appears the individual was radicalized once here. And let's be clear on what the vetting system is and what it isn't.",
      "The vetting system is a system in which an individual's identifiers, their biographic information and biometric information, iris scans, fingerprints, facial images, are run against datasets of information about individuals with ties to terrorism and criminal history.",
      "The vetting system is not predictive of whether an individual with no derogatory information is or is not at some point going to become violent. What I can tell you is this. And I was involved in the process. Every Afghan evacuee underwent vetting overseas before they were cleared to be manifested for a flight to the United States.",
      "They underwent vetting once they were manifested for a flight at a port of entry before entering the United States. And then Afghan evacuees, including the suspect, were vetted again once in the U.S. by the Biden administration.",
      "And this suspect underwent the most comprehensive vetting under the current administration when he applied for asylum. That process would typically involve an interview and a review of social media handles.",
      "NANCY CORDES: OK, I hear what you're saying, but I want to read to you something that a DOJ inspector general report laid out earlier this year.",
      "They said that, when tens of thousands of Afghans arrived at once here in the U.S. at the end of the war \u2013 quote \u2013 \"The normal processes required to determine whether individuals posed a threat to national security and public safety were overtaken by the need to immediately evacuate and protect the lives of Afghans, increasing the potential that bad actors could try to exploit the expedited evacuation.\"",
      "Were there vetting corners that had to be cut here?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, during the Afghanistan withdrawal in the subsequent period, there were various priorities in place, certainly. We wanted to help our Afghan partners and bring at-risk Afghans here.",
      "But protecting national security and public safety was the foremost priority. And that's why a process was designed that vetted individuals overseas, but it was never intended to be a one-and-done. It was a multistage process with various U.S. government agencies.",
      "Afghan evacuees were vetted overseas by graphic and biometric vetting. And then there were other stages of vetting that occurred once individuals were here. So we have to put this vetting process in context.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Let's talk about this suspect specifically.",
      "What can you tell us about these so-called Zero Units that the suspect was a part of in Afghanistan? He worked with the CIA for years, right?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: He did, which means that he was vetted by the CIA prior to beginning work in the Zero Unit, which was a paramilitary and intelligence force that partnered with the CIA incredibly closely on some very intense missions.",
      "So this suspect reportedly underwent vetting by the CIA for the first time over a decade ago. He had highly specialized training. He did undergo vetting at the time that he started working with the CIA and went on some very complex missions. These units were accused of certain human rights abuses.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And, as you pointed out, the attorney general did say this morning that it's believed that the shooter was radicalized here in the United States.",
      "The AP is now reporting that his behavior deteriorated so sharply in recent months that a community advocate was afraid that he was suicidal. Where does this investigation go from here?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, this horrific tragedy could be the result of an individual that quickly mobilized to violence without any ties to foreign terrorism. And as we have discussed in other cases, trying to find lone actors before they initiate an attack is harder than trying to find a needle in a haystack.",
      "That work, trying to find a lone actor who's mobilizing to violence quickly, involves intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism officials here in the U.S., not vetting experts, but here in the U.S. at all levels of government, federal, state, and local, to try to find size \u2013 signs that an individual is mobilizing to violence and try to get them help before they actually initiate an attack.",
      "NANCY CORDES: When the president says that he wants to have everyone who came in here to the United States from Afghanistan, about 90,000 people, rescreened, reexamined, how would that work? And does DHS have the resources to do that?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, to be very clear, DHS is not the only entity involved in vetting. Various members of the counterterrorism, law enforcement, and intelligence community perform vetting.",
      "I do have questions about the number of resources available to engage in that exercise, just based upon resource constraints within the federal government. But it is possible. It will take time. But, to be clear, Afghan evacuees have been re-vetted since coming to the United States. They were re-vetted under the Biden administration.",
      "And then, as they have adjusted their status to asylum or other things, they had to go through already other vetting processes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You know, you talk about this suspect and trying to find signs that he was radicalized. How will investigators go about doing that?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, investigators are certainly already speaking to individuals that knew the suspect, friends, family, co-workers, the organizations that helped support him in the community.",
      "And we don't yet know, Nancy, whether this individual was known to law enforcement in his community. I think we will learn that in the coming days.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Great insight.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Thanks, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sam Vinograd, CBS News contributor, thank you so much.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Thank you.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We're joined now by Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Congressman, thanks for being with us. Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Thank you, Nancy. Happy Thanksgiving to you also.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, you heard what Sam Vinograd just had to say about the vetting process. You've also heard what administration officials are saying about it.",
      "Do you believe that this was a failure of vetting, or do you believe this is someone who just became radicalized or became mentally disturbed here in the United States?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Nancy, this is very difficult, because, I mean, this is classic terrorism. And this is where an individual who tries to break the heart of a nation who does an act, a murderous act, right before Thanksgiving, and the \u2013 I think what Samantha is missing in all of this is that we didn't go to Afghanistan to bring Afghanis here.",
      "We went to Afghanistan to kill Osama bin Laden, to dismantle and destroy al Qaeda, to avenge 9/11, to dismantle and to overthrow the Taliban, and to ensure that Afghanistan was no longer a safe haven for terrorism.",
      "What occurred is that the Biden administration allowed Afghanistan to fall and fled, and, in doing so, then found itself in a situation where those who had been aiding us were then at risk, and in doing so made the decision\u2026",
      "NANCY CORDES: You don't think they would have been at risk either way?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No, they were \u2013 their intention was that they would be still there, that Afghanistan would no longer be a safe haven for terrorists, that it would not be returned to the Taliban, and there would not be a need for those people to be evacuated.",
      "You wouldn't see American planes on the tarmac, as you showed, with people running to try to get on them. By the way, those planes wouldn't be being chased by people if they were on their way to China or Russia. They were on their way to America, and those people were fleeing what the Biden administration was allowing to unfold, which is that it would once again be a nation that would be at risk to us.",
      "And so, you know, that's how you get to the situation where those individuals are at risk. Now, obviously, the vetting was flawed. By your own report, you showed that individuals who were on our known terrorist watch list made it into this country through that process, so, obviously, that the vetting process\u2026",
      "NANCY CORDES: But then they were \u2013 then they were identified\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But they made it in. They made it in, right?",
      "NANCY CORDES: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: They made it into this country. So, obviously, the process was flawed, and it was also a process that should have been unnecessary, if there hadn't been this hasty fall of Afghanistan, which the Biden administration had promised us all that they were not going to run for the exits.",
      "And they not only ran for the exits. They did so at night. You know, Congress was \u2013 you know, after hearing, after hearing, you know, raised the issues of the manner in which the Biden administration fled and what the consequences would be. And we're all living with those consequences. Now, the investigation is under way.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Weren't their hands tied in part by the fact that Trump had cut a deal with the Taliban promising to leave by a certain date?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No, their hands were not tied. The manner in which they did so \u2013 and Congress did a number of investigations and a number of hearings and filed a number of reports that showed that it was the actions of the Biden administration, the manner in which they completely withdrew.",
      "But that investigation is under way. It's going to be underway as to this individual, and I think we all need to wait for that investigation to be concluded.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The president has called for 500 more National Guard troops to be sent to the nation's capital. Your state has already contributed 150.",
      "Do you believe that more troops being deployed is the answer, or do you think it's time to wind this deployment down?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, when you ask, is that the answer, you have to first talk about what the question is.",
      "And the question is, is there a national issue of \u2013 of crime and safety? And, certainly, the American people, by all polls, indicate that people are experiencing it and report that there is. And, certainly, in the nation's capital, there has been.",
      "There has been unbelievable reports of just the \u2013 the criminal activity, those \u2013 the \u2013 those individuals who have succumbed to, you know, violent crime. And, certainly, there's been a reporting that the National Guard presence has made a difference.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Right, no question, I think crime is down 30 percent, something like that, in D.C. in the last four months.",
      "I want to turn to Ukraine now\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \u2026 another issue very important to you.",
      "A team of Ukrainian negotiators is meeting right now in Miami with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. What's your understanding of where the negotiations stand right now? There were concerns initially that the White House plan was too pro-Russia. Do you still have those concerns?",

      "But, you know, one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have \u2013 you can't be America first and pro-Russia, because Russia has \u2013 is a self-declared adversary of the United States. It's fielding new advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States.",
      "It's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber. It continuously identifies both NATO and the West, the United States as its adversary. So, in this \u2013 and, of course, when it identifies Ukraine as its adversary, it does so in identifying the West and the United States as its adversary.",
      "You have to understand that the balance of this \u2013 this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.",

      "What do you think?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelenskyy was on his way to the White House.",
      "And I wouldn't want any orchestration of lessening President Zelenskyy's relationship with Trump, because it's very important when you have negotiations that \u2013 especially as you have, you know, in this instance, Russia is being, you know, obviously, unbelievably murderous of the Ukrainian people.",
      "It is an aggressive authoritarian regime in this. It's killing civilians. It is \u2013 it is not just \u2013 this is not a military-against-military action. They are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine.",
      "The \u2013 the Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and the \u2013 President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian, murderous Putin.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, given your concerns, should Witkoff continue to serve as one of the main U.S. negotiators here, and he \u2013 should he be sent by President Trump to Moscow this week to meet with Putin?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I \u2013 I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during a long, stretched-out aspect of negotiations as reflective, but I think it's certainly important that, when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern.",
      "And the orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy is very concerning, and I think the White House should be very concerned about any efforts to orchestrate Putin's voice at the White House before Zelenskyy's, because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent.",
      "And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And President Trump said this was just regular dealmaking.",
      "I want to turn to Venezuela, because you're on the House Armed Services Committee. We've all been watching the military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. Just yesterday, the president said airlines should consider Venezuelan airspace closed.",
      "Do you take that to mean that a military operation is imminent?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, the president did not say that, and the president certainly has not given Congress any notice that that is going to occur.",
      "And he certainly has not made the case. There is a buildup that the president has not explained in a way that relates solely to the actions that are currently going down in the Caribbean and with respect to the drug trade that the president has been discussing with Congress. It is certainly a significant concern in Congress.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \"The Washington Post\" is reporting that, before the strike on the very first suspected drug boat in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered that everyone on board be killed, and then, when two of the 11 people on board survived, a follow-on strike was ordered to finish them off in the water.",
      "Now, some law of war experts are saying that that was illegal, that killing people who are no longer able to fight is a war crime. What is your view and what questions do you have for the Pentagon?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Congress does not have information that that had occurred. Both the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and ranking members have opened investigations.",
      "Obviously, if that occurred, that would be \u2013 be very serious, and I agree that that would \u2013 would be an illegal act. That is not the legal opinion or the information or the legal justification, the acts that have been described to Congress that are being undertaken in \u2013 in this.",
      "There are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so- called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification has been provided. But this is \u2013 is completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress, and there is an ongoing investigation.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Very interesting to hear you say that this might be an illegal act. I know your committee is asking more questions. We'd love to learn what you find out.",
      "Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio, thank you so much for being with us.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thank you, Nancy.",

      "NANCY CORDES: Some sad news out of California overnight. Four people were killed and 10 others hurt when a gunman opened fire during a family celebration at a banquet hall in Stockton, California. The local sheriff's office says early indications suggest the shooting was targeted.",

      "We will be right back.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "We're joined by Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.",
      "Senator, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): Absolutely, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to start out by asking you about the situation in Venezuela because there are now serious signs that military action, including potentially ground action, could be imminent. You have tried twice to pass war powers resolutions that would force President Trump to get approval from Congress first before any military action. Twice you have failed. Do you think the numbers on this will change if there is ground action and will it even matter at that point?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I do \u2013 I do believe the numbers will change. You're right, I, along with others, filed a resolution, no war in Venezuela or against Venezuela without congressional approval. It failed. But that was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed. I will move with colleagues, Senator Schumer, Senator Paul, Senator Schiff, immediately should there be military action.",
      "And then secondly, I also attempted to stop the, what I view as illegal boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific, together with Adam Schiff. And the circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote. In each of these instances, we were able to get two Republicans to vote together with Democrats. We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations, so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth, we do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You're referring to this new \"Washington Post\" report that says that Secretary Hegseth called for everyone aboard the first suspected drug boat that was targeted to be killed. When two people survived, the military went back in, reportedly, with a follow-on strike.",
      "What questions do you have for the Pentagon about that situation?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, first, if that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DOD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance. And so this rises to the level of a war crime if it's true. And the questions that we've been asking for months are, give us the evidence that the folks on board were really narco traffickers. In one instance, there were two survivors, one Columbian, one Ecuadorian in a different strike. Instead of arresting them and prosecuting them, the U.S. picked them up and returned them to their countries of origin, where they were released. So, if they were narco traffickers, why would we do that? We need more evidence about that. And we definitely need the administration to finally answer the question of why strike rather than interdict? If you know where the ships are, you can interdict. And when you do, you get evidence. You get individuals. You can squeeze them to give testimony against their higher ups. You get evidence with the drug seizures.",
      "And finally, the other question that my colleagues and I are deeply worried about, is the entire legal rationale for these strikes. We had to pry with a crowbar, after weeks and weeks, out of the administration the supposed legal rationale for the strikes in international waters. It was very shoddy because it's classified. I can't tell you what's in it, but I can tell you it was not at all persuasive that these are legal actions. And so together with a whole series of things, the early retirement of the head of SOUTHCOM, the news that the SOUTHCOM's lead attorney said these strikes were not lawful, the decision of allies, like the U.K., to stop sharing intelligence with the United States in this area because they believe the strikes are illegal. It's time for Congress to reign in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say so, which is not what the Constitution allows.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Yes, a lot of lawmakers on both sides have questions that are similar to the ones you're raising.",
      "On a related note, President Trump just announced this weekend that he plans to pardon former Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was accused of conspiring with drug cartels to move 400 tons of cocaine from Honduras to the U.S. he's currently serving a 45-year sentence. Were you surprised by the president's plan to pardon him given how strongly the president feels about drugs coming from other countries like Venezuela?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: This is shocking. And again, this is not an individual who was accused of running drugs to the United States. He was convicted in a federal court in the United States. One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine. More than 400 tons.",
      "He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts. And less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narco trafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House. And if he doesn't care about narco trafficking, and this was also shown earlier this year with the pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, then what is this Venezuela thing really about?",
      "The president of Columbia has said that he think it's about the U.S. trying to seize oil assets in Venezuela. I lived in Honduras for years as a missionary way back when. The conspiracy theories are running wild in the Americas about why this military effort is so important to the president when he's pardoning drug kingpins who are running drugs into the United States. These are also questions that we're going to have to dig deeply into when we return to Washington tomorrow.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to ask you about some big developments in Washington this week. The Trump administration is making big changes in the wake of this tragic shooting of two National Guard members. They are halting all asylum decisions. They are halting Afghan immigration applications. The president says he wants a permanent pause to immigration from what he calls third world countries. We don't know how many countries. Do they have a case that it makes sense to put some of these processes on hold while they figure out what happened here?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, you know, first, let's just acknowledge this sad fact. These two Guards members, Ms. Beckstrom and Mr. Wolfe. What a tragedy for them and their families. And you know what? They should have been at home at Thanksgiving celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, not deployed in a political deployment to do law enforcement in D.C. that the D.C. police and other local law enforcement agencies can do.",
      "And this demonstrates yet again something we've seen so often. Our troops, including our Guards members, they're going to serve in brave and courageous and self-sacrificing ways. And we can about so proud of them.",
      "But the orders that they get from their civilian leaders, that's where the problem comes in. Whether it's a Hegseth order to kill them all or an order to send Guards men and women, in a political stunt deployment to cities around the country, these two individuals should have been celebrating Thanksgiving with their families. And I just mourn for them and all who suffer as a result.",
      "The president's decision to say, OK, this particular criminal, who should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, who came in under an asylum grant that President Trump and his administration decided this past summer, that now we're going to pause processes or asylum from 19, quote, \"third world countries,\" we don't know which ones they are, you shouldn't paint with a broad brush. Go after a criminal to the full extent of the law, but don't say that all Afghans in the United States, those who served with our military and who lost their lives and their health and their families in many ways by doing so, don't say that they're all bad. Don't say that people who come from third-world countries are bad.",
      "Virginia, about one out of nine of us is an immigrant. And our immigrant communities in Virginia have been an enormous source of strength to our commonwealth and to our country. And it's wrong to target them all for the bad actions of an individual, just like we wouldn't target other communities in the United States for the bad actions of one individual.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Something tells me this is going to be a big topic of conversation in Congress this week.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: It will.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Senator Kaine, I really appreciate you being with us and Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: So glad we could do it. Thanks.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett.",
      "Kevin, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, White House National Economic Council): Great to be here.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, we've all eaten the turkey.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Holiday shopping has begun in earnest. So, let's talk about what the holiday shopping season looks like. We've got new surveys from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America that paint a modest picture of the holiday spending outlook. They say low and middle income Americans are planning to pull back a little bit because they perceive that prices are higher. And they say, if spending is up this year, it's going to be because goods in part are more expensive. Is this the temporary result or long-term result of the Trump tariffs?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, what we've seen \u2013 those were reports about what people anticipated would happen over the Thanksgiving weekend. But we now have hard data for Black Friday and even for Saturday. And the online sales were up almost 10 percent, in-store sales were up four percent. It was really a blockbuster weekend after Thanksgiving.",
      "And so I think that the folks who were saying, wow, maybe people are going to be anxious about, you know, going back and getting presents for the kids and so on, they've been disproven this weekend. And I think the reason is that people \u2013 incomes are up this year. We had a great jobs report. And with strong income and the government shutdown over so that people presumably have a little pent-up demand as well, I think that we're looking at a great recovery from a weak few weeks because of the shutdown.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sure. I'm wondering how much of that spending increase you think is attributable to the fact that prices are up? Let me give you an example. The maker of Tonka trucks said a couple of days ago that a toy truck that cost $30 last year is going to cost $40 this year, partly because they lost about eight weeks of shipping due to the U.S. trade war with China.",
      "What's your advice to holiday shoppers who don't want to spend more this year than they did last year, or can't afford to spend more?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, as you know, it depends on what you're looking at. Like, egg prices are down. Gasoline prices dropped below $2 a gallon in a lot of places. Mortgage rates are down.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mean below \u2013",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, mortgage rates are down.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Gas prices, on average, are still at $3 a gallon across the country, right?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, that's right. For a few states, they got \u2013 they got below $2. And so the point is just that, in the end, what matters is, in the aggregate, the average across everything that everybody buys. And that averaged about 5 percent under Joe Biden and is a little bit above 2.5 percent, about cut in half for President Trump.",
      "And the bottom line, though, is really that wages have been growing faster than prices, and that's why real incomes this year are up by about $1,200 so far. That's why we can have a great Black Friday and a great Thanksgiving sales weekend because people feel like they have more money in their pockets. Even though, you're right, there are some things that cost most and some things that cost less. But on average, we're about half the inflation rate of Joe Biden.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Polls show that the public, despite some of the data you're presenting, is getting more skeptical. In our latest CBS News poll, 68 percent of Americans said they believe that President Trump's policies are pushing grocery prices up. They're up about 1.4 percent year to date. And economic sentiment, the number of people who think the economy is good, has actually dropped six points since he took office.",
      "How do you explain that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, you mentioned, quite accurately, the 1.4 percent increase in grocery prices. I think the interesting thing about that is that that's way below the Fed's target of two for everything else, right? And so you'd have to concede that 1.4 percent is very, very low inflation.",
      "And so I think that the bottom line is that we've got the big, beautiful bill cutting taxes on overtime, taxes for tips and so on. And all that money is going to start to be in people's pockets. And that's why they're optimistic about next year.",
      "Scott Bessent said last week that he's looking at the first half of next year that could be in the four percent range. And the reason is that we passed the tax cuts in July and so they didn't have time to change all the tax forms and everything. And so people are going to get really, really big refunds in the fall as well.",
      "And so we're really optimistic. And we think that the good news around Thanksgiving is a sign of something that's even stronger to come.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mentioned purchasing power. One thing that is going to affect purchasing power for 22 million Americans is the expiration of Obamacare premium subsidies. Last week a funny situation. The White House floated this plan to extend the subsidies for two years. Then you dropped the proposal. And then the president said, on Air Force One, \"somebody said I wanted to extend it for two years. I don't want to extend it for two years. I'd rather not extend them at all.\"",
      "Was this a case of the right hand not talking to the left hand?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, I think that people were talking to each other. But what happened, as you know, as a professional journalist, is that sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional. And I think that somebody did that. And then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process.",
      "But President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care. And that's why we had $50 million for rural hospitals in big, beautiful bill, why we tried to get $30 billion in for cost sharing and the Democrats didn't like that. They had an alternative approach.",
      "And so, I think that what we're going to see now, between now and Christmas, is that people are going to work this out because we have a solution \u2013 the White House has a solution for cost sharing and the Democrats have an alternative. And, you know, people don't want \u2013 you know, for the few seniors that have really, really massive increases to see those.",
      "But don't forget, the vast majority of people in the Affordable Care Act are getting their insurance for less than $50 a month. And so while this is an issue that needs to be worked out, we don't want to cause panic for the folks who are worried that they're going to lose the thing that they have. It's really just the very, very high cost people who are, you know, closer to retirement age that have the problem.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \"Bloomberg\" is reporting, as I'm sure you know, that you are now considered the frontrunner to replace Fed Reserve Chair Jay Powell when his term expires in the spring. Secretary Bessent, who is heading up this search, said he was holding final interviews this week. How did yours go?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, I am not sure that \"Bloomberg\" has the story right. I'm really honored to be amongst a group of really great candidates. The thing that I was most impressed about this week when that story leaked was that really I think the news for markets was that President Trump is close to announcing a new person who's going to replace Jay Powell. And if you look at the market response to that, it was very, very positive. We had a great Treasury auction. Interest rates went down.",
      "And so, I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who's going to help them, you know, have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates. And that's what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me, which, you know, is probably about as valuable as the rumor about the health care policy that we just talked about.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, I guess we'll find out if they're right, sooner rather than later, when we hear the president's decision.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. That's true.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, for now, director of the White House National Economic Council, that's your title today, Kevin Hassett, thank you so much.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes. Thank you.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the fight against hunger in the United States. According to government data, 47.4 million people lived in what the Department of Agriculture calls a food insecure household in 2023. That's when a household can't necessarily obtain enough food to feed all of its members.",
      "One of the largest groups working to combat food insecurity is Feeding America. And we're joined now by CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, who is in Charleston, South Carolina, this morning.",
      "Claire, thanks so much for being with us and Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT (CEO, Feeding America): Thanks for having me back.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Absolutely.",
      "So, during the shutdown, we saw these incredibly long lines at food banks. The shutdown has now been over for a couple of weeks. SNAP benefits are going out again. But even before the shutdown, food insecurity was at its highest rate in nearly a decade. So, what is the situation now that you're seeing at food banks around the country as we head into the holidays?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes. So, I'm so glad that you made that point. I think your viewers may be surprised to learn that food insecurity rates before the shutdown were higher than at any point during the pandemic as an example.",
      "We're continuing to see very high demand. I think part of the reason is because the fastest growing group of people turning to the charitable food system are people who don't even qualify for any federal nutrition programs. So, this is an area that we've got to stay focused on. We know the kinds of things that work. We need to do those things so that we can really address what's happening with hunger and poverty in the country.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What do you think is contributing to the rise in hunger and this group of people who, as you say, don't qualify for benefits but are showing an increased need for food?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes, I think it's that the system is broken. Right now there's so many people, if you can imagine, in this country who can't afford to get a raise at work because we have a system that does not incentivize people to continue to move up the ladder. We've got ladders with big \u2013 missing rungs, if you will. So, we can do something about that. We could have a sliding scale, for instance, that allows people to move out of poverty. By doing that, because food insecurity is actually a symptom of poverty, they'll move out of that as well.",
      "We, as a nation, should all want people to be able to provide for themselves. We should all want them to be able to get work that they can feel proud of and support their families with. We have the power to do all of those things. It will require that we work together, that we be honest about what's broken, and that we really get committed about fixing those things.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What are the main challenges that the organizations in your network are facing this holiday season as they try to feed people who are hungry? Is the food there for the people who need it?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes, unfortunately, the lines are longer than the food that is available. And one of the hardest things to witness will be seeing these people who have the same dreams, aspirations for their kids and themselves as I have for mine, and all of your viewers have for theirs, feeling the need to turn to the charitable food system. It takes a lot of courage and resiliency and commitment to family off times to be able to do that. And then for them to turn up, in spite of all of those barriers and not \u2013 us not be able to provide them with what they really need.",
      "So, I have a deep respect for people experiencing hunger in this country. I have been a person who has experienced hunger before. I know many people who have, many people who still do. So many of them are my heroes.",
      "And then another set of heroes that I have are people working in this fight in the Feeding America network who show up, shoulder to shoulder with people experiencing hunger, who are so deeply committed to their wellbeing. So, we need to position people experiencing hunger to be able to fend for themselves, and we need to position food banks to be able to provide them with the support that they need in this moment until they get there.",
      "NANCY CORDES: As you know, there are about two million Americans who are going to be affected by changes to the SNAP program that were made earlier this year in a vote by Congress. They will not be receiving SNAP benefits any longer. What are the economic implications of that? And in about 30 seconds, what can your organizations do about it?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: According to the Congressional Budget Office, we're probably looking at about a six billion meal per year gap that's going to be created. So, the kinds of things that we ought to do, we ought to address fraud where it exists. We ought to incentivize people to be able to get the hand up that they need and to move out of poverty. We ought to address error rates. But we ought to do all of these things strategically, and we ought to do them in a bipartisan way. This ought to be the kind of thing that this country can come together around.",
      "NANCY CORDES: OK.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: And we can hold hands, shoulder to shoulder, because when \u2013 people experiencing hunger when we all do.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, we have to leave it there. We've got a hard out. But thank you so much, Claire Babineaux-Fontenot from Feeding America. Thank you so much.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Sunday that the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members near the White House last week was \"radicalized since he's been here in this country\" after arriving in Sept. 2021 from Afghanistan.",
      "Officials have said the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national, entered the U.S. as part of Operation Allies Welcome after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Lakanwal was granted asylum by the Trump administration earlier this year. The CIA said Thursday that Lakanwal previously worked with the U.S. government, including the CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar that ended in 2021 following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "Since Wednesday's shooting, the Trump administration has ordered all asylum applications paused, according to an internal directive obtained by CBS News and two sources familiar with the order.",
      "\"We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him,\" Noem said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" She provided no further details.",
      "On Wednesday, a gunman opened fire near the White House on National Guard members stationed in Washington. One of the victims, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died Thursday, while the other, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized.",
      "The suspect was shot by a National Guard member and is also hospitalized. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said he faces murder charges.",
      "On ABC's \"This Week,\" Noem suggested the suspect was not thoroughly vetted before he came to the U.S.",
      "\"What they did was check a few names and a few data points,\" Noem alleged. \"But what President Trump has put in place now for vetting is biometric information, checking social media platforms, communications, contacts, matching updates of service that was never done under Joe Biden. He didn't do that. In fact, he brought people to this country and then just said, well, we'll vet them later.\"",
      "The White House has blamed policies of former President Joe Biden's administration for allowing Lakanwal to enter the U.S. Samantha Vinograd, a top counterterrorism official in the Obama administration and a current CBS News contributor, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that there are no indications the \"horrific tragedy was a result of a vetting failure.\"",
      "\"Let's be clear on what the vetting system is and it isn't,\" Vinograd said. \"The vetting system is a system in which an individual's identifiers \u2014 their biographic information, iris scans, fingerprints, facial images \u2014 are run against data sets of information about individuals with ties to terrorism and criminal history. The vetting system is not predicative of whether an individual with no derogatory information is or is not going to become violent.\"",
      "Vinograd said every Afghan refugee underwent vetting overseas before being cleared to enter the U.S., and then they were vetted again by the Biden administration. The suspect in last week's shooting also underwent the \"most comprehensive vetting\" under the Trump administration to receive asylum, Vinograd added.",
      "Since the shooting, the White House has put in place a number of restrictive immigration policies. On Thursday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director ordered, at Mr. Trump's direction, a \"full scale, rigorous reexamination\" of green card cases involving nationals affected by a presidential proclamation that fully or partially suspended travel and immigration from 19 countries.",

      "Venezuela said the U.S. has unilaterally suspended its migrant repatriation flights and seeks to \"undermine the sovereignty of its airspace,\" after President Donald Trump posted on social media that the country's airspace should be considered as \"closed in its entirety.\"",
      "In a statement released Saturday \u2014 in response to the message posted earlier by Mr. Trump \u2014 Venezuela's government demanded \"unrestricted respect\" for its airspace. \"Such statements constitute a hostile, unilateral, and arbitrary act, incompatible with the most basic principles of international law, and are part of a permanent policy of aggression against our country,\" the Venezuelan government release read in part.",
      "Mr. Trump had said in a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0that all airlines, pilots, drug dealers, and human traffickers should consider the airspace \"above and surrounding\" the South American nation as \"closed in its entirety\" \u2014 an assertion that appeared to signal further\u00a0U.S. pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about Mr. Trump's post, and it was unclear whether he was announcing a new policy or simply reinforcing the messaging around his\u00a0campaign against Maduro, which has involved\u00a0multiple strikes\u00a0in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean on small boats accused of ferrying drugs as well as a\u00a0buildup of naval forces\u00a0in the region.",
      "More than 80 people have been killed in such strikes since early September.",
      "International airlines last week began to cancel flights to Venezuela after the Federal Aviation Administration told pilots to be cautious flying around the country because of heightened military activity. Three U.S. airlines that regularly fly over Venezuela airspace confirmed to CBS News earlier this month that they had not been using the country's airspace for a while.",
      "The FAA's jurisdiction is generally limited to the United States and its territories. The agency does routinely warn pilots about the dangers of flying over areas with ongoing conflicts or military activity around the globe, as it did earlier this month with Venezuela. The agency, which works with other countries and the International Civil Aviation Organization on international issues, urged civilian aircraft in Venezuelan airspace to \"exercise caution\" due to the \"worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela.\"",
      "\"No authority outside the Venezuelan institutionality has the power to interfere, block or condition the use of national airspace,\" the Venezuelan government said in its statement Saturday, citing ICAO rules. It also said that flights that were part of a plan to repatriate Venezuelan migrants had been \"unilaterally suspended\" as a result of U.S. actions.",
      "The FAA and ICAO did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to ratchet up pressure on Maduro. The U.S. government does not view Maduro as the legitimate leader of the oil-rich but increasingly impoverished South American nation and he faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.",

The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations. With the aircraft carrier's arrival, the \"Operation Southern Spear\" mission includes nearly a dozen Navy ships and about 12,000 sailors and Marines.",
      "There are bipartisan calls for greater oversight of the U.S. strikes against vessels in the region after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for all crew members to be killed as part of the Sept. 2 attack on suspected drug smugglers.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Friday directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers to pause all asylum decisions in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., according to an internal directive obtained by CBS News and two sources familiar with the order.",
      "The move is the administration's latest effort to tighten the American immigration system after Wednesday's attack, which was allegedly carried out by an Afghan man who was granted asylum by U.S. immigration officials earlier this year.",
      "Asylum officers at USCIS, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, were instructed to refrain from approving, denying or closing asylum applications received by the agency, according to the internal notice and sources, who requested anonymity to describe an action that has not been publicly announced.",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration said it would start a review of asylum approvals under the Biden administration, citing the shooting of the two National Guard members, one of whom has died. The man accused of shooting the soldiers, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021 during former President Joe Biden's presidency and was granted asylum this spring under the second Trump administration.",
      "The action relayed to USCIS asylum officers internally on Friday amounts to an indefinite pause on asylum adjudications for all nationalities. Asylum cases are filed by foreigners who claim they will suffer persecution if deported or returned to their home countries because of certain factors, including their race, nationality, religion or political views.",
      "\"Do not enter any decision information for affirmative cases,\" a USCIS notice to asylum officers in one office read, referring to asylum cases overseen by the agency. \"Defensive\" cases, the other type of asylum applications, are filed by those facing deportation and are decided by federal immigration judges at the Justice Department.",
      "Officers were told the pause applied to all USCIS asylum cases, including those filed by Afghans who arrived under a Biden administration resettlement effort dubbed \"Operation Allies Welcome.\" They were also told that in-person appointments for asylum applicants to find out what decisions have been made on their cases would be canceled, at least for Monday.",
      "The guidance said officers could continue asylum application interviews and review cases up to the point of making a decision. \"Once you've reached decision entry, stop and hold,\" the directive said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Friday, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow confirmed CBS News' reporting.",
      "\"USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,\" Edlow said. \"The safety of the American people always comes first.\"",
      "According to Homeland Security officials, Lakanwal was allowed to enter the U.S. in September 2021 through the humanitarian parole policy, which the Biden administration used to resettle tens of thousands of Afghans evacuated following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. He applied for asylum in 2024 and his application was granted earlier this year, the officials said.",
      "Following Wednesday's shooting, the Trump administration has unveiled a series of immigration measures it argues will bolster the government's ability to mitigate the chances of similar attacks.",
      "Officials first announced an indefinite pause on the processing of all legal immigration applications \u2014 ranging from citizenship and green card cases, to requests for work permits and asylum \u2014 filed by applicants from Afghanistan.",
      "Edlow, the USCIS director, then\u00a0announced he had ordered, at President Trump's direction, a \"full scale, rigorous reexamination\" of green card cases involving nationals affected by a presidential proclamation that fully or partially suspended travel and immigration from 19 countries. That list, released in June and which the White House referred to as a \"travel ban,\" includes Afghanistan and other countries in Asia and the Middle East, such as Iran, as well as African nations, including Somalia and Sudan. Mr. Trump's order also applies to nationals of Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela.",
      "USCIS published a policy Thursday that allows adjudicators to cite concerns about the inability to properly vet and identify green card applicants from the group of 19 countries as a potential reason to deny their cases.",
      "\"Certain countries (including but not limited to Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Venezuela) lack a competent or central authority for issuing passports and civil documents among other concerns, which directly relates to USCIS' ability to meaningfully assess eligibility for benefit requests including identity, and therefore whether an alien warrants a favorable exercise of discretion,\" USCIS said in its guidance.",
      "Late Thursday, Mr. Trump vowed to \"permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,\" writing on Truth Social that his administration would revoke the citizenship of those it deems \"undermine domestic tranquility\" and deport any foreigner \"who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday he is canceling all orders signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen, a mechanical device that reproduces signatures.",
      "\"Any document signed\" by Biden via the use of an autopen \"is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect,\" Mr. Trump wrote\u00a0on Truth Social.",
      "\"I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury.\"",
      "Biden signed 162 executive orders during his presidency, according to the American Presidency Project. It's unclear how many were signed using an autopen, though it's not unusual for presidents to revoke their predecessor's directives.",
      "Mr. Trump has already rolled back dozens of Biden's executive orders. The president rescinded nearly 70 of Biden's executive orders shortly after he was sworn in on Jan. 20 for his second term and another 19 on March 14, according to the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump previously ordered an investigation into the Biden White House's use of the autopen to sign presidential documents like pardons, claiming there was a \"conspiracy\" to \"abuse the power of presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.\"",
      "In a July statement, Biden called Mr. Trump's claims \"nothing more than distraction.\"",
      "\"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said.",
      "House Republicans released a report last month that was critical of Biden's autopen use, but did not include clear evidence that his aides conspired to sign laws or other directives without his knowledge.",
      "Presidents have long used an autopen to sign documents. In 2005, the Justice Department under President George W. Bush said the president can legally use an autopen to sign bills into law.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has lashed out at several female reporters who have asked him questions or written critically of him in recent weeks, calling them \"ugly,\" \"stupid,\" and \"piggy.\"",
      "The most recent incident came at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday night, when CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes asked the president about the suspect in the shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who was let into the U.S. under the Biden administration and granted asylum under the Trump administration.",
      "Cordes pointed out that the inspector general of the Justice Department found that Afghans who entered the U.S. after the fall of Kabul in 2021 had been thoroughly vetted. She asked the president: \"So why do you blame the Biden administration \u2014\"",
      "\"Because they let him in. Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person? Because they came in on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn't be here, and you're just asking questions because you're a stupid person,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "On Wednesday, the president assailed New York Times correspondent Katie Rogers, who co-authored an article on his age and physical stamina in his second term, calling her \"third rate\" and \"ugly, both inside and out.\"",
      "The president's insults at Cordes and Rogers are just the latest in recent weeks that have been aimed at female reporters covering his presidency. While speaking to members of the press on Air Force One earlier this month, the president snapped at Bloomberg White House correspondent Catherine Lucey, telling her \"Quiet. Quiet, piggy.\"",
      "Lucey was asking the president about releasing the files from the Justice Department's investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Asked about the comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump is \"very frank and honest\" with reporters and contrasted the president's willingness to take questions from the press to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"I think the president being frank and open and honest to your faces rather than hiding behind your backs, is, frankly, a lot more respectful than what you saw in the last administration, where you had a president who lied to your face and then didn't speak to you for weeks and hid upstairs and didn't take your questions,\" she said. \"So I think everyone in this room should appreciate the frankness and the openness that you get from President Trump on a near daily basis.\"",
      "A Bloomberg spokesperson told the Washington Post that \"our White House journalists perform a vital public service, asking questions without fear or favor. We remain focused on reporting issues of public interest fairly and accurately.\"",
      "Then last week, while hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office last week, Mr. Trump berated ABC News chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce when she asked about the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. An intelligence report released by the Biden administration concluded that bin Salman ordered the attack on Khashoggi.",
      "Mr. Trump accused Bruce of embarrassing the crown prince with her question and later called her a \"terrible person and a terrible reporter.\" The president said her question was \"horrible\" and \"insubordinate.\"",
      "Wednesday's insult against Rogers was provoked by a New York Times article published Tuesday that examined the frequency of the president's public events and domestic travel, as well as the timing of his appearances on his public schedule. At 79, Mr. Trump is the oldest person elected to serve as president.",
      "Signs of bruising on his right hand as well as swollen ankles have prompted new questions about Mr. Trump's health. The president also revealed to reporters last month that he underwent an MRI during a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in April.",
      "Rogers' byline on the piece about Mr. Trump's aging in office is listed alongside another reporter, Dylan Freedman, a machine-learning engineer and journalist at the New York Times.",
      "The president attacked the Times and Rogers over the article, which he claimed was a \"hit piece.\" He called the newspaper a \"cheap 'rag'\" that is \"truly an 'enemy of the people.'\"",
      "\"The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.\u00a0 He did not mention the story's co-author.",
      "The New York Times defended the article and Rogers.",
      "\"The Times' reporting is accurate and built on first hand reporting of the facts. Name-calling and personal insults don't change that, nor will our journalists hesitate to cover this administration in the face of intimidation tactics like this,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"Expert and thorough reporters like Katie Rogers exemplify how an independent and free press helps the American people better understand their government and its leaders.\"",
      "The Society of Professional Journalists condemned Mr. Trump's attacks on Bruce and Lucey last week, which it said were not isolated and instead \"part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility \u2014 often directed at women \u2014 that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press.\"",
      "\"Journalists are not props at a photo op \u2014 they are watchdogs for the public,\" Caroline Hendrie, executive director of the group, said in a statement. \"When reporters ask hard questions about the murder of a fellow journalist, that is not an embarrassment. What's embarrassing is a leader trying to silence those questions.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday the National Park Service is going to start charging the millions of international tourists who visit U.S. national parks each year $100 per person to enter some of the most popular sites, while leaving them out of fee-free days that will be reserved for American residents.",
      "The fee change for international visitors will impact 11 national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, according to the Interior Department.",
      "As part of the changes, which are set to take effect Jan. 1, foreign tourists will also see their annual parks pass price jump to $250, while U.S. residents will continue to be charged $80, according to the department's statement.",
      "Only approximately 100 of the more than 400 parks in the national park system collect an entrance fee.",
      "The announcement declaring \"America-first entry fee policies\" comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time. The park service furloughed well over half its staff during the shutdown.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service \"continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!\"",
      "A White House social media post laying out the increased fees ended with the phrase, \"AMERICANS FIRST.\"",
      "The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to give U.S. residents \"preferential treatment\" over foreign visitors regarding \"recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules\" that parks might have in place.",

    "summary": "The discovery could cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the\u00a0species of the famous Lucy, scientists said Wednesday.",
      "The discovery is the latest twist in the tale of human evolution and could even cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species, Australopithecus afarensis, as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
      "Until the foot was discovered in Burtele in northeastern Ethiopia in 2009, Lucy's species was thought to be the only human relative living in the area more than three million years ago.",
      "But the appendage clearly does not belong to Lucy's species because it has an opposable toe \u2014 similar to a thumb \u2014 allowing its owner to grab onto tree branches like apes.",
      "The team of scientists who found the mystery foot went on to name a new species, Australopithecus deyiremeda, in 2015 based on some roughly 3.4-million-year-old jaw bones found in Burtele.",
      "The announcement was met with some skepticism in scientific circles. Due to the scarcity of fossils, attempts to add a new branch to the human family tree usually provoke fierce debate.",
      "The team was also unable to say that the foot bones \u2014 dubbed the Burtele foot \u2014 belonged to their new species.",
      "Now, in a study published Tuesday called \"Mystery owner of African hominin foot identified,\" the scientists announced that new fossils including a jawbone with 12 teeth found at the site show that the foot was that of A. deyiremeda.",
      "\"We have no doubt about the Burtele foot belonging to the same species as these teeth and the jaw,\" lead study author, Yohannes Haile-Selassie of Arizona State University, told AFP.",
      "The research also revealed more details about this species, offering further clues about who could have been the true ancestor of us Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Co-existence is deep in our ancestry\"",
      "A CT scan of the teeth suggested that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than its cousin Lucy, the study said.",
      "Isotope analysis of the teeth meanwhile showed that its diet consisted mainly of leaves, fruit and nuts of trees.",
      "The grasping big toe also suggested this human relative spent more time in the trees. Big toes played an important role in human evolution, allowing our ancestors to leave the trees behind and walk on two legs.",
      "A lingering question about A. deyiremeda was how it could have co-existed with Lucy's species at the same place and time, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "The new research suggests that the former spent its time in the forest, more likely eating from trees, while the latter spent more time on the ground, a difference that allowed them to live together.",
      "It also demonstrates that \"co-existence is deep in our ancestry\", Haile-Selassie emphasised.",
      "Earlier this year, in the same region where was Lucy was discovered, archaeologists found 3,000-million-year-old knives that are believed to be some of the first tools ever used on Earth.\u00a0 Rick Potts, the director of the Smithsonian's human origins program and the leader of research on the peninsula, told CBS News that discovery can\u00a0help frame humans' existence\u00a0on the planet.",
      "\"We are the last biped standing, as I call it,\" Potts said. \"All of those other ways of life became extinct. And so that gives us a lot to think about, and it draws attention to the fragility of life, even in our own journey through time.\"",
      "New technologies have made the sites easier to date, and new discoveries across eastern Africa have refined researchers' understanding of human roots. Researchers knew that modern homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they understood that their hominin ancestors began walking on two legs at least 6 million years ago.",
      "Search for the identity of our true ancestor",
      "John McNabb, a paleolithic archaeologist at the UK's University of Southampton not involved in the study, praised the new research.",
      "\"There will always be sceptics, but I think these new finds, and their validation of older ones, will help many researchers to be more accepting of A. deyiremeda,\" he told AFP.",
      "It also \"adds a new player into the mix\" in the search for the identity of our true ancestor, McNabb added.",
      "Because A. deyiremeda was more primitive and had a less human-like foot than Lucy, it is unlikely to dethrone her as the prime suspect in this search, both scientists agreed.",
      "But the discovery \"opens this possibility that we might still find more species within that time period because it looks like the Australopiths were experimenting with bipedality,\" or walking on two legs, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "\"Could there be another species which could be a better candidate to be the ancestor of the genus Homo?\" he asked.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dogs-wolf-dna-breeds-study/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 07:13:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Wolf DNA seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, scientists said.",
    "story": [
      "Those tiny, fluffy dogs walking down the street may look cute but beware \u2014 they probably have some wolf in them.",
      "That is the discovery announced on Monday by U.S. scientists, who were surprised to find that nearly two thirds of all dog breeds have a detectable amount of wolf DNA.",
      "And it is not genetic leftovers from when dogs originally evolved from wolves around 20,000 years ago, but instead suggests that domesticated dogs and wild wolves have interbred within the last few thousand years.",
      "This does not mean that \"wolves are coming into your house and mixing it up with your pet dog,\" Logan Kistler, a curator at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "It also seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, the scientists said.",
      "\"The majority of dogs today have low, but detectable levels of post domestication wolf ancestry that has shaped their evolution and conferred unique advantages to their survival in diverse human environments,\" the scientists conclude in a study published on Monday.",
      "Dogs and wolves can produce offspring together, but interbreeding is thought to be rare.",
      "\"Prior to this study, the leading science seemed to suggest that in order for a dog to be a dog, there can't be very much wolf DNA present, if any,\" lead study author Audrey Lin of the American Museum of Natural History said in a statement.",
      "To find out more, the team analyzed thousands of dog and wolf genomes in publicly available databases.",
      "They found that over 64 percent of modern breeds have wolf ancestry, with even tiny chihuahuas carrying around 0.2 percent.",
      "\"This completely makes sense to anyone who owns a chihuahua,\" Lin joked.",
      "Which dogs have the most wolf DNA?",
      "Czechoslovakian and Saarloos wolfdogs had the most wolf DNA, with up to 40 percent.",
      "For breeds used as pets, the most \"wolfy\" was the Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore hound, with around five percent of wolf DNA. Sight hounds such as Salukis and Afghans also ranked high.",
      "While dogs with wolf DNA tended to be bigger, this was not always the case \u2014\u00a0Saint Bernards did not have any.",
      "The research also showed that 100 percent of village dogs \u2014 which live on human settlements but are not anyone's pet -- have wolf ancestry.",
      "Kistler speculated that village dogs, which have more opportunities to get intimate with wolves, could be how wolf DNA was getting into the dog gene pool.",
      "Female wolves separated from their wolf pack by human activities such as habitat destruction could end up breeding with stray dogs, he suggested.",
      "Overall, \"Arctic sled dogs, pariah breeds, and hunting dogs have the greatest wolf ancestry, while on average, terriers, gundogs, and scent hounds have the least,\" the researchers write.",
      "Friendly or territorial?",
      "The researchers also compared their findings to the terms that kennel clubs use to describe the personalities of different breeds.",
      "Breeds with little or no wolf in them were more likely to be described as friendly, easy to train and affectionate.",
      "On the other hand, dogs with more wolf DNA were more often considered to be suspicious of strangers, independent, dignified or territorial.",
      "However, researchers said some descriptors occurred with similar frequency in low wolf and high wolf-content dogs, including \"intelligent,\" \"obedient,\" \"good with children,\" \"dedicated,\" \"calm,\" and \"cheerful.\"",
      "Kistler emphasized that descriptions of breeds are imperfect and do not predict the behavior of any individual dog.",
      "\"Wolves are evolved for specific habitats and specific conditions, and dogs have been carried to every corner of the inhabited world by people,\" he said.",
      "Dogs have simply had to adapt to the places humans took them, and \"wolf genes that gave them advantages in certain contexts,\" he explained.",
      "For example, many Tibetan breeds, such as the fluffy little Lhasa Apso, have a gene called EPAS1 that came from adapting to higher altitudes. Tibetan wolves have the same gene.",
      "The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

    "summary": "Researchers have documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life. NASA plans to return these core samples to Earth for laboratory analysis, but the delivery is on indefinite hold as the space agency pursues cheaper options.",
      "Blue Origin's Blue and Gold NASA satellites en route to study Mars",
      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",

    "story": [
      "American astronomer-turned-medical physicist and now NASA astronaut Chris Williams joined two Russian cosmonauts aboard a Soyuz ferry ship Thursday for a Thanksgiving Day flight to the International Space Station.",
      "With commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov at the controls of the Soyuz MS-28/74S spacecraft, flanked on his left by flight engineer Sergey Mikaev and on the right by Williams, the crew's Soyuz 2.1a booster roared to life at 4:27 a.m. Eastern and smoothly climbed away from the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, the Soyuz spacecraft was released from the booster's upper stage, its two solar wings unfolded and the crew set off in pursuit of the space station. Three hours later, they caught up with the orbital outpost and moved in for docking at the lab's Earth-facing Rassvet module at 7:34 a.m. Eastern.",
      "Williams, a former volunteer fire fighter and emergency medical technician who went on to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when he was selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "He and flight engineer Mikaev were making their first space flight on Thursday, while Kud-Sverchkov is a seasoned veteran who logged 185 days aboard the space station in 2020-2021.",
      "\"It's a really great crew,\" Williams said in a NASA interview. \"Sergey and Sergey are both just absolutely wonderful people, really kind, super interested, super intellectually curious, which is really fun. Had a lot of really, really great discussions, just talking and talking about things.",
      "\"It's been been wonderful to both spend some time with them over in Star City, and also to be able to spend some time with them in Houston through our training.\"",
      "The Soyuz MS-28 crew is replacing Soyuz MS-27/73S commander Sergey  Ryzhikov, flight engineer Alexey Zubritsky and NASA astronaut Jonny Kim,  who were launched to the space station last April. They plan to return  to Earth on Dec. 9 to wrap up their eight-month stay on the ISS.",
      "Also  on hand to welcome Williams and his crewmates aboard the station: NASA  Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Michael Fincke, Japanese astronaut  Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They launched atop a SpaceX  Falcon 9 rocket last August and plan to come home in February or March,  after their replacements \u2014 Crew 12 \u2014 arrive.",
      "All 11 station  fliers planned to gather for a traditional welcome aboard video call to  mission managers and family back in Moscow before a safety briefing and  the start of familiarization with the space station's complex systems.",
      "Williams, an Eagle Scout with a private pilot's license, is a standout among super achievers.",
      "After  graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in  physics, he was doing radio astronomy research on the way to a  Ph.D. and, \"down the street from my house, there was a volunteer fire  department. And I was like, oh, that sounds like something that could be  kind of like fun and interesting to do.\"",
      "\"So I started  volunteering. Got trained as an EMT and a firefighter, and started just  sort of doing that on a volunteer basis. And I found that I really liked  it. I got a lot of satisfaction out of knowing that ... at the end of  the shift, I would have really made a very direct and immediate positive  impact on somebody's life.\"",
      "He kept that up throughout graduate  school. Then, as he was winding up his doctorate in astrophysics,  Williams said he ran into a doctor he knew at a party who told him there  was \"a big need for physicists in medicine, in particular, in radiation  oncology, where we use radiation to treat cancer.\"",
      "He talked with a few other people, including one who had been an astronomer before switching to medical physics, and \"I was struck by how much of what I knew and had learned as an astronomer would actually be useful and apply very directly to medicine.\"",
      "\"A lot of the math behind (medical) imaging is the exact same math that actually you use in a radio telescope to make an image,\" Williams said. \"It was kind of neat to see that image processing techniques that I'd used as (a radio astronomer) actually carried over pretty directly into medicine.\"",
      "At the time of his selection as an astronaut, Williams was on the staff at Harvard Medical School as a clinical physicist and researcher. He is the second member of the 2021 class of astronauts to fly in space, getting assigned to the Soyuz MS-28 mission shortly after finishing astronaut candidate training.",
      "He said the training for launch on a Russian spacecraft was difficult, primarily because of the travel required. He credited his wife, Aubrey, with keeping the family's life on an even keel throughout.",
      "As for what he looks forward to during his eight-month stay in space, Williams repeated a familiar theme.",
      "\"I've got a lot of different goals, but I think the biggest one, and the thing I'm most excited about, is to truly be able to put my training into practice and to do a really good job to push forward the science and research that we're doing on on the space station.\"",
      "\"I think it's incredibly important. I think it's incredibly interesting and incredibly inspiring, and I feel really lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to that.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Nov 2025 11:42:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Tech giants including Alibaba, Amazon and Meta are counting on AI as the \"killer app\" that convinces consumers to try smart glasses.",
    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

    "summary": "AI is swiftly reshaping America's labor market, performing many technical and cognitive tasks across a range of industries, study says.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can do the work currently performed by nearly 12% of America's workforce, according to a recent\u00a0study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The researchers, relying on a metric called the \"Iceberg Index\" that measures a job's potential to be automated, conclude that AI already has the cognitive and technical capacity to handle a range of tasks in technology, finance, health care and professional services.",
      "The index simulated how more than 150 million U.S. workers across nearly 1,000 occupations interact and overlap with AI's abilities. Specifically, it measures exposure to AI capabilities and how the rapidly emerging technology overlaps with workers' occupational skills.",
      "The study doesn't seek to shed light on how many workers AI may already have displaced or could supplant in the future. To what extent such tools take over job functions performed by people depends on a number of factors, including individual businesses' strategy, societal acceptance and possible policy interventions, the researchers note.",
      "AI's uses extend far beyond some of its most visible applications, such as writing computer code, the researchers note. Among the ways employers across different industries are using AI:",

      "Manufacturers use the tech for quality control, including automating inspections",
      "Logistics operators are implementing AI to handle fulfillment",
      "The study analyzed workers' distinct skills and compared them to the abilities of more than 13,000 AI tools. In some cases, AI can augment human efforts, while in other types of work the technology is far more transformative, according to the researchers.",
      "For example, AI can streamline filling out paperwork, freeing nurses up to spend more time with patients. It can also quickly and accurately produce software code, forcing software engineers with limited skills to shift their focus.",
      "In addition, \"[F]inancial analysts will not disappear, but AI systems may demonstrate capability across significant portions of document-processing and routine analysis work,\" the researchers said. \"This reshapes how roles are structured and which skills remain in demand, without necessarily reducing headcount.\"",
      "AI is also already doing\u00a0some of the entry-level jobs\u00a0that have historically been reserved for recent college graduates or relatively inexperienced workers, the report notes.",
      "\"AI systems now generate more than a billion lines of code each day, prompting companies to restructure hiring pipelines and reduce demand for entry-level programmers,\" the researchers wrote. \"These observable changes in technology occupations signal a broader reorganization of work that extends beyond software development.\"",

    "summary": "Over the weekend, Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature that lets users see where an account is based \u2014 and it led to some surprises.",
    "story": [
      "They go by names like @TRUMP_ARMY\u2014 or @MAGANationX, and their verified accounts proudly display portraits of President Donald Trump, voter rallies and American flags. And they're constantly posting about U.S. politics to their followers, sounding like diehard fans of the president.",
      "But after a weekend update to the social media platform X, it's now clear that the owners of these accounts, and many others, are located in regions such as South Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe.",
      "Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature Saturday that lets users see where an account is based. Online sleuths and experts quickly found that many popular accounts posting in support of the MAGA movement to thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers, are based outside the United States \u2014 raising concerns about foreign influence on U.S. politics.",
      "Researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks online misinformation, identified several popular accounts \u2014 purportedly run by Americans interested in politics \u2014 that instead were based in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa.",
      "The accounts were leading disseminators of some misleading and polarizing claims about U.S. politics, including ones that said Democrats bribed the moderators of a 2024 presidential debate.",
      "Nikita Bier, X's head of product, announced Saturday that the social media platform is rolling out an \"About This Account\" tool, which lets users see the country or region where an account is based. To find an account's location, tap or click the signup date displayed on the profile.",
      "\"This is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square. We plan to provide many more ways for users to verify the authenticity of the content they see on X,\" Bier wrote.",
      "In countries with punitive speech restrictions, a privacy tool on X lets account holders only show their region rather than a specific country. So instead of India, for instance, an account can say it is based in South Asia.",
      "Bier said Sunday that after an update to the tool, it would 99.99% accurate, though this could not be independently verified. Accounts, for instance, can use a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their true location. On some accounts, there's a notice saying the location data may not be accurate, either because the account uses a VPN or because some internet providers use proxies automatically, without action by the user.",
      "\"Location data will always be something to use with caution,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech and a former director of the International Fact-Checking Network. \"Its usefulness probably peaks now that it was just exposed, and bad actors will adapt. Meta has had similar information for a while and no one would suggest that misinformation has been eliminated from Facebook because of it.\"",
      "Some of the accounts supported slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as well as President Donald Trump's children. Many of the accounts were adorned with U.S. flags or made comments suggesting they were American. An account called \"@BarronTNews_,\" for instance, is shown as being located in \"Eastern Europe (Non-EU),\" even though the display location on its profile says \"Mar A Lago.\" The account, which has more than 580,000 followers, posted on Tuesday that \"This is a FAN account, 100 % independent, run by one guy who loves this country and supports President Trump with everything I've got.\"",
      "Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS News these types of accounts are fueled by public interest in current events and America's highly polarized politics.",
      "\"It is shining a light on this new rage economy that exists on social media, including X, that takes advantage of current things,\" Krebs said. \"What's the latest event? As we've seen over the last couple of years ... there has been a rightward shift of the platform. And I think what we're really seeing here is foreign-based accounts that are looking to make a little bit of money and taking advantage of this.\"",
      "He added, \"I think X deserves some credit to shine a light, to kind of expose some of these. ... I suspect you'll see a bunch of these accounts lose influence.\"",
      "NewsGuard also found evidence that some X users are spreading misinformation about the location feature itself, incorrectly accusing some accounts of being operated from abroad when they're actually used by Americans. Investigators found several instances where one user created fake screenshots that appear to suggest an account was created overseas.",
      "It's not always clear what the motives of the accounts. While some may be state actors, it's likely that many are financially motivated, posting commentary, memes and videos to draw engagement.",
      "\"For the most visible accounts unmasked this week, money is probably the main motivator,\" Mantzarlis said. \"That doesn't mean that X \u2014 as documented extensively by prior work done by academic and nonprofit organizations that are being attacked and defunded \u2014 isn't also a target for state actors.\"",
      "Users were divided over the new ability to see an account's location information, with some questioning whether it went too far.",
      "\"Isn't this kind of an invasion of privacy?\" One X user wrote. \"No one needs to see this info.\"",

    "summary": "Luigi Mangione, the man charged with murdering the UnitedHealthcare CEO\u200b, is in court for hearings on which evidence will be allowed\u200b at trial.",
    "story": [
      "Luigi Mangione, the man charged with murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is in court Monday for pretrial hearings about which evidence will be allowed in his upcoming trial in New York City.",
      "Mangione has pleaded not guilty to nine state charges, including murder, as well as other federal charges that carry the possibility of the death penalty. Back in September, a judge dropped two other state terrorism charges against him.",
      "The 27-year-old's defense attorneys are arguing that certain evidence should be excluded from trial because of how they say it was obtained.",
      "Prosecutors with the Manhattan's district attorney's office have denied the defense's accusations, but the judge called for a series of suppression hearings to go over the concerns.",
      "The hearings are expected to last several days, and possibly all week. His trial date has not yet been set.",
      "A look inside the courtroom",
      "Mangione walked into court wearing a gray suit with a patterned button down shirt. He appeared to lift his eyebrows to acknowledge the court officers and his attorneys, but he did not look at the gallery. Per his attorneys' request, his restraints were removed before he sat down, so he can take notes.",
      "His attorneys had also requested he be allowed to wear civilian clothing during these hearings, rather than the tan prison clothing from his last court appearance. The judge granted him two suits, three shirts, three sweaters, three pairs of pants, five pairs of socks and one pair of shoes without laces that can be worn while he is being transported from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.",
      "Inside the courtroom, there appear to be roughly eight rows of journalists and three rows of the public, including some wearing shirts with Mangione's name or photo and the color green.",
      "Outside the courtroom, some people camped out to try and get a spot inside.",
      "The hearing was expected to begin around 10 a.m. but got off to a late start around 11 a.m.",
      "Mangione smiled as he chatted with his attorneys before the hearing began and took notes throughout.",
      "First look at Pennsylvania McDonald's surveillance video",
      "The first witness called to the stand was NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Sgt. Chris McLaughlin, who was asked to review surveillance images obtained in the hours and days after the shooting, including what appears to be a photo of Mangione standing at the counter of a Starbucks wearing a gray backpack and facemask with his nose showing, two photos of him inside an Upper West Side hostel without a facemask, and a Facebook post showing a man on a bicycle and a man with a gun.",
      "Mangione's attorneys objected to the relevance of the witness. While the photos were displayed, Mangione was seen taking notes and leaning over to speak with his lawyers.",
      "The prosecution also played video of the moment Thompson was shot nearly a year ago outside a hotel in midtown Manhattan, but stopped it before the husband and father of two fell to the ground.",
      "The second witness called to testify worked for the company that handled the security cameras at the McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where Mangione was taken into custody\u00a0days after the shooting.",
      "For the first time, prosecutors shared security video from a McDonald's in Pennsylvania where Mangione was arrested. There was no audio for it. In the video, Mangione can be seen sitting and eating, and at one point speaking with officers.",
      "A 911 coordinator from Blair County, Pennsylvania then took the stand, before court broke for lunch. A 911 call from a manager at the McDonald's was played.",
      "\"I have a customer here that some other customers were suspicious of,\" the manager said in the recording. The manager went on to explain that the customers were really upset, and thought he looked like the person police were searching for in connection with Thompson's murder.",
      "The surveillance video shows Managione sit down at a side dining room near the restroom at 9:01 a.m. At 9:28 a.m., two officers approach him, and he stands with his hands in the air. Employees and customers can be seen coming and going while this is happening.",
      "At one point, Mangione is seated again and seems to be eating while speaking with officers. At around 9:40 a.m., more officers show up, and Mangione is eventually seen standing and being searched.",
      "Here's what Mangione's attorneys are arguing",
      "Mangione's defense says statements he made to law enforcement should be suppressed, because they claim officers failed to provide Miranda warnings, which is when a suspect is informed of their constitutional rights.",
      "The defense also says evidence seized at the time of\u00a0his arrest at the McDonald's in Pennsylvania\u00a0shouldn't be allowed, because they claim law enforcement did a warrantless search of his backpack after he was handcuffed and surrounded by officers. Among the items inside the backpack were a gun with a\u00a03D printed receiver, ammunition and\u00a0a red notebook\u00a0he allegedly used as his diary.",
      "Defense attorneys don't want the notebook entries or other writings put into evidence at these pretrial hearings, claiming they will prejudice Mangione if they are made public and potential jurors hear about it.",
      "Lastly, the defense is also arguing against non-eyewitness identification testimony at trial, meaning someone who was not a witness to an alleged crime who makes an identification from a picture or video.",

      "Washington \u2014 The White House on Monday said that a U.S. attack on an alleged drug boat in September included more than one strike on the vessel, seemingly confirming a Washington Post report that the U.S. targeted the boat for a second time to take out survivors of the initial attack.",
      "The Post reported on Friday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors before the U.S. attack on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the first strike left two men alive in the water. The paper said the commander of the operation, Adm. Frank Bradley, ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the two. CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",
      "The report sparked calls for an investigation by lawmakers of both parties in Congress, some of whom raised the prospect that targeting the survivors could constitute a war crime. Hegseth has called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" claiming the operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the Post's report during the White House briefing on Monday. \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\" a reporter asked.",
      "\"The latter is true,\" Leavitt replied, before reading out a written statement. \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "President Trump said Sunday that he \"wouldn't have wanted\" the second strike but defended Hegseth's handling of the incident, saying the secretary told him he did not order the subsequent attack.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One, saying he has \"great confidence\" in Hegseth.",
      "He added: \"I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "A group of former military lawyers argued in an assessment on Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. In Congress, the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees pledged to investigate the matter. And Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that the strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" while GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio agreed that it \"would be an illegal act\" if true.",
      "The developments come as the U.S. has carried out close to two dozen boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean since the first attack on Sept. 2.",
      "Asked by CBS News if he has concerns about the boat strikes more broadly, Mr. Trump said Sunday: \"Very little, because you can see the boats, you can see the drugs in the boats and each boat is responsible for killing 25,000 Americans.\"",
      "\"The amount of drugs coming into our country by sea is infinitesimal compared to what it was just a few months ago,\" the president said.",

      "The announcement of a $45 fee for people without Real IDs comes after the TSA started requiring the identification or other approved documents in May. The Real ID is a federally compliant state driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card, identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "Passengers without Real IDs \"will be referred to the optional TSA Confirm.ID process for identity verification upon TSA check-in and prior to entering the security line,\" the TSA said.",
      "The process will vary from airport to airport, according to the agency, which said it is working with private vendors to allow consumers to pay for the screening process before they arrive at the airport. The TSA warned that people without Real IDs could encounter increased wait times at airports while their identities are verified.",
      "The fee verifies passengers for a 10-day period, according to the TSA. The agency is still urging passengers without Real IDs to visit their local DMV to update their IDs.",
      "The $45 fee is designed to ensure that travelers, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the advanced verification system, said Adam Stahl, a TSA official, in the statement.",
      "How does Confirm.ID work?",
      "Confirm.ID asks passengers without Real IDs to answer a series of questions about themselves to verify their identity.",

      "FBI directors are required by executive branch policy to use government aircraft for air travel, whether official or personal. That allows them to maintain access to secure communications wherever they travel and to move quickly in the event of an emergency. They must reimburse the government for personal flights at coach fare rates. Directors are permitted to take family or friends on personal trips, but the cost of their trips must be reimbursed to the government, as well.",

      "\"World Relief volunteers are trying to patch things for that family \u2014 but I think the father has mental health issues that are not addressed, and he won't talk to anyone,\" the email, sent the year before Lakanwal's asylum claim was approved, read in part.",
      "World Relief is one of the refugee resettlement agencies that assisted in the relocation of Afghan evacuees. Washington state took in nearly 3,000 Afghan nationals, including Lakanwal, his wife and their five sons.",
      "The family had been living in Bellingham, and Lakanwal drove across the country to Washington, D.C., before the attack, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said during a news conference last week. One of the victims, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died Thursday, while the other, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was critically injured and remains hospitalized.",
      "In another email sent Jan. 31, 2024, the case worker said Lakanwal had \"not been functional as a person, father and provider since March of last year, 03/2023.\"",
      "\"He spends most of his time for weeks on end in his darkened bedroom, not speaking to anyone, not even his wife and older kids,\" the email said.",
      "The email also describes \"manic episodes for one or two weeks at a time where he will take off in the family car,\" but also \"interim\" periods where he \"tries to make amends.\" The case worker, who is not a mental health professional, later said in the email that they believed Lakanwal is suffering \"\u2026PTSD from his work with the US military in Afghanistan.\"",
      "According to a former Afghan commando who spoke with CBS News, Lakanwal led a unit of Afghan special forces in the south of the country and worked closely with the international troops before the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The former commando also said that Lakanwal was left deeply troubled by the death of a close friend and fellow Afghan commander in 2024, whom the former commando said had unsuccessfully sought asylum in the U.S.",
      "Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024, which is a lawful immigration process overseen by the Department of Homeland Security. As part of that process, he would have gone through extensive vetting \u2014 including background checks, social media reviews, and in-person interviews. He had multiple, in-person asylum meetings at a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in 2024, the case worker said.",
      "He passed his reviews and was eventually granted asylum in April 2025.",
      "The case worker told CBS News that neither DHS nor USCIS ever reached out about the emails, and said they don't believe the government ever saw the emails or considered them in his asylum process.",
      "\"Rahmanulla was a man who was extremely proud and capable in the world he came from, who felt defeated in the world he came to,\" the case worker said.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that Lakanwal, who is facing murder charges, was \"radicalized since he's been here in this country.\"",
      "\"We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him,\" Noem said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" She provided no further details.",
      "\"This violent act does not reflect the Afghan community, which continues to contribute across the United States and undergoes some of the most extensive vetting of any immigrant population,\" said Shawn VanDiver, president of AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for the resettlement of Afghans who worked with the U.S. military.",
      "Lakanwal was shot by another National Guard member during his attack and is also hospitalized. He has been sedated and placed on a ventilator since the shooting, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. The treatment has complicated investigators' efforts to interview him.",
      "As part of the investigation, U.S. intelligence analysts are combing Lakanwal's communications and online footprint for signs of international coordination or ideological radicalization, multiple U.S. officials said. An early review of his social media and messaging channels has not revealed links to foreign handlers or extremist groups.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-friday-cyber-monday-2025-spending-deals-inflation/",
    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 12:55:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Holiday spending is hitting new records, but some data shows that people are buying fewer items amid higher prices.",
    "story": [
      "Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts.",
      "Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier,\u00a0according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago.",
      "The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market.",
      "Inflation remains a problem",
      "Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said.",
      "\"A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth.\"",
      "He added, \"This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did.\"",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April.",
      "Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few \"big ticket\" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck.",
      "Affordability pinch",
      "Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers.",
      "Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays.",
      "Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Spending among the bottom 80% of households \u2014 or those earning less than $175,000 a year \u2014 has \"simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic,\" Zandi wrote in a September social media post.",
      "That's creating a so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs.",
      "It's not yet clear from Black Friday and Cyber Monday spending whether the K-shaped trend influenced this year's record holiday sales, but both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted.",
      "\"So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well,\" he said. \"Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too.\"",

Bitcoin has lost roughly a third of its value since Oct. 6, when it hit a record high of nearly $125,000.

      "Experts who spoke to CBS News said global economic developments are weighing on the crypto sector. Bitcoin prices sank after a Bank of Japan official hinted at a possible interest rate hike at its upcoming meeting on Dec. 18-19.

    "summary": "A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court decision that disqualified Alina Habba as acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court decision that disqualified Alina Habba, who served as a personal lawyer to President Trump, as the acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit was unanimous against the Trump administration, which has attempted to use a novel mechanism to place lawyers who have not received Senate approval into temporary U.S. attorney positions across the country.",
      "The case before the 3rd Circuit arose after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey challenged the validity of Habba's appointment as a violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and sought to have their indictments dismissed.",
      "U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled in August that Habba has been serving without lawful authority since the beginning of July, when she was tapped to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey. Brann said she must be disqualified from participating in ongoing cases.",
      "The Justice Department appealed that decision to the 3rd Circuit, which is now the first federal appeals court to weigh in on the administration's scheme for installing certain U.S. attorneys.",
      "\"The court's decision affirms that U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is unlawfully and invalidly serving as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey, marking the first time an appellate court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions,\" lawyers Abbe Lowell, Gerry Krovatin and Norm Eisen said in a joint statement. \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. attorneys wherever appropriate.\"",
      "Lowell argued before the 3rd Circuit, and Krovatin represents one of the defendants.",
      "Thomas Mirigliano, a lawyer who represented a second defendant, said \"the panel issued a clear and carefully reasoned decision that recognizes the extraordinary power vested in U.S. attorneys and reinforces the limits Congress has set on who may occupy those positions. We appreciate the Court's thoughtful approach and the clarity it brings to this important issue.\"",
      "Neither Habba nor the Justice Department immediately responded to requests for comment.",
      "Habba was tapped to serve as interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey earlier this year, but her appointment to the role was limited to 120 days, unless the U.S. district court in New Jersey voted to extend her tenure or she was confirmed to the post by the Senate. Habba's nomination, however, was unlikely to win approval in the upper chamber, as New Jersey's two senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed her nomination.",
      "Ahead of the 120-day deadline, the judges in New Jersey declined to allow Habba to continue serving as U.S. attorney and instead voted to install her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the position. But that decision was met with swift pushback from Attorney General Pam Bondi, who fired Grace.",
      "Then, Mr. Trump and top administration officials employed a multi-step maneuver to keep Habba in the role of U.S. attorney and get around the district court's decision. First, the president withdrew Habba's nomination for U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Then, Habba resigned as interim U.S. attorney. Bondi then appointed Habba as \"special attorney\" and to fill Grace's role as first assistant U.S. attorney. Finally, because the position as the New Jersey's top prosecutor was vacant, Habba was elevated to the role of acting U.S. attorney under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
      "That law, also known as the Vacancies Act, limits the government employees who can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.",
      "In their decision, the judges on the 3rd Circuit found that the Trump administration's argument in support of Habba's role \"should raise a red flag,\" since it would allow the Justice Department to circumvent the Vacancies Act and effectively allow anyone to hold a U.S. attorney position indefinitely.",
      "\"Under the Government's delegation theory, Habba may avoid the gauntlet of presidential appointment and Senate confirmation and serve as the de facto U.S. Attorney indefinitely,\" Judge Michael Fisher wrote for the court. \"This view is so broad that it bypasses the constitutional [presidential appointment and Senate confirmation] process entirely. It also essentially eliminates the requirements of the FVRA and the U.S. Attorney-specific statute.\"",
      "Fisher was selected for the 3rd Circuit by President George W. Bush. He was joined in the decision by Judge L. Felipe Restrepo, appointed by President Barack Obama, and Judge D. Brooks Smith, tapped for the 3rd Circuit by Bush.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to install temporary U.S. attorneys in Nevada and Los Angeles using the mechanism it employed for Habba, but has faced resistance from the courts. The most high-profile of those decisions came last week, when a federal judge ordered the criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured their indictments, was unlawfully appointed to the role.",

      "U.S. military jets on Saturday intercepted a civilian aircraft that flew through temporarily restricted airspace over Palm Beach, Florida, where President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate is located,\u00a0according to the North American Aerospace Defense Command.",
      "The civilian plane entered the airspace at around 4:20 p.m. EST that afternoon, NORAD said. It dispatched F-16 fighter jets to the site, which initially sent out flares to get the pilot's attention before escorting the plane out of the restricted zone.",
      "\"The flares, which may have been visible to the public, are used with the highest regard for safety, burn out quickly and completely, and pose no danger to people on the ground,\" said NORAD. The command is a joint U.S. and Canadian organization that handles aerospace and maritime warnings for North America.",
      "Pilots, @NORADCommand fighters intercepted an aircraft violating restricted airspace over Palm Beach, FL, resulting in flares being deployed. Check NOTAMs before EVERY flight!https://t.co/LBjYKCWNYx@flywithaopa",
      "NORAD reminded general aviation pilots to check \"Notices to Airmen,\" or NOTAMS, which are timely advisories that notify pilots of any changes to the national airspace, including temporary flight restrictions, ahead of each flight. Temporary flight restrictions prohibit aircraft from entering certain airspaces for designated periods of time.",
      "The command said military jets \"will respond to aircraft violating the [Temporary Flight Restriction and take the necessary action to gain compliance, a scenario we encourage all pilots to avoid.\"",
      "The interception on Saturday followed \"multiple general aviation aircraft violations of restricted airspace\" over Palm Beach earlier in the week, according to NORAD, which said the command has responded to more than 40 \"tracks of interest\" that violated temporary flight restrictions in the West Palm Beach area since President Trump took office in January.",
      "Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate is located in Palm Beach, and his golf club is in West Palm. The president was at Mar-a-Lago over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.",
      "A \"track of interest\" typically refers to any airborne object that either threatens or has the potential to threaten North America or U.S. national security, and is monitored as such, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Less than two months after Mr. Trump began his second presidential term, in early March, NORAD said military jets had already intercepted 20 civilian aircraft violating temporary flight restrictions near his Palm Beach home.",
      "Back in 2017, during Mr. Trump's first term, a pair of F-15 fighter jets were scrambled to intercept an unresponsive aircraft near Mar-a-Lago.

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 08:56:34 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump and more than a dozen of his allies were charged with offenses in Georgia relating to the 2020 presidential election.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Georgia judge on Wednesday agreed to dismiss the state's case against President Trump and his allies stemming from the 2020 presidential election after the local prosecutor who took over the case said he would no longer pursue the charges \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.\"",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee issued a brief order dismissing the case \"in its entirety\" shortly after Peter Skandalakis, who stepped in to replace Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis after she was disqualified from the case, filed a motion informing the court of his decision to abandon the prosecution of Mr. Trump and more than a dozen others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.",
      "Skandalakis wrote in a memo accompanying the notice that overt acts listed in the indictment that were taken by the president and other Republicans \"are not acts I would consider sufficient\" to sustain a racketeering case. Skandalakis said that after reviewing the evidence, he concluded that a federal prosecution was more appropriate than one pursued by the state of Georgia, and said the \"strongest and most prosecutable case\" against those who allegedly sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election was the one being pursued by former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The president was charged with four federal counts stemming from an alleged effort to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, but Smith dropped the case after Mr. Trump won a second term in the White House.",
      "Steve Sadow, Mr. Trump's lawyer in the Georgia case, said in response to Skandalakis' motion, \"The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over. This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called the prosecution an \"illegal, unconstitutional and unAmerican hoax.\"",
      "\"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed in the Great State of Georgia,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "A spokesperson for Giuliani cheered the decision.",
      "\"The decision to dismiss all criminal charges against Mayor Rudy Giuliani is long overdue and represents a complete repudiation of the demonstrably false claims that partisan actors used to justify his improper disbarment,\" Ted Goodman, Giuliani's spokesperson, said in a statement. \"The integrity of our justice system cannot be fully restored until Mayor Giuliani's law license is reinstated and the hundreds of other victims of the political weaponization against President Trump and his supporters receive the justice they deserve.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and 18 of his associates were indicted by a Fulton County grand jury in August 2023 under Georgia's racketeering law and were accused of coordinating a scheme to thwart certification of the 2020 election results in the state. The indictment capped an extraordinary and historic five months, across which the president was charged in four separate cases involving allegations of conduct that bookended his first term in office. Mr. Trump was the first former president to be charged with a crime.",
      "Two of those cases were brought by Smith and involved federal offenses, and a third was brought by the Manhattan District Attorney and stemmed from an alleged \"hush money\" payment to an adult film actress before the 2016 election. Smith ended his prosecutions of the president \u2014 one related to the 2020 election and the other involving his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after leaving office in January 2021 \u2014 after he won a second term.",
      "In the New York case, Mr. Trump was found guilty of 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records in June 2024 and has appealed the conviction.",
      "Mr. Trump was initially charged with 13 felony counts in Georgia, but several have been dismissed in the years since the indictment. He pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. Four of the president's 18 co-defendants accepted plea deals from prosecutors.",
      "The prosecution in Fulton County moved the slowest of the criminal cases involving the president, and proceedings were derailed for months by the bombshell revelation that Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as a special prosecutor to assist in the investigation into Mr. Trump and his allies.",
      "The two acknowledged the relationship but said it didn't begin until months after Wade was hired in November 2021.",
      "The trial court judge overseeing the case, Scott McAfee, held a multi-day hearing to examine whether Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because of her relationship with Wade and travels with him, during which both prosecutors testified.",
      "McAfee ultimately declined to disqualify Willis from the case but said Wade had to step aside, which he did. But Mr. Trump and a group of his co-defendants appealed the ruling.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals reversed McAfee's decision in December and said disqualification of Willis was the only remedy to restore public confidence in the integrity of the proceedings. The Georgia Supreme Court turned away Willis' appeal\u00a0in September, leaving the ruling mandating her removal from the case against Mr. Trump intact.",
      "The Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia, which of Skandalakis is the executive director, was tasked with finding a replacement to take over the case from Willis. He announced earlier this month that he would helm the prosecution himself after several others contacted declined to do so.",

      "The defense argues certain evidence should not be allowed during trial, so the judge has scheduled a series of suppression hearings, which are expected to last several days, possibly a week.",
      "The evidence that Mangione's defense wants to suppress at trial",
      "Mangione's defense attorneys argue statements he made to law enforcement should be suppressed because they claim officers failed to provide Miranda warnings, which is when a suspect is informed of their constitutional rights.",
      "The defense also argues evidence seized at the time of his arrest at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, shouldn't be allowed because they claim law enforcement did a warrantless search of his backpack after he was handcuffed and surrounded by officers.",
      "Among the items inside the backpack were a gun with a 3D printed receiver, ammunition and a red notebook he allegedly used as his diary. One of the entries reads in part, \"The target is insurance. It checks every box.\"",
      "There was also a note to the FBI that read in part, \"Frankly, these parasites had it coming.\"",
      "\"The prosecution argues that there was good reason to search the bag immediately because they had to find out if there was anything dangerous in the bag,\" explained legal analyst Rich Schoenstein. \"If you've just arrested somebody who you think has shot a man in the back in the middle of the street, you might be worried about what else is in that bag, and indeed there was a weapon in that bag, so I think the prosecution has the stronger argument here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Travelers around the United States faced delays at major airports during the busy holiday weekend, as winter weather disrupted airlines' schedules and software issues temporarily grounded a popular plane model in the days after Thanksgiving.",
      "There were 12,113 inbound and outbound flight delays reported across the U.S. on Sunday, according to the tracking site FlightAware. The tracker also showed 1,424 flight cancellations. Airports in Chicago, New York City, Boston, Des Moines, Fort Lauderdale and Detroit were among those most affected. There was also at least one rail disruption in Providence, Rhode Island, where a fire broke out beneath three Amtrak train cars with passengers inside. The Providence Fire Department said crews extinguished the fire and relocated the train cars, and no one was injured. CBS News reached out to Amtrak for information about wider delays but did not receive an immediate response.",
      "A powerful snowstorm in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions initially interrupted air travel for some in the wake of last week's holiday. National Weather Service offices issued a flurry of winter storm warnings and advisories from Montana to Ohio as a result, and forecasters cautioned that airport delays and slow-moving traffic would likely follow. That was especially true for places where snowfall was expected to accumulate at rates of more than one inch per hour.",
      "The storm at first dropped upwards of 8 inches of snow on northern Iowa, the National Weather Service said. By Saturday night, more than 1,400 flights were canceled at airports in Chicago, where the winter storm was expected to bring as much as 10 inches of snow, CBS Chicago reported.",
      "Similar accumulation was forecast in other parts of Illinois as well as in Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Airports in Detroit faced more than 300 flight delays and dozens of cancellations as the storm moved over that area Saturday night, CBS Detroit reported.",

    "summary": "Juan Orlando Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of Honduras.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday that he will be pardoning former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who in 2024 was convicted in New York for drug trafficking and weapons charges and sentenced to 45 years in prison.",
      "The president explained his decision on social media by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "The idea drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hernandez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hern\u00e1ndez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hern\u00e1ndez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "A lawyer for Hernandez, Renato C. Stabile, expressed gratitude for Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"A great injustice has been righted and we are so hopeful for the future partnership of the United States and Honduras,\" Stabile said. \"Thank you President Trump for making sure that justice was served. We look forward to President Hernandez's triumphant return to Honduras.\"",
      "A separate lawyer for Hernandez, Sabrina Shroff, declined comment.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "\"This is shocking,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia, said of the pardon on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"He was convicted in a federal court in the United States,\" said Kaine, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \"One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine, more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House.\"",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",
      "Shortly after Trump announced his intention to pardon the ex-president, Hern\u00e1ndez's wife Ana Garc\u00eda and their adult children gathered on the steps of their home in Tegucigalpa.",
      "Garc\u00eda thanked Trump, saying that Trump had corrected an injustice, maintaining that Hern\u00e1ndez's prosecution was a coordinated plot by drug traffickers and the \"radical left\" to seek revenge against the former president.",
      "Mr. Trump's post on Friday was part of a broader message by the U.S. president backing Tito Asfura for Honduras' presidency, with Mr. Trump saying the U.S. would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Trump posted that \"the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.\"",
      "Asfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He was mayor of Tegucigalpa and has pledged to solve Honduras' infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies.",
      "In addition to Asfura, there are two other likely contenders for Honduras' presidency: Rixi Moncada, who served as the finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president for the incumbent democratic socialist Libre party, and Salvador Nasralla, a former television personality who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party.",
      "Mr. Trump has framed Honduras' election as trial for democracy, suggesting in a separate Truth Social post that if Asfura loses, the country could go the way of Venezuela and fall under the influence of that country's leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to apply pressure on Maduro, who the Trump administration has accused of leading a drug cartel, ordering a series of strikes against boats suspected of carrying drugs, building up the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean with warships, including the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford.",
      "The U.S. president has not ruled out taking military action or covert action by the CIA against Venezuela, though he has also floated that he was open to speaking with Maduro.",
      "Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the U.S. administration and she has received visits from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, when she was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras' extradition treaty and military cooperation with the U.S.",
      "Under Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the U.S. and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras.",

      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Sunday that a reported U.S. follow-on strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.\"",
      "\"If that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DoD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The Washington Post reported Friday that in the U.S.' first strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors. A follow-on strike was ordered to comply with the instructions, killing two survivors in the water, the Post reported. Hegseth called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" claiming the operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law.\"",
      "CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",
      "Targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are wounded is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions, which also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\" A group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. And the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees pledged to investigate the reported follow-on strike.",
      "Asked about the reported follow-on strike while aboard Air Force One on Sunday, President Trump said, \"First of all, I don't know that that happened, and Pete [Hegseth] said he didn't even know what people were talking about.\"",
      "\"So, we'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that, a second strike,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The first strike was very lethal. It was fine. If there were two people around \u2014 but Pete [Hegseth] said that didn't happen. I have great confidence in him ... I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he didn't order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out close to two dozen boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean. Kaine outlined to CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that lawmakers have been seeking answers to a number of questions about the strikes, including seeking evidence that \"the folks on board were really narco traffickers,\" the question of why to strike rather than interdict, and the legal rationale for the strikes.",
      "\"We had to pry with a crowbar after weeks and weeks out of the administration, the supposed legal rationale for the strikes at international waters,\" Kaine said. \"It was very shoddy.\"",
      "The Virginia Democrat said, \"It's time for Congress to rein in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say-so, which is not what the Constitution allowed.\"",
      "Kaine has twice tried to pass war powers resolutions aimed at preventing the president from conducting strikes against Venezuela, earning support from two Republicans.",
      "\"That was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela, and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed,\" Kaine said.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday that Venezuela's airspace should be considered \"CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\" The post comes as the administration has increased pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, with signs that military action, including possible ground action, could be imminent.",

    "summary": "The team of Ukrainian negotiators began meeting Sunday morning with Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio expressed concern Sunday that the White House-backed proposed plan to end the war in Ukraine is too pro-Russia, while urging that any peace arrangement must look at Russia as a \"skeptical adversary.\"",
      "Turner said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the president's \"goal of peace is incredibly important,\" while acknowledging comments made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio's supporting a sovereign Ukraine as negotiators gathered in Miami on Sunday morning.",
      "The team of Ukrainian negotiators began meeting Sunday morning with Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law. Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow later this week.",
      "As the meeting kicked off Sunday, Rubio outlined that \"the end goal is obviously not just the end of the war,\" but also \"securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.\"",
      "Rubio's comments come after the White House floated a peace proposal earlier this month that critics said favored Russia, initially including several provisions that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had rejected in the past. But the plan has since been revised, Mr. Trump has outlined, citing progress on both sides.",
      "Asked by CBS' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes whether he still has concerns about the plan being too pro-Russia, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and formerly chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said \"I think we all have those concerns.\" But he added, \"one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have, you can't be America First and pro-Russia, because Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States.\"",
      "\"It's fielding new, advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States, it's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber, it continuously identifies both NATO and the west, the United States, as its adversary,\" Turner said. \"You have to understand that the balance of this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.\"",
      "Asked about a transcript of a call published by Bloomberg in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching a Kremlin aide on how to negotiate with President Trump, Turner said \"the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelenskyy was on his way to the White House.\"",
      "Turner said \"this is not a military against military action, they are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine.\"",
      "\"The Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian, murderous Putin,\" Turner added.",
      "As for Witkoff, Turner said \"I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during the long, stretched out aspects of negotiations as reflective. But I think it's certainly important that when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern.\"",
      "\"The orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy's is very concerning,\" Turner said. \"Because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent. And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.\"",
      "On Sunday afternoon, Rubio called the day's meeting \"another very productive session,\" reiterating the intention to end the war while also working to \"help Ukraine be safe forever.\" He called it a \"shared vision.\"",
      "\"But there's more work to be done,\" Rubio said after the meeting. \"This is delicate, it's complicated, there are a lot of moving parts, and obviously there's another party involved here that will have to be a part of the equation, and that will continue later this week when Mr. Witkoff travels to Moscow.\"",

    "summary": "The \"Zero Units\" were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among Afghanistan's most trusted domestic forces.",
    "story": [
      "An image of an ID badge circulating widely online that shows the suspect in the shooting of the National Guard members says he was assigned to the \"Kandahar Strike Force\" or \"03\" unit, one of a number of so-called \"Zero Units\" that worked closely with U.S. and other foreign forces during the war in Afghanistan. A former senior Afghan military source confirmed to CBS News that the ID badge is authentic.",
      "A U.S. official briefed on the shooting investigation and a former senior Afghan National Defense and Security Forces member told CBS News that the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had been part of a \"Zero Unit,\" an Afghan intelligence unit and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA. The units were exclusively composed of\u00a0Afghan nationals\u00a0and operated under the umbrella of the National Directorate of Security, or NDS, the intelligence agency established with CIA backing for Afghanistan's previous, U.S.-backed government. They were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among the most trusted domestic forces in Afghanistan.",
      "Those units are often labeled \"death squads\" by human rights groups. The units were known in Afghanistan for their secrecy and alleged brutality, and members were implicated in numerous extrajudicial killings of civilians, particularly during night raids.",
      "The U.S. official briefed on the investigation confirmed the suspect had been disturbed by the casualties in this unit and, more recently, deeply troubled by the killing of his close friend overseas.",
      "The image of the ID badge also carries the words \"Firebase Gecko,\" which was the name of a base used by the CIA and special forces in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, inside what was previously the compound of the Taliban's founding leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Thursday the suspect had previously worked \"with the U.S. Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.\"",
      "Lt. Gen. Sami Sadat, a former commanding general of the Afghan National Special Operations Corps, told CBS News that Lakanwal worked for the \"03\" unit for eight years. A former senior Afghan general under the U.S.-backed government told CBS News on Thursday that \"03 unit, also known as The Kandahar Strike Force (KSF), was under special forces directorate of NDS. They were the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA. All their operations were conducted under the CIA command.\" Lakanwal was part of the unit's operations team, Sadat said.",
      "\"He was known for being responsible and professional within his team and had strong anti-Taliban views,\" Sadat said.",
      "\"While we could not establish any connection between him and any terrorist organization, we also cannot completely rule it out,\" Sadat said. \"However, we can confirm that his background does not show any links to terrorists.\"",
      "Lakanwal's family faced serious threats from the Taliban, which led him to relocate them from their native Khost province to Kabul, Sadat said. In the U.S., Sadat said Lakanwal was \"generally calm and maintained a clean record, though he suffered from PTSD.\"",
      "As a member of a Zero Unit, the suspect would have been virtually guaranteed a route to asylum in the U.S. because members of these elite units were high on the list for\u00a0Taliban retaliation\u00a0after the group retook control of the country. Many members of these units played key roles in the August 2021\u00a0evacuation from Kabul, in return for a guarantee of space on a flight for themselves and their families out of Afghanistan.",
      "Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under the Obama administration, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that Afghan evacuees were thoroughly vetted prior to arriving in the U.S. after its withdrawal.",
      "In Lakanwal's case, the suspect would have been vetted by the CIA prior to joining the Zero Unit, Vinograd said, before referencing comments from national security leaders that suggested he became radicalized after coming to the U.S.",
      "\"This horrific tragedy could be the result of an individual that quickly mobilized to violence without any ties to foreign terrorism,\" said Vinograd. \"And, as we have discussed in other cases, trying to find lone actors before they initiate an attack is harder than trying to find a needle in a haystack.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Afghanistan's current Taliban government, and officials in Kabul did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment on the arrest in Washington.",

    "summary": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the commander of a September operation \"worked well within his authority and the law\" when ordering a follow-on strike.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House on Monday said that a U.S. attack on an alleged drug boat in September included more than one strike on the vessel, seemingly confirming a Washington Post report that the U.S. targeted the boat for a second time to take out survivors of the initial attack.",
      "The Post reported on Friday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors before the U.S. attack on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the first strike left two men alive in the water. The paper said the commander of the operation, Adm. Frank Bradley, ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the two. CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",
      "The report sparked calls for an investigation by lawmakers of both parties in Congress, some of whom raised the prospect that targeting the survivors could constitute a war crime. Hegseth has called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" claiming the operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the Post's report during the White House briefing on Monday. \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\" a reporter asked.",
      "\"The latter is true,\" Leavitt replied, before reading out a written statement. \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "President Trump said Sunday that he \"wouldn't have wanted\" the second strike but defended Hegseth's handling of the incident, saying the secretary told him he did not order the subsequent attack.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One, saying he has \"great confidence\" in Hegseth.",
      "He added: \"I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "A group of former military lawyers argued in an assessment on Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. In Congress, the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees pledged to investigate the matter. And Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that the strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" while GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio agreed that it \"would be an illegal act\" if true.",
      "The developments come as the U.S. has carried out close to two dozen boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean since the first attack on Sept. 2.",
      "Asked by CBS News if he has concerns about the boat strikes more broadly, Mr. Trump said Sunday: \"Very little, because you can see the boats, you can see the drugs in the boats and each boat is responsible for killing 25,000 Americans.\"",
      "\"The amount of drugs coming into our country by sea is infinitesimal compared to what it was just a few months ago,\" the president said.",

The U.S. military has killed at least 80 people in boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific in \"Operation Southern Spear,\" which it says is targeting narco-terrorists.",

      "The municipal government of the coastal city of Joao Pessoa said a young man \u2014 identified by Brazilian media as Gerson de Melo Machado, 19 \u2014 had \"deliberately invaded the lioness's enclosure\" at the Arruda Camara Zoobotanical Park.",
      "\"In a rapid and surprising manner, he climbed a wall over six meters high, scaled the security bars, accessed one of the trees, and entered the enclosure,\" the government said in a statement.",

      "She said his mother and grandparents suffered from schizophrenia, but state psychiatrists said he merely \"had a behavioral problem.\"",
      "\"He should have been in treatment,\" she said.",
      "In other media interviews, Oliveira said Machado had dreamed of being a lion tamer, and once cut through an airport fence and hid in the landing gear of a plane he thought was going to Africa.",

      "\"I was so nervous. I immediately got my clothes, phone and went downstairs,\" he said.",
      "He never imagined that the blaze at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong would spread so quickly. It tore through bamboo scaffolding, mesh netting covering it, and then foam window coverings that had adorned the sprawling complex's eight buildings for ongoing renovation work.",
      "\"I got outside and saw a big fire,\" he told CBS News on Monday, as the official death toll from the blaze climbed to over 150. \"Fire was spreading everywhere, and I could hear the bamboo exploding. The fire spread to the other block. The mesh caught alight.\"",
      "That other block was his own building, where he knew his wife was still upstairs. He watched as the blaze spread up the sides, quickly blocking the main lobby.",
      "\"I called my wife immediately and said there's a big fire and we have to go now,\" the 67-year-old recalled through tears. \"I told my wife, don't come down.\"",
      "He had hoped that firefighters would be able to get the blaze under control before it was too late.",
      "On the other end of the phone, his distraught wife, Bai Shui Lin, told him she couldn't move through the thick smoke.",
      "\"Then there was so much noise,\" he said. \"I can't hear her anymore \u2026 only noise. And then I can't contact her anymore. That's the last call I had with her.\"",
      "\"I kept waiting, hoping the fire would be put out. I thought maybe only the outside would be affected. But the fire just kept getting bigger,\" he said.",
      "As the blaze spread to seven of the buildings on the complex, Yip watched from behind a police cordon for any sign of his wife being carried out, but he never saw her.",
      "He said he pored over lists of photos and names of victims for days as the death toll mounted, giving her description to nearby hospitals in the hope that she had been rescued.",
      "\"I couldn't find my wife,\" he said through tears. \"I tried everything.\"",
      "Five days later, police confirmed his worst fears in a phone call on Monday. Bai, his wife of 40 years, never made it out of their building.",
      "The couple's two sons had to confirm her identification, but her remains were burned so badly that authorities used an ID card found in her purse to verify it was her.",
      "Yip said she had gone door to door, warning neighbors of the fire that had spread to their building. He said she helped at least three other families make it out before it was too late.",
      "Both of their sons survived the catastrophic fire, but Yip said he was struggling with guilt over the loss of his wife.",

    "story": [
      "The World Health Organization issued new guidelines Monday recommending the use of GLP-1 drugs for treating obesity.",
      "In the\u00a0new guidelines, the United Nations health agency made two key recommendations \u2014 first, that GLP-1 therapies may be used by adults for long-term treatment of obesity, except for pregnant women. It also recommended intensive behavioral therapy, including changes related to diet and exercise, alongside the use of the medications.",
      "\"Obesity is a major global health challenge that WHO is committed to addressing by supporting countries and people worldwide to control it, effectively and equitably. Our new guidance recognizes that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care,\" Dr. Tedros Adhanom\u00a0 Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said in a news release. \"While medication alone won't solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms.\"",
      "Both recommendations, however, are considered \"conditional.\" WHO noted that the first recommendation is considered \"conditional\" due to limited data on the medications' long-term efficacy and safety, as well as costs and other factors. The second recommendation was graded \"conditional\" based on \"low-certainty evidence\" that intensive behavioral therapy enhances GLP-1  treatment outcomes.",
      "Still, the organization calls the drugs \"more than a scientific breakthrough.\"",
      "\"They represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity-from a 'lifestyle condition' to a complex, preventable, and treatable chronic disease,\" says an article published online Monday in the peer-reviewed medical journal  JAMA. The article was co-written by Francesca Celletti, who is senior advisor for obesity at WHO's Nutrition and Food Safety department.",
      "The World Health Organization highlighted the importance of equitable access to GLP-1 drugs, saying that it is calling for \"urgent action on manufacturing, affordability, and system readiness to meet global needs.\"",
      "\"Even with rapid expansion in production, GLP-1 therapies are projected to reach fewer than 10% of those who could benefit by 2030,\" WHO says.",
      "Well-known brand names of GLP-1 drugs in the U.S. include Ozempic and Mounjaro, which are FDA approved for treating diabetes, and Wegovy and Zepbound, which are approved for weight loss.",
      "WHO estimates that obesity affects more than 1 billion people globally and was associated with 3.7 million deaths last year. It also notes that in September, it added GLP-1 therapies to its \"Essential Medicines List\" for managing type 2 diabetes in groups that are high-risk.",
      "\"With the new guideline, WHO issues conditional recommendations for using these therapies to support people living with obesity in overcoming this serious health challenge, as part of a comprehensive approach that includes healthy diets, regular physical activity and support from health professionals,\" the agency said in its news release Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 As the confirmed death toll from the Hong Kong apartment complex fire climbed to at least 151 on Monday, officials said their investigation into the blaze had found that mesh used to cover scaffolding for ongoing renovations was not up to fire-safety codes.",
      "Frustration over what appears to have been clear safety lapses ahead of the devastating fire \u2014   which took more than two days to extinguish as it engulfed seven of the complex's eight towers \u2014 was being met with government moves to stifle criticism.",
      "Initial tests of the netting that had enshrouded the scaffolding showed it met safety regulations, but Hong Kong officials said Monday that investigators had since gained access to more areas to collect samples, including from higher floors.",
      "Hong Kong Chief Secretary Eric Chan said seven of the 20 new samples of the synthetic mesh had failed fire safety standards, suggesting contractors may have opted for cost-saving over the safety of residents and workers.",
      "\"They just wanted to make money at the expense of people's lives,\" Chan told reporters.",
      "Recovery teams found another eight bodies, including those of three firefighters located earlier but which workers had been unable to retrieve, Tsang Shuk-yin, head of the Hong Kong police's casualty enquiry unit told reporters on Monday. She said more than 30 people were still listed as missing, but some were likely among the nearly 40 sets of remains recovered but yet to be identified.",
      "\"We will have to wait until we get through all seven blocks before we can make a final report,\" she said, adding that some remains were likely so badly burned that identification could prove impossible.",
      "About 4,600 people lived in the eight buildings of the Wang Fuk Court complex, which is in the Hong Kong suburb of Tai Po, not far from the border with mainland China.",
      "Monday was to be the last day of an official mourning period declared by authorities, and thousands of people turned out to pay their respects, laying flowers, toys and notes for the victims, many of whom where children and the elderly.",
      "Police have released photos from inside the charred buildings, where they found the bodies of residents who had tried to escape the inferno in stairwells and on rooftops.",
      "One deeply distraught man at the scene on Monday told CBS News that his sons had just identified the remains of his 66-year-old wife, who died in the fire. He said he was demanding answers from the government as to how the disaster could have happened.",
      "Anger has mounted in Hong Kong since the fire erupted on Wednesday morning last week. It had already been revealed that the fire alarms were turned off in the complex, and for months, residents had issued warnings about what they believed to be hazardous materials covering the buildings during the renovation.",
      "As of Monday, 14 people had been arrested for suspected manslaughter, and authorities were not ruling out further arrests.",
      "The level of public angst has rattled Beijing, to the extent that the central government issued a warning to Hong Kongers against any protests or using the fire to \"disrupt\" life in the city.",
      "The warning drew parallels to the crackdown on pro-democracy protests that paralyzed the city in 2019.",
      "Three people had been arrested on Monday under a sweeping national security law imposed in the wake of those protests. Their lawyer says they were detained for starting a petition calling for an independent inquiry into the fire \u2014   a sign of how concerned Beijing is that the tragedy could lead to fresh civil unrest in the previously semi-autonomous southern metropolis.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 09:15:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Even if you don't know the meaning of the Oxford University Press' word of the year for 2025, you've probably been a victim of it on social media.",
    "story": [
      "Even if you don't know the meaning of the Oxford University Press' word of the year for 2025, you've probably been a victim of it on social media.",
      "The publisher for the Oxford English Dictionary said on Monday it chose \"rage bait\" as its top word for the year, capturing the internet zeitgeist of 2025.",
      "The word of the year is selected by lexicographers at Oxford University Press who analyze new and emerging words, as well as changes in the way language is being used, to identify words of \"cultural significance.\"",
      "What is \"rage bait\"?",
      "The phrase refers to online content that is \"deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative or offensive,\" to drive traffic to a particular social media account, Oxford said in a statement.",
      "\"The person producing it will bask in the millions, quite often, of comments and shares and even likes sometimes,'' lexicographer Susie Dent told CBS News partner BBC. This is a result of the algorithms used by social media companies, \"because although we love fluffy cats, we'll appreciate that we tend to engage more with negative content and content that really provokes us.\"",
      "It is similar to clickbait, where a headline is used to lure a reader into viewing an article or a video, but rage bait content's specific focus is on making people angry.",
      "\"The fact that the word 'rage bait' exists and has seen such a dramatic surge in usage means we're increasingly aware of the manipulation tactics we can be drawn into online,\" Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, told BBC News. \"Before, the internet was focused on grabbing our attention by sparking curiosity in exchange for clicks, but now we've seen a dramatic shift to it hijacking and influencing our emotions, and how we respond.\"",
      "2025 Word of the Year shortlist",
      "Rage bait topped two other contenders \u2013 \"aura farming\" and \"biohack\" \u2013 after public comment on a shortlist compiled by the publisher's lexicographers.",
      "\"Aura farming'' means to cultivate a public image by presenting oneself in \"a way intended subtly to convey an air of confidence, coolness or mystique.''",
      "\"Biohack'' is defined as \"an attempt to improve or optimize one's physical or mental performance, health or longevity.''",
      "Oxford's past winners",
      "Oxford University Press has selected a word of the year annually since 2004.",
      "Past winners include \"podcast\" in 2005, \"emoji\" in 2015, and in 2022, \"goblin mode,\" which described people who resisted returning to normal life after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Last year's word, brain rot, captured the mental drain of mindless scrolling on Instagram or TikTok.",
      "Cambridge Dictionary declared \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year, defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",
      "Dictionary.com named \"67\"\u00a0as its 2025 word of the year.",

    "story": [
      "A long-lost painting by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens, which was hidden for more than four centuries, sold for $2.7 million at an auction Sunday in Versailles.",
      "The painting was recently found in a private townhouse in Paris. It depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.",
      "It was part of a French collection and was initially thought to be from one of the many Rubens workshops that existed at the time. The artwork was rarely valued at more than $11,500.",
      "\"I immediately had a hunch about this painting, and I did everything I could to try to have it authenticated,\" auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told The Associated Press. \"And finally, we managed to have it authenticated by the Rubenianum, which is the Rubens committee in Antwerp.\"",
      "Osenat told AFP earlier this year the picture was \"a masterpiece\" which was painted by Rubens when he was \"at the height of his talent.\"",
      "The painting was authenticated by German art historian Nils Buttner, known for his research on the master of the Flemish Baroque, Osenat said. Its provenance was certified through methods including X-ray imaging and pigment analysis, he added.",
      "B\u00fcttner explained before the auction that the master often painted crucifixions but rarely depicted \"the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross.\"",
      "\"So this is the one and only painting showing blood and water coming out of the side wound of Christ, and this is something that Rubens only painted once.\"",
      "The Osenat auction house said the painting's authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments Rubens typically used in painting human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",
      "Although Rubens produced many works for the Church, the painting, measuring 42 by 29 inches, was likely to have been created for a private collector.",
      "A flurry of paintings by famous artists have sold at auctions in recent days.",
      "Last week, a previously unknown work by French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir of his toddler son Jean sold for $2.08 million at a Paris auction.",
      "Also in November, a self-portrait by celebrated Mexican artist Frida Kahlo\u00a0sold for $54.66 million\u00a0in New York, a record for a painting by a woman. Two nights before that, a Gustav Klimt canvas\u00a0fetched $236.4 million\u00a0\u2014 a record for a modern art piece.",

    "story": [
      "Forest rangers in India have deployed drones to track wolves after nine people, mostly children, were killed by the animals in recent weeks, officials said Sunday.",
      "The latest victim was a 10-month-old girl who was snatched by a wolf in Bahraich district of northern Uttar Pradesh state on Saturday while she was sleeping beside her mother, they said.",
      "The child was later found dead in a field.",
      "A day earlier, a 5-year-old boy was snatched in plain sight of his mother from outside their home.",
      "The child, found mauled in a sugarcane field, died on the way to hospital.",
      "Officials said the attack followed the same pattern seen across a cluster of villages reporting similar incidents since September.",
      "The latest deaths raise the toll from suspected wolf attacks in Bahraich to at least nine in three months, according to police, forest officials and media reports.",
      "The victims also included an elderly couple.",
      "Forest Officer Ram Singh Yadav told AFP on Sunday that authorities have deployed drones, camera traps and shooters in the area.",
      "\"The behavior of wolves seems to have changed. Of late, they are seen active in daytime, which is strange,\" Yadav said.",
      "Other forest officials said the animals appeared unusually bold.",
      "Bahraich saw a similar wave of attacks last year, with a pack of wolves killing at least nine people, including a 1-year-old boy and 3-year-old girl, and injuring several others. At that time, authorities warned people against sleeping out in the open or moving around at night alone, but some houses in the area don't even have doors and many lack indoor toilets, so residents have little option but to go out to relieve themselves in the night.",
      "The grassland plains of Bahraich district lie about 30 miles south of the border with Nepal, where thick forests cover the Himalayan foothills.",
      "Experts say wolves attack humans or livestock only as a last resort when they are starving, preferring less dangerous prey such as small antelopes.",
      "The majority of India's roughly 3,000 wolves survive outside protected areas, often in close proximity to people.",
      "The animals, also known as the plains wolf and listed as vulnerable, are smaller than the stronger Himalayan wolf and can be mistaken for other species such as jackals.",
      "Villagers in Bahraich say they now live in mortal fear of the wolves lurking near their homes.",
      "\"Our children are not safe even inside the house,\" one resident said.",
      "\"We just want the attacks to stop.\"",
      "While attacks by big cats and\u00a0elephants\u00a0are not rare in India, wolf attacks are unusual. More than 300 people were killed in\u00a0tiger attacks\u00a0in the country between 2018 and 2022.",
      "Experts say the expansion of towns and villages into wilderness areas, reducing the natural habitats and hunting grounds of many species, is a major factor behind the increasing people-animal encounters.",

    "summary": "Pope Leo XIV is wrapping up his visit to Turkey before heading to Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV wrapped up his visit to Turkey on Sunday before heading to Lebanon, where he aimed to bring a message of hope to its long-suffering people and bolster a crucial Christian community in the Middle East. He preached similar messages of peace and unity, within his own Catholic community and more broadly, during his earlier stops in Turkey.",
      "Leo had two key appointments in Istanbul before flying to Beirut: a prayer at the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral and a divine liturgy with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, whose invitation to commemorate an important Christian anniversary was the impetus for Leo's visit.",
      "Leo processed into the Armenian cathedral in a cloud of incense as a choir chanted. He praised the \"courageous Christian witness of the Armenian people throughout history, often amid tragic circumstances.\" It was a reference to the World War I-era slaughter of Armenians by Ottoman Turks.",
      "Pope Francis had termed the massacre a \"genocide,\" angering Turkey, which denies a genocide took place. Leo was more diplomatic in his words on Turkish soil.",
      "While in Turkey, the pope also visited Istanbul's\u00a0Blue Mosque, an Ottoman-era historical structure that has become a popular site for tourists.",
      "\"The Pope visited the Mosque in silence, in a spirit of reflection and listening, with profound respect for the place and the faith of those gathered there in prayer,\" said the Holy See's press office in a statement. He was accompanied by Turkish Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, the Provincial Mufti of Istanbul Emrullah Tuncel, and the Grand Imam of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque (the Blue Mosque) Kurra Haf\u0131z Fatih Kaya.",
      "On the second leg of his maiden papal trip, Leo will visit Lebanon at a precarious moment for the small Mediterranean country after years of successive crises. He is fulfilling a promise of Pope Francis, who had wanted to visit for years, but was unable to as his health worsened.",
      "Francis often quoted St. John Paul II, who in 1989 said that Lebanon was more than just a country. It was a \"message\" \u2014 a message of fraternity and coexistence. Under Lebanon's power-sharing system, the country's president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the parliamentary speaker a Shiite.",
      "Lebanon, a Muslim-majority country where about a third of the population is Christian, has always been a priority for the Vatican, a bulwark for Christians throughout the region. After years of conflict, Christian communities that date from the time of the Apostles have shrunk.",
      "Leo was expected to try to encourage Lebanese who believe their leaders have failed them, and to encourage Lebanese Christians to stay or, if they have already moved abroad, to come home.",
      "\"The Holy Father is coming at a very difficult moment for Lebanon and for our region,\" said Bishop George, archbishop of the Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Beirut. Lebanese are worried about the future, he said, and still fear a possible return to all-out war with Israel.",
      "\"In this difficult moment, the pope's visit is a sign of hope. It shows that Lebanon is not forgotten,\" he told reportersbefore the visit.",
      "In 2019, the country's currency and banking system collapsed and many Lebanese saw their savings evaporate. The financial crisis drove shortages of electricity, fuel and medicine.",
      "Another disaster followed in 2020, when hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate improperly stored at the Beirut port detonated in an explosion that blasted through the surrounding neighborhoods, killing 218 people, wounding thousands more and causing billions of dollars in damage.",
      "The highlight of Leo's Lebanese visit will come on his last day, Dec. 2, when he spends time in silent prayer at the site of the blast on Aug. 4, 2020, and meets with some of its victims.",
      "Lebanese citizens were enraged by the blast, which appeared to be the result of government negligence, coming on top of the economic crisis. But an investigation has repeatedly stalled, and five years on, no official has been convicted.",
      "There are hopes among Lebanese that Leo will demand accountability from Lebanon's political class and insist that there can be no peace without truth and justice.",
      "Another important moment will come when Leo meets with young Lebanese. He's expected to give them words of encouragement, amid the decades-long flight abroad, while also acknowledging their disillusionment over the failures of generations before them.",
      "After the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah entered into a low-level conflict with Israel that escalated into a full-fledged war in September 2024, killing more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and causing widespread destruction.",
      "Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that nominally ended the conflict two months later, Israel continues to launch near-daily airstrikes that it says aim to stop Hezbollah from rebuilding.",
      "The pope \"is coming to bless us and for the sake of peace,\" said Farah Saadeh, a Beirut resident walking on the city's seaside promenade. \"We have to wait and see what will happen after he leaves, and we hope nothing is going to happen after his departure.\"",
      "Before Leo's arrival, Hezbollah urged the pope to express his \"rejection to injustice and aggression\" that the country is being subjected to. It was a reference to the Israeli strikes. The group also urged its supporters to line up along the road the papal convoy will take from the airport to the presidential palace to pay their respects.",
      "Hezbollah \u2014 a primarily Shiite group \u2014 has allied with several Christian political groups in the country, including the Free Patriotic Movement and Marada Movement.",
      "However, the Christian party with the largest parliamentary bloc, the Lebanese Forces, is an opponent of Hezbollah and has criticized the group for pulling the country into a war with Israel.",
      "In neighboring Syria, hundreds of thousands of Christians fled during the country's 14 years of civil war.",
      "The country's former autocratic President Bashar Assad was ousted in an offensive led by Islamist insurgents last December. Since then, there have been outbreaks of sectarian violence and some attacks on religious minorities, including a suicide attack on a church in Damascus in June.",
      "While the new government has condemned attacks on minorities, many accuse it of looking the other way or being unable to control allied armed groups.",
      "A delegation of some 300 Syrian Christians, headed by a Greek Melkite Catholic priest, was set to travel to Lebanon to join a meeting between Leo and youth groups and pray in a public mass on Beirut's waterfront.",
      "\"We are in need of someone like the pope to come and give us hope as Christians\" at a time of \"fear of an unknown future,\" said 24-year-old Dima Awwad, one of the delegation members. \"We wish that the pope would come to visit Syria as he visited Lebanon, to reassure the people and to feel that we are present as eastern Christians and that we need to be in this place.\"",

      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the fight against hunger in the United States. According to government data, 47.4 million people lived in what the Department of Agriculture calls a food insecure household in 2023. That's when a household can't necessarily obtain enough food to feed all of its members. One of the largest groups working to combat food insecurity is Feeding America, and we're joined now by CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, who is in Charleston, South Carolina this morning. Claire, thanks so much for being with us, and happy Thanksgiving.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Thanks for having me back.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Absolutely. So during the shutdown, we saw these incredibly long lines at food banks. The shutdown has now been over for a couple of weeks. SNAP benefits are going out again, but even before the shutdown, food insecurity was at its highest rate in nearly a decade. So, what is the situation now that you're seeing at food banks around the country as we head into the holidays?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah. So I'm so glad that you- you made that point. I- I think your viewers may be surprised to learn that food insecurity rates before the shutdown were higher than at any point during the pandemic, as an example. We're continuing to see very high demand. I think part of the reason is because the fastest growing group of people turning to the charitable food system, they're people who don't even qualify for any federal nutrition programs so this is an area that we've got to stay focused on. We know the kinds of things that work. We need to do those things so that we can really address what's happening with hunger and poverty in the country,",
      "NANCY CORDES: What do you think is contributing to the rise in hunger and this group of people who, as you say, don't qualify for benefits, but are showing an increased need for food?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah, I think it's that the system is broken. Right now, there's so many people, if you can imagine, in this country who can't afford to get a raise at work, because we have a system that does not incentivize people to continue to move up the ladder. We've got ladders with big missing rungs, if you will, so we can do something about that. We could have a sliding scale, for instance, that allows people to move out of poverty. By doing that, because food insecurity is actually a symptom of poverty, they'll move out of that as well. We as a nation should all want people to be able to provide for themselves. We should all want them to be able to get work that they can feel proud of and support their families with. We have the power to do all of those things, it will require that we work together, that we be honest about what's broken, and that we really get committed about fixing those things.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What are the main challenges that the organizations in your network are facing this holiday season as they try to feed people who are hungry? Is the food there for the people who need it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: \u00a0Yeah, unfortunately, the lines are longer than- than the food that is available, and one of the hardest things to witness will be seeing these people who have the same dreams, aspirations for their kids and themselves, as I have for mine and all of your viewers have for theirs, feeling the need to turn to the charitable food system. It takes a lot of courage and resiliency and commitment to family ofttimes to be able to do that, and then for them to turn up in spite of all of those barriers, and not- us not be able to provide them with what they really need so I have a deep respect for people experiencing hunger in this country. I've been a person who's experienced hunger before. I know many people who have, many people who still do, so many of them are my heroes. And then another set of heroes that I have are people working in this fight in the Feeding America network, who show up shoulder to shoulder with people experiencing hunger, who are so deeply committed to their well being. So we need to position people experiencing hunger to be able to fend for themselves, and we need to position food banks to be able to provide them with the support that they need in this moment, until they get there.",
      "NANCY CORDES: As you know, there are about two million Americans who are going to be affected by changes to the SNAP program that were made earlier this year in a vote by Congress. They will not be receiving SNAP benefits any longer. What are the economic implications of that? And in about 30 seconds, what can your organizations do about it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: According to the Congressional Budget Office, we're probably looking at about a six billion meal per year gap that's going to be created. So the kinds of things that we ought to do: we ought to address fraud where it exists. We ought to incentivize people to be able to get the hand up that they need and to move out of poverty. We ought to address error rates, but we ought to do all of these things strategically, and we ought to do them in a bipartisan way. This ought to be the kind of thing that this country can come together around, that we can hold hands shoulder to shoulder, because when people experiencing hunger win, we all do.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, we have to leave it there. We've got a hard out. But thank you so much, Claire Babineaux-Fontenot from Feeding America. Thank you so much.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 30, 2025.",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Kevin, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Great to be here.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So we've all eaten the turkey. Holiday shopping has begun in earnest. So let's talk about what the holiday shopping season looks like. We've got new surveys from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America that paint a modest picture of the holiday spending outlook. They say low and middle income Americans are planning to pull back a little bit because they perceive that prices are higher. And they say if spending is up this year, it's going to be because goods, in part, are more expensive. Is this the temporary result or long term result of the Trump tariffs?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, what we've seen- those were reports about what people anticipated would happen over the Thanksgiving weekend, but we now have hard data for Black Friday and even for Saturday and the online sales were up almost 10%, in store sales were up 4%, it was really a blockbuster weekend after Thanksgiving. And so I think that the folks who are saying, wow, maybe people are going to be anxious about going back and getting presents for the kids and so on. They've been disproven this weekend. And I think the reason is that people- incomes are up this year. We had a great jobs report and with strong income and the government shut down over so that people presumably have a little pent up demand as well. I think that we're looking at a great recovery from a weak few weeks because of the shutdown.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sure. I'm wondering how much of that spending increase you think is attributable to the fact that prices are up. Let me give you an example. The maker of Tonka Trucks said a couple days ago that a toy truck that cost $30 last year is going to cost $40 this year, partly because they lost about eight weeks of shipping due to the U.S. trade war with China. What's your advice to holiday shoppers who don't want to spend more this year than they did last year, or can't afford to spend more?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, as you know, it depends on what you're looking at. Like egg prices are down. Gasoline prices drop below $2 a gallon in a lot of places, mortgage rates are down--",
      "NANCY CORDES: --you mean below- gas prices on average are still at $3 a gallon.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah that's right for a few states they got below two. And so the point is just that- in the end, what matters is in the aggregate, the average across everything that everybody buys, and that averaged about 5% under Joe Biden, and is a little bit above two and a half percent- about cut in half for President Trump. And the bottom line, though, is really the wages have been growing faster than prices, and that's why real incomes this year are up by about $1,200 so far. That's why we could have a great Black Friday and a great Thanksgiving sales weekend because people feel like they have more money in their pockets. Even though you're right, there are some things that cost more, some things that cost less, but on average, we're about half the inflation rate of Joe Biden",
      "NANCY CORDES: Polls show that the public, despite some of the data you're presenting, is getting more skeptical. In our latest CBS News poll, 68% of Americans said they believe that President Trump's policies are pushing grocery prices up. They're up about 1.4% year to date. And economic sentiment, the number of people who think the economy is good, has actually dropped six points since he took office. How do you explain that?",
      "HASSETT: Well, first of all, you mentioned quite accurately, the 1.4% increase in grocery prices. I think the interesting thing about that is that that's way below the Fed's target of two for everything else, right? And so you'd have to concede that 1.4% is very, very low inflation. And so I think that the bottom line is that we've got the 'Big, Beautiful, Bill' cutting taxes on overtime, taxes for tips and so on, and all that money is going to start to be in people's pockets, and that's why they're optimistic about next year. Scott Bessent said last week that he's looking at first half of next year that could be in the 4% range. And the reason is that we passed the tax cuts in July, and so they didn't have time to change all the tax forms and everything. And so people are going to get really, really big refunds in the fall as well. And so we're really optimistic, and we think that the good news around Thanksgiving is a sign of something that's even stronger to come.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mentioned purchasing power. One thing that is going to affect purchasing power for 22 million Americans is the expiration of Obamacare premium subsidies. Last week, a funny situation. The White House floated this plan to extend the subsidies for two years, then you dropped the proposal, and then the President said on Air Force One, somebody said I wanted to extend it for two years. I don't want to extend it for two years. I'd rather not extend them at all. Was this a case of the right hand not talking to the left hand?",
      "HASSETT: No, I think that people were talking to each other. But what happened as, you know, as a professional journalist, is that sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional. And I think that somebody did that, and then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process, but President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care, and that's why we had $50 billion for rural hospitals in the 'Big, Beautiful, Bill,' why we tried to get $30 billion in for cost sharing. And the Democrats didn't like that. They had an alternative approach. And so I think that what we're going to see now, between now and Christmas, is that people are going to work- work this out, because we have a solution. The White House has a solution for cost- cost sharing, and the Democrats have an alternative. And, you know, people don't want for the few seniors that have really, really massive increases to see those. But don't forget, the vast majority of people in the Affordable Care Act are getting their insurance for less than $50 a month, and so- so while this is an issue that needs to be worked out, we don't want to cause panic for the folks who are worried that they're going to lose the thing that they have, it's really just the very, very high cost people who are closer to retirement age that have the problem.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Bloomberg is reporting, as I'm sure you know, that you are now considered the front runner to replace Fed Reserve Chair Jay Powell when his term expires in the spring. Secretary Bessent, who is heading up this search, said he was holding final interviews this week. How did yours go?",
      "HASSETT: You know, I am not sure that Bloomberg has the story right. I'm really honored to be amongst a group of really great candidates. The thing that I was most impressive about this week when that story leaked was that really, I think the news for markets was that President Trump is close to announcing a new person who is going to replace Jay Powell. And if you look at the market response to that, it was very, very positive. We had a great Treasury auction. Interest rates went down. And so I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who's going to help them, you know, have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates. And that's what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me, which, you know, is probably about as valuable as the rumor about the health care policy that we just talked about.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, I guess we'll find out if they're right sooner rather than later, when we hear the president's decision. So for now, Director of the White House, National Economic Council, that's your title today. Kevin Hassett, thank you so much.",
      "HASSETT: Thank you.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be back in a moment.",

      "NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We're joined by Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Absolutely, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to start out by asking you about the situation in Venezuela, because there are now serious signs that military action, including potentially ground action, could be imminent. You have tried twice to pass war powers resolutions that would force President Trump to get approval from Congress first before any military action. Twice, you have failed. Do you think the numbers on this will change if there is ground action, and will it even matter at that point?",
      "SEN. KAINE: I d- I do believe the numbers will change. You're right, I along with others, filed a resolution, no war in Venezuela or against Venezuela without congressional approval. It failed, but that was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela, and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed. I will move with colleagues, Senator Schumer, Senator Paul, Senator Schiff, immediately should there be military action. And then secondly, I also attempted to stop the, what I view as illegal boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific together with Adam Schiff, and the circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote. In each of these instances, we were able to get two Republicans to vote together with Democrats. We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations, so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth. We do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You're referring to this new Washington Post report that says that Secretary Hegseth called for everyone aboard, the first suspected drug boat that was targeted, to be killed when two people survived. The military went back in, reportedly with a follow-on strike. What questions do you have for the Pentagon about that situation?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, first, if that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DOD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance. And so this rises to the level of a war crime if it's true. And the questions that we've been asking for months are give us the evidence that the folks on board were really narcotraffickers. In one instance, there were two survivors, one Colombian, one Ecuadoran in a different strike. Instead of arresting them and prosecuting them, the U.S. picked them up and returned them to their countries of origin where they were released. So if they were narcotraffickers, why would we do that? We need more evidence about that. And we definitely need the administration to finally answer the question of why strike rather than interdict. If you know where the ships are, you can interdict. And when you do, you get evidence. You get individuals. You can squeeze them to give testimony against their higher-ups. You get evidence with the drug seizures. And finally, the other question that my colleagues and I are deeply worried about is the entire legal rationale for the strikes. We had to pry with a crowbar after weeks and weeks out of the administration. The supposed legal rationale for the strikes in international waters, it was very shoddy. Because it's classified, I can't tell you what's in it. But I can tell you it was not at all persuasive that these are legal actions. And so together with a whole series of things, the early retirement of the head of SOUTHCOM, the news that the SOUTHCOM's lead attorney said the strikes were not lawful, the decision of allies like the U.K. to stop sharing intelligence with the United States in this area because they believe the strikes are illegal. It's time for Congress to rein in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say so, which is not what the Constitution allows.",
      "NANCY CORDES: A lot of lawmakers on both sides have questions that are similar to the ones you're raising. On a related note, President Trump just announced this weekend that he plans to pardon former Honduras President Juan OrlandoHern\u00e1ndez, who was accused of conspiring with drug cartels to move 400 tons of cocaine from Honduras to the U.S. He's currently serving a 45-year sentence. Were you surprised by the President's plan to pardon him, given how strongly the President feels about drugs coming from other countries like Venezuela?\u00a0SEN. KAINE: This is shocking, and again, this is not an individual who was accused of running drugs to the United States. He was convicted in a federal court in the United States. One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House. And if he doesn't care about narcotrafficking, and this was also shown earlier this year with the pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, then what is this Venezuela thing really about? The President of Colombia has said that he thinks it's about the U.S. trying to seize oil assets in Venezuela. I lived in Honduras for a year as a missionary way back when. The conspiracy theories are running wild in the Americas about why this- this military effort is so important to the President when he's pardoning drug kingpins who are running drugs into the United States. These are also questions that we're going to have to dig deeply into when we return to Washington tomorrow.NANCY CORDES: I want to ask you about some big developments in Washington this week. The Trump administration is making big changes in the wake of this tragic shooting of two National Guard members. They are halting all asylum decisions. They are halting Afghan immigration applications. The President says he wants a permanent pause to immigration from what he calls \"third world countries,\" we don't know how many countries. Do they have a case that it makes sense to put some of these processes on hold while they figure out what happened here?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, you know, first, let's just acknowledge this sad fact, these two guards, members, Ms. Beckstrom andMr. Wolfe, what a tragedy for them and their families. And you know what? They should have been at home at Thanksgiving, celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, not deployed in a political deployment, to do law enforcement in D.C. that the D.C. police and other local law enforcement agencies can do. And this demonstrates, yet again, something we've seen so often our troops, including our guards members, they're going to serve in brave and courageous and self-sacrificing ways, and we can be so proud of them, but the orders that they get from their civilian leaders, that's where the problem comes in. Whether it's a Hegseth order to kill them all, or an order to send guardsmen and women in a political stunt deployment to cities around the country, these two individuals should have been celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, and I just mourn for them and all who suffer as a result. The President's decision to say, okay, this particular criminal who should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, who came in under an asylum grant, that President Trump and his administration decided this past summer, that now we're going to pause processes or asylum from 19 quote \"third world countries\" you don't know which ones they are. You shouldn't paint with a broad brush. Go after a criminal to the full extent of the law. But don't say that all Afghans in the United States, those who served with our military and who lost their lives and their health and their families in many ways by doing so, don't say that they're all bad. Don't say that people who come from third world countries are bad. Virginia, about one out of nine of us is an immigrant, and our immigrant communities in Virginia have been an enormous source of strength to our commonwealth and to our country. And it's wrong to target them all for the bad actions of an individual, just like we wouldn't target- target other communities in the United States for the bad actions of one individual.NANCY CORDES: Something tells me this is going to be a big topic of Congress- of conversation rather, in Congress--SEN. KAINE: --It will--NANCY CORDES: --this week. Senator Kaine, I really appreciate you being with us, and Happy Thanksgiving.SEN. KAINE: So glad we could do it. Thanks.\u00a0NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 30, 2025.",
      "NANCY CORDES: We're joined now by Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Congressman, thanks for being with us. Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thank you, Nancy. Happy Thanksgiving to you also.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, you heard what Sam Vinograd just had to say about the vetting process. You've also heard what administration officials are saying about it. Do you believe that this was a failure of vetting, or do you believe this is someone who just became radicalized or became mentally disturbed here in the United States?",
      "REP. TURNER: This is very difficult, because, I mean, this is classic terrorism. And this is where an individual who tries to break the heart of a nation who doesn't enact a murderous act right before Thanksgiving and the- I think what Samantha is missing in all of this is that we didn't go to Afghanistan to bring Afghanis here. We went to Afghanistan to kill Osama bin Laden, to dismantle and destroy al-Qaeda, to avenge 9//11, to dismantle and to overthrow the Taliban and to ensure that Afghanistan was no longer a safe haven for terrorism. What occurred is that the Biden administration allowed Afghanistan to fall and fled, and in doing so, then found itself in a situation where those who had been aiding us were then at risk, and in doing so made the decision--",
      "NANCY CORDES:-- You don't think they would have been at risk either way?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, they were- their intention was that they would be still there. That Afghanistan would no longer be a safe haven for terrorists, that it would not be a return to the Taliban, and there would not be a need for those people to be evacuated. You wouldn't see American planes on the tarmac, as you showed with people running to try to get on them. By the way, those planes wouldn't be being chased by people if they were on their way to China or Russia, they were on their way to America, and those people were fleeing what the Biden administration was allowing to unfold, which is that it would once again be a nation that would be at risk to us. And so, you know, that's how you get to the situation where those individuals are at risk. Now, obviously the vetting was flawed. By your own report, you showed that individuals who were on our known terrorist watch list made it into this country through that process. So obviously that the vetting process\u2013",
      "NANCY CORDES:-- But then- then they were identified--",
      "REP. TURNER:-- but they made it in. They made it in, right? They made it into this country. So obviously the process was flawed, and it was also a process that should have been unnecessary, if there hadn't been this hasty fall of Afghanistan. In which the Biden administration had promised us all that they were not going to run for the exits. And they not only ran for the exits, they did so at night. You know, Congress was, you know, after hearing, after hearing, you know, raised the issues of the manner in which the Biden administration fled and what the consequences would be. And we're all living with this consequence now, the investigation is underway.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Weren't their hands tied in part by the fact that Trump had cut a deal with the Taliban promising to leave by a certain date?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, their hands were not tied. The manner in which they did so, and Congress did a number of investigations, at a number of hearings, and filed a number of reports that showed that it was the actions of the Biden administration, a manner in which they completely withdrew. But that investigation is underway. It's going to be underway as to this individual, and I think we all need to wait for that investigation to be concluded.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The President has called for 500 more National Guard troops to be sent to the nation's capital. Your state has already contributed 150. Do you believe that more troops being deployed is the answer, or do you think it's time to wind this deployment down?",
      "REP. TURNER: When you ask this, is that the answer? You have to first talk about what the question is, and the question is, is there a national issue of- of crime and safety? And certainly the American people, by all polls, indicate that people are experiencing it and report that there is. And certainly in the nation's capital, there has been- there has been unbelievable reports of just the- the criminal activity, though, the- those individuals who have succumbed to, you know, violent crime. And certainly, there's been a reporting that the National Guard presence has made a difference.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Right. No question, I think crime is down 30% something like that in DC in the last four months. I want to turn to Ukraine now, another issue very important to you. A team of Ukrainian negotiators is meeting right now in Miami with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. What's your understanding of where the negotiations stand right now. There were concerns initially that the White House plan was too pro-Russia. Do you still have those concerns?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think we all have those concerns. The- the- you know, the President's goal of peace is incredibly important, and we saw today with Secretary Rubio his statement of, you know, we have to have a strong and sovereign Ukraine, and I- and that's everyone's goal, and the- and certainly a prosperous Ukraine. And we saw the Ukrainian representative there, who is, you know, committed. And we certainly think, and I think everyone thinks that President Zelenskyy is committed to peace. But you know, one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have- you can't be America first and pro-Russia, because Russia has- is a self declared adversary of the United States. It's fielding new, advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States. It's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber. It continuously identifies both NATO and the West, the United States as its adversary. So in this and of course, when it identifies Ukraine as its adversary, it does so in identifying the West and the United States as its adversary. You have to understand that the balance of this- this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Speaking of the question of being pro-Russian, this week, Bloomberg got a hold of this transcript of a call between Steve Witkoff, the special envoy, and a Putin advisor, in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching the Russian on how to win over President Trump. And there are several Republicans that have great concerns about that. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania called it a major problem. Don Bacon of Nebraska said Witkoff fully favors the Russians and should be fired. What do you think?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelensky was on his way to the White House. And I wouldn't want any orchestration of lessening President Zelenskyy's relationship with Trump, because it's very important when you have negotiations that, especially as you have, you know- in this instance Russia is being, you know, obviously, unbelievably murderous of the Ukrainian people. It is an aggressive authoritarian regime in this it's killing civilians. It is- it is not just this. Is not a military against military action. They are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine. The- the Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and the President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian murderous Putin.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So given your concerns, should Witkoff continue to serve as one of the main US negotiators here and should he be sent by President Trump to Moscow this week to meet with Putin?",
      "REP. TURNER: I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during a long, stretched out aspect of negotiations as reflective, but I think it's certainly important that when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern. And the orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy is very concerning, and I think the White House should be very concerned about any efforts to orchestrate Putin's voice at the White House before Zelenskyy's because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent. And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.",
      "NANCY CORDES: President Trump said this was just regular deal making. I want to turn to Venezuela, because you're on the House Armed Services Committee. We've all been watching the military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. Just yesterday, the President said airlines should consider Venezuelan airspace closed. Do you take that to mean that a military operation is imminent?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, the President did not say that, and the President certainly has not given Congress any notice that that is going to occur. And he certainly has not made the case. There is a buildup that the President has not explained in a way that relates solely to the actions that are currently going down in the Caribbean, and with respect to the drug trade that the President has been discussing with Congress, it is certainly a significant concern in Congress.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The Washington Post is reporting that before the strike on the very first suspected drug vote in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered that everyone on board be killed, and then when two of the 11 people on board survived, a follow-on strike was ordered to finish them off in the water. Now some law of war experts are saying that that was illegal, that killing people who are no longer able to fight is a war crime. What is your view and what questions do you have for the Pentagon?",
      "REP. TURNER: Congress does not have information that that had occurred. Both the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and ranking members have opened investigations. Obviously, if that occurred, that would be- be very serious, and I agree that- that- that would- would be an illegal act. That is not the legal opinion or the information or the legal justification, the acts that have been described to Congress that are being undertaken in- in this. There are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so-called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification has been provided. But this is- is completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress, and there is an ongoing investigation.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Very interesting to hear you say that this might be an illegal act. I know your committee is asking more questions. We'd love to learn what you find out. Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio, thank you so much for being with us.",
      "REP. TURNER: I appreciate it.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "An image of an ID badge circulating widely online that shows the suspect in the shooting of the National Guard members says he was assigned to the \"Kandahar Strike Force\" or \"03\" unit, one of a number of so-called \"Zero Units\" that worked closely with U.S. and other foreign forces during the war in Afghanistan. A former senior Afghan military source confirmed to CBS News that the ID badge is authentic.",
      "A U.S. official briefed on the shooting investigation and a former senior Afghan National Defense and Security Forces member told CBS News that the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had been part of a \"Zero Unit,\" an Afghan intelligence unit and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA. The units were exclusively composed of\u00a0Afghan nationals\u00a0and operated under the umbrella of the National Directorate of Security, or NDS, the intelligence agency established with CIA backing for Afghanistan's previous, U.S.-backed government. They were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among the most trusted domestic forces in Afghanistan.",
      "Those units are often labeled \"death squads\" by human rights groups. The units were known in Afghanistan for their secrecy and alleged brutality, and members were implicated in numerous extrajudicial killings of civilians, particularly during night raids.",
      "The U.S. official briefed on the investigation confirmed the suspect had been disturbed by the casualties in this unit and, more recently, deeply troubled by the killing of his close friend overseas.",
      "The image of the ID badge also carries the words \"Firebase Gecko,\" which was the name of a base used by the CIA and special forces in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, inside what was previously the compound of the Taliban's founding leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Thursday the suspect had previously worked \"with the U.S. Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.\"",
      "Lt. Gen. Sami Sadat, a former commanding general of the Afghan National Special Operations Corps, told CBS News that Lakanwal worked for the \"03\" unit for eight years. A former senior Afghan general under the U.S.-backed government told CBS News on Thursday that \"03 unit, also known as The Kandahar Strike Force (KSF), was under special forces directorate of NDS. They were the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA. All their operations were conducted under the CIA command.\" Lakanwal was part of the unit's operations team, Sadat said.",
      "\"He was known for being responsible and professional within his team and had strong anti-Taliban views,\" Sadat said.",
      "\"While we could not establish any connection between him and any terrorist organization, we also cannot completely rule it out,\" Sadat said. \"However, we can confirm that his background does not show any links to terrorists.\"",
      "Lakanwal's family faced serious threats from the Taliban, which led him to relocate them from their native Khost province to Kabul, Sadat said. In the U.S., Sadat said Lakanwal was \"generally calm and maintained a clean record, though he suffered from PTSD.\"",
      "As a member of a Zero Unit, the suspect would have been virtually guaranteed a route to asylum in the U.S. because members of these elite units were high on the list for\u00a0Taliban retaliation\u00a0after the group retook control of the country. Many members of these units played key roles in the August 2021\u00a0evacuation from Kabul, in return for a guarantee of space on a flight for themselves and their families out of Afghanistan.",
      "Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under the Obama administration, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that Afghan evacuees were thoroughly vetted prior to arriving in the U.S. after its withdrawal.",
      "In Lakanwal's case, the suspect would have been vetted by the CIA prior to joining the Zero Unit, Vinograd said, before referencing comments from national security leaders that suggested he became radicalized after coming to the U.S.",
      "\"This horrific tragedy could be the result of an individual that quickly mobilized to violence without any ties to foreign terrorism,\" said Vinograd. \"And, as we have discussed in other cases, trying to find lone actors before they initiate an attack is harder than trying to find a needle in a haystack.\"",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday asked the country's president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges \u2014 seeking to end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.",
      "Netanyahu, who has been battling the country's legal system over the charges, said the request would help unify the country at a time of momentous changes in the region. But it immediately triggered denunciations from his opponents, who said it would weaken Israel's democratic institutions and send a dangerous message that he is above the rule of law.",
      "In a statement Sunday the prime minister's office said that Netanyahu had submitted a request for a pardon to the legal department of the Office of the President. The president's office called it an \"extraordinary request,\" carrying with it \"significant implications.\"",
      "\"After receiving all of the relevant opinions, the President will responsibly and sincerely consider the request,\" said the office of Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, in a statement.",
      "Netanyahu is the only sitting prime minister in Israeli history to stand trial, after being charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases accusing him of exchanging favors with wealthy political supporters. He has not yet been convicted of anything.",
      "Netanyahu rejects the allegations, and has condemned the case as a witch hunt orchestrated by the media, police and judiciary.",
      "The request comes weeks after U.S. President Trump urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu. Earlier this month Mr. Trump also sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case \"political, unjustified prosecution.\"",
      "In a videotaped statement, Netanyahu said the trial has divided the country and that a pardon would help restore national unity. He also said the requirement that he appear in court three times a week is a distraction that makes it difficult for him to lead the country.",
      "\"The continuation of the trial tears us apart from within, stirs up this division, and deepens rifts. I am sure, like many others in the nation, that an immediate conclusion of the trial would greatly help to lower the flames and promote the broad reconciliation that our country so desperately needs,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu has taken the stand multiple times over the past year, but the case has been repeatedly delayed as he has dealt with wars and unrest stemming from the Hamas-led militant attacks of October 2023.",
      "Netanyahu's pardon request consisted of two documents \u2014 a detailed letter signed by his lawyer and a letter signed by Netanyahu. They'll be sent to the justice ministry for opinions and will then be transferred to the Legal Advisor in the Office of the President, which will formulate additional opinions for the president.",
      "Many legal experts say the pardon request is not able to stop the trial.",
      "\"It's impossible,\" said Emi Palmor, former director general of the justice ministry.",
      "\"You cannot claim that you're innocent while the trial is going on and come to the president and ask him to intervene,\" she said. The only way to stop the trial is to ask the attorney general to withhold the proceedings, she said.",
      "Netanyahu's request sparked an immediate response from the opposition, which urged the president not to give in to his request.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 08:23:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Preliminary investigations showed the fire started Wednesday afternoon on a lower-level scaffolding net of one of the buildings, and then spread rapidly inside as the foam panels caught fire and blew out windows.",
    "story": [
      "The death toll in Hong Kong's apartment complex blaze rose to 146 on Sunday as investigators discovered more bodies in the burned-out buildings. A steady stream of people placed bouquets of flowers at an ever-growing makeshift memorial at the scene of the disaster, among the worst in the city's history.",
      "The Hong Kong police Disaster Victim Identification Unit has been going through the buildings of the Wang Fuk Court complex meticulously and has found bodies both in apartment units and on the roofs, said the officer in charge, Cheng Ka-chun.",
      "The buildings remain structurally sound, but the search has been slow, he told reporters, still wearing his white coveralls with his hard hat and respiratory mask at his side. \"It is so dark inside, and because of the low light, it is very difficult to do the work, especially in places away from the windows.\"",
      "So far the team has examined four of the seven blocks, Cheng said.",
      "The latest searches turned up another 30 bodies, including 12 that had already been discovered by firefighters but hadn't been recovered, said Tsang Shuk-yin, the head of the Hong Kong police casualty unit.",
      "Another 100 people are unaccounted for and 79 have been injured, Tsang said.",
      "At the scene, well-wishers bowed and said short prayers, or left handwritten notes among the flowers.",
      "\"This really serves as a wake-up call for everyone, especially with these super high-rise buildings,\" said Lian Shuzheng, who waited in a line of hundreds of people to add her flowers to the growing cluster.",
      "People have also donated supplies to those who lost everything in the blaze, which started Wednesday and took until Friday to fully extinguish.",
      "The eight buildings of the Wang Fuk Court complex in the suburb of Tai Po had all been clad in bamboo scaffolding draped with nylon netting for renovations, with windows covered by polystyrene panels. Authorities were investigating whether fire codes were violated.",
      "Other constructions by the same builder are halted",
      "Hong Kong officials announced late Saturday they had ordered the immediate suspension of work on 28 building projects undertaken by the same contractor, the Prestige Construction & Engineering Company, for safety audits.",
      "\"The five alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po, exposed serious deficiencies of PC&E in site safety management, including the extensive use of foam boards to block up windows during building repairs,\" the government said in a statement.",
      "The company did not answer calls Sunday for comment.",
      "Three men \u2014 the directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company \u2014 were arrested the day after the fire broke out on suspicion of manslaughter, and police said company leaders were suspected of gross negligence. Police did not identify the firm by name.",
      "Those three were released on bail but then rearrested by Hong Kong's anti-corruption authorities, who have also arrested a further eight suspects including scaffolding subcontractors, directors of an engineering consulting company and the renovation project managers.",
      "Faulty fire alarms and foam panels under investigation",
      "The apartment complex of eight, 31-story buildings in Tai Po, a suburb near Hong Kong's border with mainland China, was built in the 1980s. It had almost 2,000 apartments and more than 4,600 residents.",
      "Many are now housed in short-term emergency shelters or city hotels, and authorities are working on longer-term solutions.",
      "\"It's heartbreaking,\" said Jeffery Chan, a civil servant who came to pay his respects on Sunday.",
      "\"As a Hong Konger, seeing people in the place where we live lose their families, lose everything in just one night \u2014 if you put yourself in their shoes, it is unbearable. They need encouragement, support and help from the people of Hong Kong,\" he said.",
      "Preliminary investigations showed the fire started Wednesday afternoon on a lower-level scaffolding net of one of the buildings, and then spread rapidly inside as the foam panels caught fire and blew out windows, according to Chris Tang, Hong Kong's secretary for security. Winds helped the flames jump from building to building and soon seven of the eight were engulfed.",
      "First responders found that some fire alarms in the complex, which housed many older people, did not sound when tested, according to Andy Yeung, the director of Hong Kong Fire Services.",
      "The dead included seven Indonesian migrant workers, and several dozen are still unaccounted for, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry said. One Filipina domestic helper was also killed and 12 others remain unaccounted for, according to the Philippines Consulate General in Hong Kong.",
      "On Sunday afternoon, several hundred Filipinos packed a pedestrian street in central Hong Kong, saying prayers and singing hymns in tribute to the fire victims.",
      "In Beijing, the Ministry of Emergency Management announced a nationwide inspection of high-rise buildings to identify and remove fire hazards.",
      "\"Bamboo scaffolding, non-flame-retardant safety nets... and firefighting facilities and equipment such as fire hydrant systems, automatic sprinkler systems and automatic fire alarm systems, will be among the main items to be inspected,\" the ministry said.",
      "The Wang Fuk Court fire is the worst on record since a warehouse blaze in 1948 killed 176 people.",
      "The deadliest fire in Hong Kong's recorded history was the 1918 Race Course Fire, in which more than 600 people were killed, according to the city's Antiquities and Monuments Office.",

      "Experts say a shark rarely attacks more than one person.",
      "The attack occurred at Crowdy Bay National Park, which is known for beach camping, fishing spots and hiking tracks 224 miles north of Sydney. The incident occurred just weeks after a shark\u00a0fatally mauled a surfer\u00a0at a beach off Sydney.",
      "Beaches in the area and to the north of the attack were closed to swimmers indefinitely, Police Chief Insp. Timothy Bayly said.",
      "Emergency services were called to Kylies Beach following reports that two people in their mid-20s had been bitten by a shark at 6:30 a.m., Bayly said.",
      "Bayly declined to detail the injuries or the circumstances of the attack. \"At this stage, all I'm prepared to say is they were known to each other and they were going for a swim and the shark attacked,\" Bayly told reporters.",

      "About all Behn left out in her animus toward Music City was dissing The Grand Ole Opry, hot chicken and Goo Goo Clusters. But if voters go goo goo over Behn Tuesday, Republicans face a cluster of another sort. A Behn victory may signal major problems for Republicans and President Trump heading into the midterms.",
      "Behn is characterized as the \"AOC of Tennessee,\" a reference to progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Republicans have been sure to boomerang that against Behn, suggesting she\u2019s not in tune with the district, leans too far to the left, and is closer to the liberal values of New York or Los Angeles than Nashville. Republicans believe Behn is just a bad fit for Nashville. Kind of like having Bad Bunny perform at the Ryman Auditorium.",

      "Let\u2019s explore what a Behn win might mean for Republicans. It could indicate that voters are tiring of Trump. Or that the GOP brand is toxic. Or perhaps it\u2019s the continuation of a trend which Democrats enjoyed this fall: near blowout wins by New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and\u00a0Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger.",
      "But there\u2019s a downside for Democrats. Yes. They may flip the seat. But a win may also show that the party is tilting more to the left. It would be hard to argue with success if Behn prevails, regardless of her progressive streak. But this may give other liberals ideas that they can win in other red or purple districts. That may work against Democrats \u2014 especially since every Republican, except President Trump, has highlighted the left-wing politics of New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.",
      "Democrats probably need to run more centrist candidates in purple areas to regain control of the House. A Behn victory could open the floodgates for a host of progressive candidates in competitive House districts nationwide. Behn\u2019s message \u2014 or that of Ocasio-Cortez or Mamdani \u2014 won\u2019t work in most places where Democrats need to be successful to seize control of the House.",

      "Yes, there were five special elections in 2017 \u2014 the first year Trump was originally in office \u2014 which Democrats made competitive. All were closer than they should have been. But Democrats didn\u2019t win any of them. Still, astute political observers suggested there was unpopularity with the president and the GOP agenda. Democrats won 40 seats and gained control of the House in the 2017 midterms.",
      "So, even if Van Epps wins, examine the margin. And if Behn wins, see if Republicans downplay it because it was a special election and the customary electorate just doesn\u2019t turn out for special elections. Especially one wedged between Thanksgiving and Christmas.",
      "If Republicans hold the seat, the GOP will argue this was a repudiation of a leftist like Behn and someone who was out of step. They will also suggest that it\u2019s a GOP seat and Republicans should win anyway. That\u2019s what happened earlier this year when there was consternation before two Florida special elections. But Florida Republican Reps. Randy Fine and Jimmy Patronis both won in March.",
      "Here\u2019s another factor which bears watching: the message the press corps and political observers glean from the election results. After all, special elections are always special. It\u2019s natural for analysts and journalists to search for particular meanings or signposts in these contests. Such was the case with the off-year elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. Sometimes these observations are spot-on. Other times, they mean nothing.

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent Madison Scarpino reports on the latest in the Tennessee special election on 'The Big Weekend Show.'",
      "We\u2019ll know Wednesday morning if a special election in Tennessee is truly a referendum on country music, pedal taverns and bachelorettes.",
      "Or, if we can divine a deeper political meaning from the results of the special election in Tennessee\u2019s 7th Congressional District.",
      "Democrat Aftyn Behn is trying to tip the scales in favor of her party in a district which President Trump carried by about 20 points and former Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., won by a similar percentage last fall.",
      "Behn faces GOPer Matt Van Epps. It\u2019s a Republican district. But political observers are watching the race to gauge potential weakness by President Trump, a softness in the Trump coalition, issues with the Republican brand or early indications of a possible blue wave in the 2026 midterms.",
      "DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS GO ALL IN ON FINAL 2025 CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT BOX SHOWDOWN",
      "Depending on who you ask, the race for Tennessee's 7th congressional district \u2013 between Republican nominee Matt Van Epps, former state Department of General Services, and Aftyn Behn, a Democratic state representative \u2013 may be headed for a photo finish. (George Walker IV/AP Photo)",
      "It was Behn who proclaimed that she abhorred Nashville several years ago. \"I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music. I hate all the things that make Nashville apparently an \u2018it city,\u2019\" complained Behn.",
      "About all Behn left out in her animus toward Music City was dissing The Grand Ole Opry, hot chicken and Goo Goo Clusters. But if voters go goo goo over Behn Tuesday, Republicans face a cluster of another sort. A Behn victory may signal major problems for Republicans and President Trump heading into the midterms.",
      "Behn is characterized as the \"AOC of Tennessee,\" a reference to progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Republicans have been sure to boomerang that against Behn, suggesting she\u2019s not in tune with the district, leans too far to the left and is closer to the liberal values of New York or Los Angeles than Nashville. Republicans believe Behn is just a bad fit for Nashville. Kind of like having Bad Bunny perform at the Ryman Auditorium.",
      "\"It shouldn\u2019t even be close. But it is,\" mused Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., on Fox.",
      "So Republicans are pouring in money to protect the seat. Democrats are pouring in money to steal the seat. If Democrats pull off the upset, the party should uproot the goalposts at FirstBank Stadium in downtown Nashville and dump it in the Cumberland River. Kind of what Vanderbilt fans did last year when the Commodores upset number one-ranked Alabama.",
      "Let\u2019s explore what a Behn win might mean for Republicans. It could indicate that voters are tiring of President Trump. Or that the GOP brand is toxic. Or perhaps it\u2019s the continuation of a trend which Democrats enjoyed this fall: near blowout wins by New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and\u00a0Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger.",
      "But there\u2019s a downside for Democrats. Yes. They may flip the seat. But a win may also show that the party is tilting more to the left. It would be hard to argue with success if Behn prevails, regardless of her progressive streak. But this may give other liberals ideas that they can win in other red or purple districts. That may work against Democrats \u2013 especially since every Republican, except President Trump \u2013 has highlighted the left-wing politics of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.",
      "TRUMP MAKES 11TH-HOUR PLEA FOR MATT VAN EPPS OVER AFTYN BEHN, WHOM HE CLAIMS 'HATES CHRISTIANITY'",
      "Democrats probably need to run more centrist candidates in purple areas to regain control of the House. A Behn victory could open the floodgates for a host of progressive candidates in competitive House districts nationwide. Behn\u2019s message \u2013 or that of Ocasio-Cortez or Mamdani \u2013 won\u2019t work in most places where Democrats need to be successful to seize control of the House.",
      "But what if Republicans hold the seat and Van Epps wins?",
      "It probably depends by how much.",
      "Yes, there were five special elections in 2017 \u2013 the first year President Trump was originally in office \u2013 which Democrats made competitive. All were closer than they should have been. But Democrats didn\u2019t win any of them. Still, astute political observers suggested there was unpopularity with the president and the GOP agenda. Democrats won 41 seats and gained control of the House in the 2018 midterms.",
      "So, even if Van Epps wins, examine the margin. And if Behn wins, see if Republicans downplay it because it was a special election and the customary electorate just doesn\u2019t turn out for special elections. Especially one wedged between Thanksgiving and Christmas.",
      "If Republicans hold the seat, the GOP will argue this was a repudiation of a leftist like Behn and someone who was out of step. They will also suggest that it\u2019s a GOP seat and Republicans should win anyway. That\u2019s what happened earlier this year when there was consternation before two Florida special elections. But Reps. Randy Fine, R-Fla., and Jimmy Patronis, R-Fla., both won in March.",
      "If Van Epps wins, one must still pay attention to the margin. The seat, last held by former Rep. Mark Green, broke for President Trump by over 20% in 2024. (Nicole Hester/The Tennessean/USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images)",
      "Here\u2019s another factor which bears watching: the message the press corps and political observers glean from the election results. After all, special elections are always special. It\u2019s natural for analysts and journalists to search for particular meanings or signposts in these contests. Such was the case with the off-year elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. Sometimes these observations are spot-on. Other times, they mean nothing. If anything, there is a tendency to over-illuminate the outcomes of these contests. They are moments in time. Kind of like listening to a few bars of a song. Maybe it tells you a lot about the song. Maybe not.",
      "House Republicans could well freak out if Behn is victorious. There\u2019s lots of grumbling among Republicans. Some are frustrated by how their leadership handled the government shutdown. And others could follow Mark Green and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and hit the exits early.",
      "This is a fragile time for House Republicans. That\u2019s one reason why a flip of this seat could mean a little bit more.",
      "DEM HOUSE HOPEFUL GETTING YANKED FROM GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DURING ATTEMPTED SIT-IN GOES VIRAL AHEAD OF ELECTION",
      "Still, it\u2019s rare to flip seats in House special elections. Former Rep. Don Cazayoux, D-La., won a special election in a red district in Louisiana in 2008 after former Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., resigned. But current Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., then won that seat in the general election and served in the House before moving to the Senate.",
      "Former Rep. Mayra Flores, R-Texas, flipped the seat held by former Rep. Filemon Vela, D-Texas, in 2022. But she lost reelection that fall.",
      "Former Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., won a special election in 2020 after former Rep. Katie Hill, D-Calif., resigned just months into office. Garcia held the seat until Rep. George Whitesides, D-Calif., defeated him a year ago.",
      "Former Rep. Charles Djou, R-Hawaii, won a special election in Hawaii in 2010 against two Democrats \u2013 former Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, D-Hawaii, and Rep. Ed Case, D-Hawaii. But Democrats got the seat back in 2012.",
      "Former Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, won a special election in 2022 to flip Alaska\u2019s at-large district from red to blue following the death of late Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska. Young held the seat for nearly 50 years. But Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, defeated Peltola last year.",
      "Just because seats are won in special election upsets, doesn't mean they've permanently fallen to the other party. Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, who unseated his Democratic predecessor, former Rep. Mary Peltola \u2013 herself a special election victor \u2013 is a prime example. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)",
      "In short, even if someone flips a seat, it\u2019s rare that they have the seat for long. Often, only through the next regular election.",
      "So a word of caution as you evaluate the election results on Tuesday night. If Republicans hold the seat, that may be expected. If Democrats flip the seat, some will proclaim it\u2019s the second coming of the Music City Miracle.",

      "A new phishing scam is getting a lot of attention because it uses real Apple Support tickets to trick people into giving up their accounts. Broadcom's Eric Moret shared how he nearly lost his entire Apple account after trusting what looked like official communication. He described the full experience in a detailed post on Medium, where he walked through the scam step by step.",
      "This scheme stands out because the scammers relied on Apple's own support system to make their messages look legitimate. They created an experience that felt polished and professional from the first alert to the final phone call. Here's how the scam unfolded.",

      "Scammers are exploiting real Apple Support tickets to trick users into handing over their accounts, experts warn. (Photo by STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "How the scam starts",
      "Moret first received a flood of alerts. These included two-factor authentication notifications that claimed someone was trying to access his iCloud account. Within minutes, he got phone calls from calm, helpful callers who claimed to be Apple agents ready to fix the issue.",
      "The twist is how convincing the entire setup felt. The scammers were able to exploit a flaw in Apple's Support system that lets anyone create a genuine support ticket without verification. They opened a real Apple Support case in his name, which triggered official emails from an Apple domain. This built instant trust and lowered Moret's guard.",
      "How scammers gained access to the account",
      "During a 25-minute call, the fake agents guided Moret through what they said would secure his account. They walked him through the steps to reset his iCloud password. They also told him a link would follow so he could close the case.",
      "That link took him to a fake site called appeal apple dot com. The page looked official and claimed his account was being secured. It then told him to enter a six-digit code sent by text to finish the process.",
      "When Moret entered that code, the scammers got exactly what they needed to sign into his account.",
      "He then got an alert that his Apple ID had been used to sign into a Mac mini he did not own. That confirmed the takeover attempt. Even though the scammer on the phone said this was normal, he trusted his instinct. He reset his password again, which kicked them out and stopped the attack.",

      "A Broadcom executive says he nearly lost access to his Apple ID after trusting a fraudulent support call that looked legitimate. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "How to protect yourself from the Apple Support ticket scam",
      "This type of scam works because it feels real. The messages look official, and the callers sound trained. Still, you can stay safer by watching out for signs that something is off.",
      "Scammers created a real-looking ticket to make the entire experience seem legitimate. You can confirm what's real by checking directly with Apple. Sign in at appleid.apple.com or open the Apple Support app to view your recent cases. If the case number isn't listed there, the message is fake, even if the email comes from an Apple domain.",
      "Never stay on a call that you did not initiate. Scammers rely on long conversations to build trust and pressure you into quick decisions. Hang up right away and call Apple Support directly at 1-800-275-2273 or through the Support app. A real agent will quickly confirm whether anything is wrong.",
      "If something feels off, look at the devices signed into your account. Go to\u00a0Settings, tap your\u00a0name and scroll to see all devices\u00a0linked to your Apple ID. Remove anything you don't recognize. This step can stop attackers fast if they've managed to get in.",
      "No real support agent will ever ask for your two-factor authentication codes. Treat any request for these codes as a major warning.",
      "Look closely at URLs. Fake sites often add extra words or change formatting to appear real. Apple will never send you to a site like appeal apple dot com.",

      "Criminals are using Apple\u2019s own support system to generate real case emails that build false confidence with victims. (Photo by Fairfax Media via Getty Images via Getty Images)",
      "Strong antivirus software can spot dangerous links, unsafe sites, and fake support messages before you tap them. Anti-phishing tools are especially important with scams like this one since the attackers used a fake site and real ticket emails to trick victims.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Data brokers collect your phone number, home address, email, and other details that scammers use to personalize attacks. A data removal service can wipe much of that information from broker sites, which makes you a harder target for social engineering attempts like the one described in this article.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This scam shows how convincing criminals can be when they exploit real systems. Even careful users can fall for messages that look official and calls that sound professional. The best defense is to stay alert and take a moment before responding to anything unexpected. When you slow down, double-check support tickets, and never share verification codes, you make yourself far harder to fool. Adding layers like antivirus protection and data removal services also gives you more control over what attackers can access. These simple habits can stop even the most polished scams before they get to your accounts.",

      "The controversy started when the Public Interest Research Group Education Fund tested three different AI toys. All of them produced concerning answers that touched on religion, Norse mythology and harmful household items.",
      "Kumma stood out for the wrong reasons. When the bear used the Mistral model, it offered tips on where to find knives, pills and matches. It even outlined steps to light a match and blow it out.",
      "Tests with the GPT-4o model raised even sharper concerns. Kumma gave advice related to kissing and launched into detailed explanations of adult sexual content when prompted. The bear pushed further by asking the young user what they wanted to explore.",

      "Why FoloToy restored Kumma's sales after its safety review",
      "FoloToy brought Kumma back to its online store just one week after suspending sales. The fast return drew attention from parents and safety experts who wondered if the company had enough time to fix the serious issues identified in PIRG's report.",
      "FoloToy posted a detailed statement on X that laid out its version of what happened. In the post, the company said it viewed child safety as its\u00a0\"highest priority\" and that it was\u00a0\"the only company to proactively suspend sales, not only of the product mentioned in the report, but also of our other AI toys.\" FoloToy said it took this action \"immediately after the findings were published because we believe responsible action must come before commercial considerations.\"",
      "The company also emphasized to CyberGuy that it was the only one of the three AI toy startups in the PIRG review to suspend sales across all of its products and that it made this decision during the peak Christmas sales season, knowing the commercial impact would be significant. FoloToy told us, \"Nevertheless, we moved forward decisively, because we believe that responsible action must always come before commercial interests.\"",
      "The company also said it took the report's disturbing examples seriously. According to FoloToy, the issues were \"directly addressed in our internal review.\" It explained that the team\u00a0\"initiated a deep, company-wide internal safety audit,\" then \"strengthened and upgraded our content-moderation and child-safety safeguards,\" and\u00a0\"deployed enhanced safety rules and protections through our cloud-based system.\"",
      "After outlining these steps, the company said it spent the week on\u00a0\"rigorous review, testing, and reinforcement of our safety modules.\" It concluded its announcement by saying it\u00a0\"began gradually restoring product sales\" as those updated safeguards went live.",
      "FoloToy added that as global attention on AI toy risks grows,\u00a0\"transparency, responsibility and continuous improvement are essential,\" and that the company\u00a0\"remains firmly committed to building safe, age-appropriate AI companions for children and families worldwide.\"",

      "PIRG researcher RJ Cross said her team plans to test the updated toys to see if the fixes hold up. She noted that a week feels fast for such significant changes, and only new tests will show if the product now behaves safely.",
      "Parents will want to follow this closely as AI-powered toys grow more common. The speed of FoloToy's relaunch raises questions about the depth of its review.",
      "Tips for parents before buying AI toys",
      "AI toys can feel exciting and helpful, but they can also surprise you with content you'd never expect. If you plan to bring an AI-powered toy into your home, these simple steps can help you stay in control.",
      "Not every model follows the same guardrails. Some include stronger filters while others may respond too freely. Look for transparent disclosures about which model powers the toy and what safety features support it.",
      "Groups like PIRG often test toys in ways parents cannot. These reviews flag hidden risks and point out behavior you may not catch during quick demos.",
      "Keep AI toys in shared spaces where you can hear or see how your child interacts with it. This helps you step in if the toy gives a concerning answer.",
      "Ask the toy questions, try creative prompts and see how it handles tricky topics. This lets you learn how it behaves before you hand it to your child.",
      "Many AI toys run on cloud systems. Updates often add stronger safeguards or reduce risky answers. Make sure the device stays current.",
      "AI toys can gather voice data, location info or behavioral patterns. A strong privacy policy should explain what is collected, how long it is stored and who can access it.",

The video shows how close companies like Tesla want us to be to a future filled with robots that move, react and work alongside us. The reactions range from excitement to real concern, which shows how uneasy many feel about a world shaped by machines that can cook, patrol and even respond to emergencies. The speed of this progress is hard to ignore. Each new video hints at a future where robots handle more daily tasks and take on work that once needed human hands. Whether that future feels promising or unsettling will depend on how we prepare for it and how much control we keep as this technology grows.",

    "story": [
      "FOX Business correspondent Darren Botelho reports on growing concerns about the misuse of artificial intelligence after a major U.S. company, Anthropic, detected a cyberattack using AI by Chinese-sponsored hackers.",
      "Cybersecurity has been reshaped by the rapid rise of advanced artificial intelligence tools, and recent incidents show just how quickly the threat landscape is shifting.",
      "Over the past year, we've seen a surge in attacks powered by AI models that can write code, scan networks and automate complex tasks. This capability has helped defenders, but it has also enabled attackers to move faster than before.",
      "The latest example is a major cyberespionage campaign conducted by a Chinese state-linked group that used Anthropic's Claude to carry out large parts of an attack with very little human involvement.",
      "HACKER EXPLOITS AI CHATBOT IN CYBERCRIME SPREE",

      "How Chinese hackers turned Claude into an automated attack machine",
      "In mid-September 2025, Anthropic investigators spotted unusual behavior that eventually revealed a coordinated and well-resourced campaign. The threat actor, assessed with high confidence as a Chinese state-sponsored group, had used Claude Code to target roughly 30 organizations worldwide. The list included major tech firms, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government bodies. A small number of those attempts resulted in successful breaches.",
      "Claude handled most of the operation autonomously, triggering thousands of requests and generating detailed documentation of the attack for future use. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "This was not a typical intrusion. The attackers built a framework that let Claude act as an autonomous operator. Instead of asking the model to help, they tasked it with executing most of the attack. Claude inspected systems, mapped out internal infrastructure and flagged databases worth targeting. The speed was unlike anything a human team could replicate.",
      "To get around Claude's safety rules, the attackers broke their plan into tiny, innocent-looking steps. They also told the model it was part of a legitimate cybersecurity team performing defensive testing. Anthropic later noted that the attackers didn't simply hand tasks to Claude; they engineered the operation to make the model believe it was performing authorized pentesting work, splitting the attack into harmless-looking pieces and using multiple jailbreak techniques to push past its safeguards. Once inside, Claude researched vulnerabilities, wrote custom exploits, harvested credentials and expanded access. It worked through these steps with little supervision and reported back only when it needed human approval for major decisions.",
      "The model also handled the data extraction. It collected sensitive information, sorted it by value and identified high-privilege accounts. It even created backdoors for future use. In the final stage, Claude generated detailed documentation of what it had done. This included stolen credentials, systems analyzed and notes that could guide future operations.",
      "Across the entire campaign, investigators estimate that Claude performed around 80-90% of the work. Human operators stepped in only a handful of times. At its peak, the AI triggered thousands of requests, often multiple per second, a pace still far beyond what any human team could achieve. Although it occasionally hallucinated credentials or misread public data as secret, those errors underscored that fully autonomous cyberattacks still face limitations, even when an AI model handles the majority of the work.",
      "Why this AI-powered Claude attack is a turning point for cybersecurity",
      "This campaign shows how much the barrier to high-end cyberattacks has dropped. A group with far fewer resources could now attempt something similar by leaning on an autonomous AI agent to do the heavy lifting. Tasks that once required years of expertise can now be automated by a model that understands context, writes code and uses external tools without direct oversight.",
      "Earlier incidents documented AI misuse, but humans were still steering every step. This case is different. The attackers needed very little involvement once the system was in motion. And while the investigation focused on usage within Claude, researchers believe similar activity is happening across other advanced models, which might include Google Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT or Musk's Grok.",
      "This raises a difficult question. If these systems can be misused so easily, why continue building them? According to researchers, the same capabilities that make AI dangerous are also what make it essential for defense. During this incident, Anthropic's own team used Claude to analyze the flood of logs, signals and data its investigation uncovered. That level of support will matter even more as threats grow.",
      "We reached out to Anthropic for comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Hackers used Claude to map networks, scan systems and identify high-value databases in a fraction of the time human attackers would need. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "7 ways you can protect yourself from AI-driven cyberattacks",
      "You may not be the direct target of a state-sponsored campaign, but many of the same techniques trickle down to everyday scams, credential theft and account takeovers. Here are seven detailed steps you can take to stay safer.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for known malware. It looks for suspicious patterns, blocked connections and abnormal system behavior. This is important because AI-driven attacks can generate new code quickly, which means traditional signature-based detection is no longer enough.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "A good password manager helps you create long, random passwords for every service you use. This matters because AI can generate and test password variations at high speed. Using the same password across accounts can turn a single leak into a full compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "A large part of modern cyberattacks begins with publicly available information. Attackers often gather email addresses, phone numbers, old passwords and personal details from data broker sites. AI tools make this even easier, since they can scrape and analyze huge datasets in seconds. A personal data removal service helps clear your information from these broker sites so you are harder to profile or target.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "Strong passwords alone are not enough when attackers can steal credentials through malware, phishing pages or automated scripts. Two-factor authentication adds a serious roadblock. Use app-based codes or hardware keys instead of SMS. While no method is perfect, this extra layer often stops unauthorized logins even when attackers have your password.",
      "Attackers rely heavily on known vulnerabilities that people forget or ignore. System updates patch these flaws and close off entry points that attackers use to break in. Enable automatic updates on your phone, laptop, router and the apps you use most. If an update looks optional, treat it as important anyway, because many companies downplay security fixes in their release notes.",
      "Malicious apps are one of the easiest ways attackers get inside your device. Stick to official app stores and avoid APK sites, shady download portals and random links shared on messaging apps. Even on official stores, check reviews, download counts and the developer name before installing anything. Grant the minimum permissions required and avoid apps that ask for full access for no clear reason.",
      "AI tools have made phishing more convincing. Attackers can generate clean messages, imitate writing styles and craft perfect fake websites that match the real ones. Slow down when a message feels urgent or unexpected. Never click links from unknown senders, and verify requests from known contacts through a separate channel. If a pop-up claims your device is infected or your bank account is locked, close it and check directly through the official website.",
      "By breaking tasks into small, harmless-looking steps, the threat actors tricked Claude into writing exploits, harvesting credentials and expanding access.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The attack carried out through Claude signals a major shift in how cyber threats will evolve. Autonomous AI agents can already perform complex tasks at speeds no human team can match, and this gap will only widen as models improve. Security teams now need to treat AI as a core part of their defensive toolkit, not a future add-on. Better threat detection, stronger safeguards and more sharing across the industry are going to be crucial. Because if attackers are already using AI at this scale, the window to prepare is shrinking fast.",

    "story": [
      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "Android users have been dealing with a steady rise in financial malware for years. Threats like Hydra, Anatsa and Octo have shown how attackers can take over a phone, read everything on the screen and drain accounts before you even notice anything wrong. Security updates have helped slow some of these strains, but malware authors keep adapting with new tricks.",
      "The latest variant spotted in circulation is one of the most capable yet. It can silence your phone, take screenshots of banking apps, read clipboard entries, and even automate crypto wallet transactions. This threat is now known as Android BankBot YNRK, and it is far more advanced than typical mobile malware.",

      "How the malware infiltrates devices",
      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "Android banking malware is getting harder to spot as attackers use new tricks to take over phones and drain accounts. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "BankBot YNRK hides inside fake Android apps that appear legitimate when installed. In the samples analyzed by researchers at Cyfirma, the attackers used apps that impersonated official digital ID tools. Once installed, the malware begins profiling the device by collecting details such as brand, model and installed apps. It checks whether the device is an emulator to avoid automated security analysis. It also maps known models to screen resolutions, which helps it tailor its behavior to specific phones.",
      "To blend in, the malware can disguise itself as Google News. It does this by changing its app name and icon, then loading the real news.google.com site inside a WebView. While the victim believes the app is genuine, the malware quietly runs its background services.",
      "One of its first actions is to mute audio and notification alerts. This prevents victims from hearing incoming messages, alarms or calls that could signal unusual account activity. It then requests access to Accessibility Services. If granted, this allows the malware to interact with the device interface just like a user. From that point onward, it can press buttons, scroll through screens and read everything displayed on the device.",
      "BankBot YNRK also adds itself as a Device Administrator app. This makes it harder to remove and helps it restart itself after a reboot. To maintain long-term access, it schedules recurring background jobs that relaunch the malware every few seconds as long as the phone is connected to the internet.",
      "What does the malware steal",
      "Once the malware receives commands from its remote server, it gains near-complete control of the phone. It sends device information and installed app lists to the attackers, then receives a list of financial apps it should target. This list includes major banking apps used in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, along with several global cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "With Accessibility permissions enabled, the malware can read everything shown on the screen. It captures UI metadata such as text, view IDs and button positions. This helps it reconstruct a simplified version of any app's interface. Using this data, it can enter login details, swipe through menus or confirm transfers. It can also set text inside fields, install or remove apps, take photos, send SMS, turn call forwarding on and open banking apps in the background while the screen appears inactive.",
      "In cryptocurrency wallets, the malware acts like an automated bot. It can open apps such as Exodus or MetaMask, read balances and seed phrases, dismiss biometric prompts, and carry out transactions. Because all actions happen through Accessibility, the attacker never needs your passwords or PINs. Anything visible on the screen is enough.",
      "The malware also monitors the clipboard, so if users copy OTPs, account numbers or crypto keys, the data is immediately sent to the attackers. With call forwarding enabled, incoming bank verification calls can be silently redirected. All of these actions happen within seconds of the malware activating.",

The Play Store is not perfect, but it offers scanning, app verification and regular take-downs that greatly reduce the risk of installing infected apps.",

      "A password manager helps you create long, unique passwords for every account. It also saves you from typing passwords directly into apps, which reduces the chance of malware capturing them from your clipboard or keystrokes.

It cannot stop malware that takes over your device, but it significantly limits how far an attacker can go with stolen credentials.",
      "GOOGLE ISSUES WARNING ON FAKE VPN APPS",
      "Malware often abuses permissions such as Accessibility or Device Admin because they allow deep control over your phone. Check your settings to see which apps have these permissions and remove anything that looks unfamiliar. Also, look through your installed apps and uninstall any tool or service you do not remember adding. Regular reviews help you spot threats early before they can steal data.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "BankBot YNRK is one of the most capable Android banking threats discovered recently. It combines device profiling, strong persistence, UI automation and data theft to gain full control over a victim's financial apps. Because much of its activity relies on Accessibility permissions, a single tap from the user can give attackers complete access. Staying safe means avoiding unofficial APKs, reviewing installed apps regularly and being cautious of any sudden request to enable special permissions.",

      "BRAIN IMPLANT TURNS THOUGHTS INTO DIGITAL COMMANDS",
      "How the brain implant works",
      "The implant uses hundreds of tiny electrodes to capture detailed signals from the motor cortex where the brain forms sounds and shapes words. (Paradromics)",
      "Paradromics developed a fully implantable speech-focused brain device called the Connexus BCI. The company designed it to capture detailed neural signals that support real-time communication for people who cannot speak. This system uses high-resolution electrodes and an implanted wireless setup to record activity from individual neurons involved in forming speech.",
      "The Connexus BCI has a titanium body with more than 400 platinum-iridium electrodes placed just below the brain's surface. Each electrode is thinner than a human hair. These electrodes record neural firing patterns in the motor cortex, where the brain controls the lips, tongue and larynx.",
      "Surgeons place the implant under the skin and connect it with a thin cable to a wireless transceiver in the chest. That transceiver sends data through a secure optical link to a second transceiver worn on the body. The external unit powers the system with inductive charging similar to wireless phone chargers.",
      "The collected signals then move to a compact computer that runs advanced language models. It analyzes the neural activity and converts it into text or into a synthetic voice based on the user's past recordings.",
      "Inside the Paradromics BCI human trial",
      "The trial begins with two participants. Each person will receive one 7.5-millimeter-wide electrode array placed 1.5 millimeters into the part of the motor cortex that controls the lips, tongue and larynx. During training sessions, the volunteers will imagine speaking sentences while the device learns the neural signatures of each sound.",
      "This is the first BCI trial that formally targets real-time synthetic voice generation. The study will also test whether the system can detect imagined hand movements and translate those signals into cursor control.",
      "If early results meet expectations, the trial could expand to ten people. Some participants may receive two implants to capture a richer set of signals.",
      "HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT",
      "Cyberguy reached out to Paradromics for comment and received the following statement:",
      "Researchers are testing whether Paradromics\u2019 fully implantable brain device can turn neural activity into real-time speech for people with paralysis. (Synchron)",
      "\"Communication is a fundamental human need. For people with severe motor impairment, the inability to express themselves with family and friends or request basic needs makes living difficult. The FDA approved clinical study for the Connexus Brain-Computer Interface is the first step toward a future where commercially available neurotech can restore the ability to naturally speak and seamlessly use a computer.",
      "The fully implanted Connexus BCI is designed to record brain signals from individual neurons, capturing the massive amounts of data required for high performance applications like speech restoration and complex mouse and keyboard hand actions. Built from proven medical-grade materials, Connexus BCI is engineered for daily long-term use, backed by more than three years of stable pre-clinical recordings.",
      "How Paradromics compares to other BCI companies",
      "Paradromics joins Synchron and Neuralink at the front of the implanted BCI race. Synchron uses a stent-like device placed in a blood vessel to record broad neural patterns. Neuralink uses flexible threads with many recording sites to capture high-bandwidth signals from individual neurons.",
      "Paradromics sits in the middle of these two approaches by using a fully implantable system that still captures single-neuron detail. Researchers believe this design may offer long-term stability for everyday communication.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could make a major difference for people who have lost their ability to speak after ALS, stroke or spinal cord injury. A system that converts thought into speech could help them talk in real time and regain independence. It may also allow hands-free computer control, which can improve daily living.",
      "If the trial succeeds, the tech could change how assistive communication devices work and speed up patient access to advanced tools.",
      "During the trial, volunteers imagine speaking while advanced AI models learn their neural patterns and convert those signals into text or a synthetic voice. (Paradromics)",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com",
      "BRAIN IMPLANT FOR EPILEPSY TESTED IN 20-MINUTE SURGERY",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Paradromics is taking a careful but bold path toward practical BCI communication. The first stage is small but meaningful. It sets the foundation for devices that may restore speech with natural flow and faster response times. As more trials move forward, this field could shift from experimental to everyday use faster than many expect.",

    "story": [
      "A new report by the Wall Street Journal is warning people to think twice before trusting the 'unsubscribe' option at the bottom of promotional emails.",
      "Attackers have a new tool that targets Microsoft 365 users at a massive scale.",
      "Security researchers say a phishing platform called Quantum Route Redirect, or QRR, is behind a growing wave of fake login pages hosted on nearly 1,000 domains. These pages look real enough to fool many users while also slipping past some automated scanners.",
      "QRR runs realistic email lures that mimic DocuSign requests, payment notices, voicemail alerts or QR-code prompts. Each message routes victims to a fake Microsoft 365 login page built to harvest usernames and passwords. The kit often lives on parked or compromised legitimate domains that add a false sense of safety for anyone who clicks.",
      "Researchers tracked QRR in 90 countries. About 76% of attacks hit US users. That scale makes QRR one of the largest phishing operations active right now.",
      "WINDOWS 10 USERS FACE RANSOMWARE NIGHTMARE AS MICROSOFT SUPPORT ENDS IN 2025 WORLDWIDE",

      "Attackers use fake Microsoft security alerts to trick people into entering their Microsoft 365 passwords. (Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "A fast follow to other major Microsoft credential attacks",
      "QRR appeared soon after Microsoft disrupted a major phishing network known as RaccoonO365. That service sold ready-made Microsoft login copies used to steal more than 5,000 sets of credentials, including accounts tied to over 20 US healthcare organizations. Subscribers paid as little as $12 a day to send thousands of phishing emails.",
      "Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit later shut down 338 related websites and identified Joshua Ogundipe from Nigeria as the operator. Investigators tied him to the phishing code and a crypto wallet that earned more than $100,000. Microsoft and Health-ISAC have since filed a lawsuit in New York that accuses him of multiple cybercrime violations.",
      "Other recent examples include kits like VoidProxy, Darcula, Morphing Meerkat and Tycoon2FA. QRR builds on these tools with automation, bot filtering and a dashboard that helps attackers run large campaigns fast.",
      "What makes QRR so effective",
      "QRR uses about 1,000 domains. Many are real sites that were parked or compromised, which helps the pages pass as legitimate. The URLs also follow a predictable pattern that can look normal to users at a glance.",
      "The kit includes automated filtering that detects bots. It sends scanners to harmless pages and sends real people to the credential-harvesting site. Attackers can manage campaigns inside a control panel that logs traffic and activity. These features let them scale up quickly without technical skill.",
      "Security analysts say organizations can no longer depend on URL scanning alone. Layered defenses and behavioral analysis have become essential for spotting threats that use domain rotation and automated evasion.",
      "Microsoft was contacted by CyberGuy for comment but did not have anything to add at this time.",
      "HACKERS FIND A WAY AROUND BUILT-IN WINDOWS PROTECTIONS",
      "Why this matters for Microsoft 365 users",
      "When attackers get your Microsoft 365 login, they can see your email, grab files and even send new phishing messages that look like they came from you. That can create a chain reaction that spreads fast. This is why the steps below all work together to block these threats before they turn into something bigger.",
      "Steps to stay safe from QRR and other Microsoft 365 phishing attacks",
      "Use these simple actions to shrink the risk from fake Microsoft 365 pages and look-alike emails.",
      "Take a second to look at who the email is really from. A slight misspelling, an unexpected attachment or wording that feels off is a big clue the message may be fake.",
      "Before you open any link, hover your mouse over it to preview the URL. If it does not lead to the official Microsoft login page or looks odd in any way, skip it.",
      "MFA adds an extra layer adds an extra layer that makes it much harder for attackers to break in even if they have your password. Use options like app-based codes or hardware keys so phishing kits cannot bypass them.",
      "Attackers often gather personal details from data broker sites to craft convincing phishing emails. A trusted data removal service scrubs your information from these sites, which cuts down on targeted scams and makes it harder for criminals to tailor fake Microsoft alerts that look real.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

    "story": [
      "Former White House chief information officer Theresa Payton joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how OpenTable is surveilling its users and Google's warning to VPN users about a recent security threat.",
      "Maybe you order sparkling water, start every meal with an appetizer or prefer dining right when the restaurant opens. You might not track these habits. OpenTable might.",
      "Some restaurants are now seeing new AI-assisted tags about diners when they book a table. These tags can note drink patterns, spending levels, review habits and last-minute cancellations.",
      "These insights surfaced after Kat Menter, a host at a Michelin-starred restaurant who posts about food under the name Eating Out Austin, spotted the new \"AI-assisted\" tags at work. She shared a look at the system in a TikTok video that quickly caught attention. Media outlets then confirmed the test with additional restaurants.",

      "WOULD YOU EAT AT A RESTAURANT RUN BY AI?",
      "The AI tags pull from reservation and POS data to highlight patterns like drink choices, spending ranges and dining habits across visits. (Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "How OpenTable gathers this information",
      "OpenTable integrates with POS (Point of Sale) platforms such as Toast or Epos. These systems handle orders, payments and timing during a meal. When your contact details match your OpenTable account, the platform can connect your visit to your profile.",
      "This can include arrival time, general order details, time spent and bill totals. Reporting shows that these items help OpenTable generate AI summaries of non-identifiable guest data when the restaurant uses a supported POS system and has enabled data sharing. You do not need to book through OpenTable for this to happen. You only need an account and matching contact information.",
      "Some users who pulled their data through OpenTable's privacy request form saw very limited information. Basic contact details and a list of past reservations were the main items. That suggests the insight level depends on which restaurants use POS integrations and how long they have used them.",
      "Why restaurants want these insights",
      "Restaurants have tracked guest preferences for years. Staff may note favorite dishes or preferred seating. They may watch for frequent lateness or recurring celebrations. This helps them shape a smooth visit.",
      "OpenTable's AI-summarized guest insights aim to offer a simplified version of these notes. They highlight drink categories, spending ranges or behavior patterns. However, Menter notes the tags can be off base. A single business dinner can mark someone as a high spender. Eating with friends who order cocktails can make a person look like a cocktail lover. Because of this, Menter treats the tags as loose suggestions rather than reliable signals.",
      "THAT'S NOT A HUMAN TALKING TO YOU IN THE FAST FOOD DRIVE-THRU",
      "How the AI works",
      "OpenTable says the AI does not process personal guest data. Instead, it is employed for high-level classification and categorization of large, anonymized data sets. For instance, the AI analyzes various point-of-sale descriptions (like \"glass of cabernet\") to consistently categorize them as \"red wine,\" \"white wine,\" etc., without ever interacting with specific guest profiles.",
      "The platform says these insights can help staff suggest dishes or set a relaxed pace. OpenTable also says the use of POS information depends on the privacy settings you choose, and you can review, adjust or opt out of data sharing at any time. Still, the privacy policy uses broad terms like dining preferences.",
      "A TikTok video from a Michelin-starred restaurant host first revealed the AI-assisted diner tags now being tested in OpenTable\u2019s Pro tools. (iStock)",
      "\"Guest insights are the engine of personalization, allowing restaurants to optimize their service and deliver the kind of thoughtful hospitality that both benefits the business and offers a special experience for the diner,\" an OpenTable representative told CyberGuy. \"These insights come from a mix of sources \u2014 including OpenTable, our restaurant partners, and POS partners \u2014 and are limited to non-confidential information.\"",
      "\"They might help a server suggest a dish you\u2019ll love or recognize that you prefer a more relaxed dining pace,\" the representative said. \"We also share these insights across our network so restaurants can learn and improve the hospitality experience for everyone, not just individual guests. You\u2019re in charge of what data you share. Through your OpenTable preferences and settings, you can review, adjust, or opt out of data sharing at any time. What we share with restaurants is guided by the choices you\u2019ve made in your privacy preferences.\"",
      "What data gets shared and how to limit it",
      "If a diner is opted in, OpenTable shares your name, contact details, party size and special requests with the restaurant you book. The company also confirms that participating restaurants share POS data with OpenTable. This can include items ordered, bill totals and how long you stayed. OpenTable then turns this into aggregated insights.",
      "RESTAURANT INSIDERS SHARE THE SECRETS OF SNAGGING HARD-TO-GET RESERVATIONS",
      "OpenTable reportedly shares insights across its broader restaurant network. This applies only where enabled and only for restaurants on the OpenTable Pro plan, and is a feature in Beta.",

These AI-assisted tags give restaurants extra insight, but they also remind you how much of your behavior gets logged behind the scenes. By checking your privacy settings and turning off POS data sharing, you keep more control over what follows you from one meal to the next. Staying aware makes a big difference. It helps you enjoy your night out without wondering who's tracking your habits or how your data might appear on a screen.

      "Security researcher Cody Kociemba uncovered this quiet data flow after digging into the backend as part of a repair bounty challenge run by FULU, a right-to-repair group cofounded by electronics repair expert and YouTuber Louis Rossmann. The challenge asked developers to restore lost smart features for unsupported Nest devices. Kociemba teamed up with the open-source community and created No Longer Evil, software that brings smart functionality back to these aging thermostats.",

      "Kociemba says the volume of logs was extensive. He turned off the incoming data because he never expected the devices to remain connected to Google after the shutdown.",
      "Google previously said unsupported models will \"continue to report logs for issue diagnostics.\" However, Kociemba points out that Google cannot use that data to help customers anymore because support is fully discontinued. That makes the continued data flow even more puzzling.",

      "\"The Nest Learning Thermostat (1st and 2nd Gen) is no longer supported in the Nest and Home apps, but temperature and scheduling adjustments can still be made directly on the unit. These devices will soon be unpaired and removed from all user accounts. Diagnostic logs, which are not tied to a specific user account, will continue to be sent to Google for service and issue tracking. Users who prefer to stop providing these logs can simply disconnect their device from Wi-Fi via the on-device settings menu.\"",
      "The thermostats continue reporting temperature, motion and light data even though official support has ended.",
      "Why this discovery matters",
      "Google cut access to remote control, security updates, software updates and status checks through the Nest and Google Home apps. Owners can no longer rely on the devices for key smart features. Yet the thermostats still push data to Google, creating a one-way connection that helps the company more than the customer.",
      "Users do not benefit from the logs because support has been discontinued. Google cannot use these logs to diagnose problems or offer help. That raises questions about transparency and user choice for people who assumed the connection ended.",

      "Start by checking what Google has linked to your home devices. Visit myactivity.google.com and look for thermostat logs or events you do not expect.",
      "A guest network keeps the thermostat away from your main devices. This limits what the thermostat can reach and helps prevent broader access.",
      "Some routers let you stop individual devices from sending data to the internet. This cuts off log uploads while still letting the thermostat control heating and cooling.",
      "If the device menu still offers cloud settings, turn off anything related to remote access or online diagnostics. Even partial controls help reduce data flow.",
      "Check your connected devices in your Google settings. Remove any old Nest entries that no longer serve a purpose. This stops leftover links that may still send data.",
      "Some routers send analytics back to the router maker. Turn off cloud diagnostics to reduce the footprint of unsupported smart products.",
      "Unsupported devices lose security updates. If you cannot isolate the thermostat on your network, consider upgrading to a model that still receives patches.",
      "Pro Tip: Reduce your footprint with a data removal service",

      "Smartphone banking has made life easier, but it has also opened new opportunities for cybercriminals.",
      "Over the past few years, we have seen Android malware steal passwords, intercept OTPs and even take remote control of phones to drain accounts. Some scams focus on fake banking apps, while others rely on phishing messages that trick you into entering sensitive details.",
      "Security researchers have now discovered a new threat that goes a step further. Instead of simply stealing login information, this malware gives thieves the ability to walk up to an ATM and withdraw your money in real time.",

      "Android malware like NGate tricks users into downloading fake banking apps that steal sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the NGate malware works",
      "The Polish Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT Polska) discovered a new Android malware called NGate that uses NFC activity to access a victim's bank account. This malware monitors contactless payment actions on the victim's phone and forwards all transaction data, including the PIN, directly to a server controlled by attackers. It does not just copy card details. Instead, it waits until the victim taps to pay or performs a verification step, then captures the fresh, one-time authentication codes that modern Visa and Mastercard chips generate.",
      "To pull this off, attackers need to infect the phone first. They typically send phishing messages claiming there is a security problem with the victim's bank account. These messages often push people to download a fake banking app from a non-official source. Once the victim installs it, the app walks them through fake verification prompts and requests permissions that allow it to read NFC activity. As soon as the victim taps their phone or enters their PIN, the malware captures everything the ATM needs to validate a withdrawal.",
      "MANAGE ANDROID APPS WITH THE NEW 'UNINSTALL' BUTTON",
      "Once installed, the malware captures NFC tap-to-pay codes and PINs the moment the victim uses their phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What attackers do with the stolen data at the ATM",
      "The attackers rely on speed. The one-time codes generated during an NFC transaction are valid for only a short period. As soon as the infected phone captures the data, the information is uploaded to the attacker's server. An accomplice waits near an ATM, holding a device capable of emulating a contactless card. This could be another phone, a smartwatch or custom NFC hardware.",
      "When the data arrives, the accomplice presents the card-emulating device at the ATM. Since the information contains fresh, valid authentication codes and the correct PIN, the machine treats it like a real card. The ATM authorizes the withdrawal because everything appears to match a legitimate transaction. All of this happens without the criminal ever touching the victim's physical card. Everything depends on timing, planning and getting the victim to unknowingly complete the transaction on their own phone.",
      "Criminals use the stolen, time-limited codes at an ATM to make real withdrawals without the victim\u2019s card. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from Android NGate malware",
      "As attacks like NGate become more sophisticated, staying safe comes down to a mix of good digital habits and a few simple tools that protect your phone and your financial data.",
      "Most malicious banking apps spread through direct links sent in texts or emails. These links lead to APK files hosted on random servers. When you install apps only from the Play Store, you get Google's built-in security checks. Play Protect regularly scans apps for malware and removes harmful ones from your device. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. Even if attackers send convincing messages, avoid installing anything from outside the official store. If your bank wants you to update an app, you will always find it on the Play Store.",
      "One careless tap on a fake bank alert can hand criminals everything they need. Strong antivirus software can stop most threats before they cause damage. It scans new downloads, blocks unsafe links and alerts you when an app behaves in ways that could expose your financial data. Many threats like NGate rely on fake banking apps, so having real-time scanning turned on gives you an early warning if something suspicious tries to install itself.",

      "Security patches fix vulnerabilities that attackers use to hijack permission settings or read sensitive data. Updates also improve how Android monitors NFC and payment activity. Turn on automatic updates for both the operating system and apps, especially banking and payment apps. A fully updated device closes many of the holes that malware tries to exploit.",
      "Phishing attacks often direct you to fake websites or fake app login pages that look identical to the real thing. A password manager saves your credentials and fills them in only when the website or app is authentic. If it refuses to autofill, it is a clear sign that you are on a fake page. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication gives you a second layer of protection, even if your password is compromised. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS codes because they cannot be intercepted as easily. For banking apps, enabling 2FA adds friction for attackers trying to perform unauthorized actions. Combined with strong passwords from a password manager, it significantly reduces the chance of account takeover.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency to trick you. They often claim that your card is blocked, your account is frozen or a payment needs verification. These messages push you to act fast and install a fake app. Always pause and check your bank's official channels. Contact the bank through verified customer care numbers or the official app. Never click links or open attachments in unsolicited messages, even if they look legitimate.",
      "Most people install apps and forget about them. Over time, unused apps pile up with unnecessary permissions that increase risk. Open your phone's permission settings and check what each app can access. If a simple tool asks for access to NFC, messages or accessibility features, uninstall it. Attackers exploit these excessive permissions to monitor your activity or capture data without your knowledge.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals are now combining social engineering with the secure hardware features inside modern payment systems. The malware does not break NFC security. Instead, it tricks you into performing a real transaction and steals the one-time codes at that moment. This makes the attack difficult to spot and even harder to reverse once the withdrawal goes through. The best defense is simple awareness. If a bank ever urges you to download an app from outside the Play Store, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Keeping your phone clean is now as important as keeping your physical card safe.",

Coming out of the conclave that elected him, he has placed a great emphasis on both unity and on peace.\"",
      "Lebanon marks the most emotionally charged part of the trip. The last papal visit came in 2012.

      "De Gance highlighted the significance of the commemoration. \"Pope Leo chose to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, which has such historic significance because this council helped define the reality \u2014 now still accepted by Protestants, Catholics and Orthodox \u2014 that Jesus Christ is truly God and truly man.\" He added, \"At the time of the council, a great many Christians had begun to reject this central apostolic truth.

      "In a loss for the Trump administration, an appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court ruling disqualifying Alina Habba from her position as acting U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey.",
      "In a 32-page ruling, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals found that Habba's appointment violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
      "Judge Michael Fisher wrote for the three-judge panel, \"It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,\" saying that the steps it took to install Habba run afoul of the law.",
      "The decision stems from motions from three criminal defendants who argued that President Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Habba, who had been overseeing their case, was unlawful, and that she should be disqualified and the cases against them dismissed.",
      "A lower court judge declined to dismiss their cases, but agreed Habba should be disqualified \u2014 and the appeals court agreed.",
      "Attorneys who challenged Habba's appointment praised the ruling in a joint statement.",
      "The decision affirms that \u201cHabba is unlawfully and invalidly serving as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey, marking the first time an appellate court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions,\u201d said the trio, Abbe Lowell, Gerry Krovatin and Norm Eisen.",
      "The White House referred a request for comment to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. The New Jersey U.S. attorney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Habba is a former personal lawyer to the president.",
      "A federal judge ruled in August that Habba\u2019s appointment was \u201cunlawful,\u201d though the judge\u2019s order was on hold as the legal proceedings continued in an appeals court.",
      "In the summer ruling, U.S. District Judge Matthew W. Brann took issue with Trump naming Habba as interim U.S. attorney in March, a position that is time-limited to 120 days. He said in his ruling that while Trump nominated her in June to serve as the permanent attorney, the Senate did not take up her nomination.",
      "Weeks after Trump nominated her to the permanent position, judges for the U.S. District Court of New Jersey appointed her deputy to be the new U.S. attorney. In response, Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the deputy, appointed Habba as \u201cSpecial Attorney to the Attorney General\u201d with all the powers of the U.S. attorney, and then appointed her to the deputy position, which allowed her to become the acting U.S. attorney again.",
      "The appeals court found that Bondi can't delegate all the power of the office to Habba with the special attorney appointment.",
      "\"This delegation theory would create a means for the Department of Justice to circumvent the FVRA\u2019s exclusivity provision, effectively permitting anyone to fill the U.S. Attorney role indefinitely. This should raise a red flag,\" the ruling said.",
      "The appeals court's decision comes just days after a federal judge dismissed criminal indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James after finding that acting U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, who was prosecuting the cases, was unlawfully appointed.",
      "U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie said last month that Halligan, another former Trump lawyer with no prior prosecutorial experience, \u201chad no lawful authority to present the indictment.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has commuted the seven-year sentence of former private equity CEO David Gentile days after he reported to prison, a White House official confirmed.",
      "Gentile was sentenced in May to seven years in prison on wire and security fraud charges. He began his sentence on Nov. 14 and was released on Nov. 26, Bureau of Prisons spokesman Donald Murphy said. The White House pardon czar, Alice Marie Johnson, also confirmed Gentile's release in a post on X.",
      "Gentile was the CEO and co-founder of GPB Capital Holdings and was convicted by a federal jury in August 2024 of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, which brought the indictment during the Biden administration, said at the time that the \"charges related to a years-long scheme to defraud more than 10,000 investors by misrepresenting the source of funds used to make monthly distribution payments and the amount of revenue generated by three of GPB\u2019s investment funds.\"",
      "Gentile was charged and convicted alongside Jeffry Schneider, the owner of a marketing firm, who prosecutors said marketed GPB funds to investors.",
      "The White House official disputed the charges brought by the Biden DOJ. The official said GPB paid regular annualized distributions to its investors and in 2015, the company \"disclosed to investors the possibility of using investor capital to pay some of these distributions rather than funding them from current operations.\"",
      "\"Even though this was disclosed to investors the Biden Department of Justice claimed this was a Ponzi scheme,\" the official said. \"This claim was profoundly undercut by the fact that GPB had explicitly told investors what would happen. At trial, the government was unable to tie any supposedly fraudulent representations to Mr. Gentile. Mr. Gentile also raised serious concerns that the government had elicited false testimony and failed to correct such testimony.\"",
      "Gentile's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his release.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James had also sued Gentile and other co-defendants in 2021 over the scheme. The lawsuit is still pending. A source familiar with James' case told NBC News that the attorney general\u2019s office is aware of Trump\u2019s commutation, and the source said it doesn\u2019t change the merits of the civil case against Gentile.",
      "Trump has granted pardons and other acts of clemency to hundreds of people since taking office in January, beginning with around 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants and including many people convicted of fraud since then",
      "In April, Trump pardoned Paul Walczak, who was convicted on tax charges. Walczak's mother contributed millions of dollars to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.",
      "In May, Trump pardoned and commuted the sentences of former reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Also in May, he pardoned former GOP Rep. Michael Grimm of New York, who was sentenced in 2015 to eight months on a tax fraud charge.",
      "In October, Trump released former GOP Rep. George Santos of New York from prison. Santos was serving a sentence of over seven years on wire fraud and identity theft charges.",
      "Later in October, Trump pardoned billionaire crypto executive Changpeng Zhao, who founded the Binance crypto exchange. Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison after pleading guilty in a deal with the Justice Department to enabling money laundering at Binance."

      "The World Health Organization on Monday recommended GLP-1 drugs as a tool to manage obesity in adults, marking a shift in the way the U.N. agency has historically framed obesity treatment.",
      "The WHO said that GLP-1 drugs can be part of a long-term treatment strategy that combines medication with counseling on healthy diets and physical activity. Previous WHO recommendations focused on the latter.",
      "WHO officials published the guidelines Monday in the medical journal JAMA, defining long-term use as continuous treatment for six months or more.",
      "\u201cGLP-1 therapies mark more than a scientific breakthrough,\u201d the officials wrote. \u201cThey represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity \u2014 from a \u2018lifestyle condition\u2019 to a complex, preventable, and treatable chronic disease.\u201d",
      "However, the guidelines also state that \u201cmedication alone cannot solve the global obesity burden.\u201d Genetics and environmental factors, such as rising stress levels or increased exposure to processed foods, likely contribute as well.",
      "The class of medications being recommended, known formally as GLP-1 agonists, can suppress a person\u2019s appetite by mimicking a hormone that signals to the brain when a person is full.",
      "The drugs exploded in popularity over the last few years as mounting evidence suggested they could help with weight loss and lower the risk of obesity-related conditions such as high blood pressure, heart attacks or strokes. In the U.S., 1 in 8 adults report that they\u2019re currently taking a GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition like diabetes, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank.",
      "WHO in September added GLP-1 drugs as a diabetes treatment to its list of essential medicines, but stopped short of adding them for obesity alone.",
      "The organization's new guidelines \u2014 crafted by a committee of obesity, pharmacology and public health experts \u2014 came at the request of WHO member states, the officials said. They follow the approval of GLP-1 drugs by several regulatory authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Many countries factor WHO guidelines into their health policies.",
      "The agency's recommendation is conditional, meaning the benefits likely outweigh the downsides but more evidence is needed. In the JAMA paper, WHO officials highlighted the need for more long-term data on the drugs\u2019 safety and efficacy, as well as lower prices to expand access.",
      "The most popular weight loss drugs in the U.S. \u2014 Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy \u2014 carry list prices above $1,000 per month. However, the Trump administration recently announced a deal with pharmaceutical companies that could lower the cost for people who pay out of pocket or have Medicare or Medicaid."

      "\u201cThis duffel is the ideal size for a quick weekend trip, and the padded material it\u2019s made from makes it comfortable to carry on your shoulder,\u201d says Rodriguez. \u201cThe front pocket is perfect for my 15-inch Macbook, and it has a separate compartment for a pair of shoes so they don\u2019t touch your clothes.\u201d In addition to the shoe compartment, Calpak\u2019s Luka Duffel, which fits under airplane seats, has a roomy main compartment and nine pockets to help you organize essentials. You can adjust its shoulder strap, and it\u2019s designed with a luggage sleeve.",
      "Dagne Dover Hunter Neoprene Toiletry Bag",
      "4.9-star average rating from 3,538 reviews at Dagne Dover",
      "I store my makeup and skin care in this toiletry bag while traveling, and it fits an impressive number of products inside. The bag has a flat bottom with a wide opening, making it easy to fill, and it comes with two removable mesh pouches to help you organize items. There\u2019s also a mesh slip pocket and three little elastic loops inside, the latter of which holds mascara and lip gloss, for example. It comes in small and large sizes (I highly recommend buying the large one), and is made from a water-resistant neoprene material.",
      "Best Cyber Monday fitness deals",
      "Alo Warrior Mat",
      "4.0-star average rating from 1,911 reviews at Alo",
      "Alo\u2019s Warrior Mat is the complete package in my book, and I\u2019ve relied on it during hot yoga, HIIT and pilates classes for years. It\u2019s cushioned enough to protect my body from the hard floor, but not too much that I feel unstable while standing on it. The mat also has a grippy, moisture-wicking surface to prevent sweat from pooling, so I never worry about slipping. It\u2019s oversized, giving me ample room to work out, and on the heavier side, which is one of my favorite parts about it \u2014 the Warrior Mat never moves around while I\u2019m jumping or running in place.",
      "Forme Power Bra",
      "4.6-star average rating from 5,946 reviews at Forme",
      "The Forme Power Bra, which I\u2019ve used for over a year, is part sports bra, part posture corrector. It\u2019s made with six tension fabrics and eight double-layered panels, both of which help train your upper body to hold itself upright, align the spine and roll the shoulders back, according to the brand. I find that the bra has a low to medium level of support, so I prefer wearing it to yoga, Pilates and barre classes.",

      "Luke Hemmings: \"No. 1 Obsession\" was the first one. And that was like, \"OK, this feels like it's ticking all the boxes.\" It felt very 5SOS, reclaiming back a bit of that punk rock, garage spirit, but had lyrics that felt very eye catching, even though it's ear catching, I guess.",
      "And that was the one to beat for a while. It felt like a nice blueprint to go from there, because it takes a minute to figure out what the next album's sounds going to be like. You're sort of stabbing in the dark for a while \u2014 especially after the last album had a very specific sound and feeling to it. We love challenging that on the next album, trying to totally 180-flip ... (and saying) what does it feel like if we did the opposite?",
      "LH: Sonically, it has a lot of dance elements in it, like New York and London, Cassius, Prodigy, those dancier acts that still feel like they have a rawness to them. And it's mixed (with a sound) only 5SOS could do; ironic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, but with lots of wisdom behind it. There's a little bit of social satire and self- deprecating humor in it. The sound is a mix of the pop rock, punk, garage band we started as, but mixed in with more dance element roots.",
      "That kind of sounds confusing as f---. (Laughs.) So I don't know.",
      "Michael Clifford: I don't think so.",
      "I think we're finally old enough \u2014\u00a0we're not old, sorry \u2014 we're young enough. We've been doing this for a minute, not too long, but we've been doing it for a little bit and we are able to understand a little bit more, just get perspective on things. I think that it was crucial for us to be able to have that perspective in order to make an album that has those types of themes in it.",
      "And like Luke said, trying to flip it on its head and trying to do the opposite of the last thing that we did, I think, was what we found so exciting about this.",
      "This has been the first time that we've really made an album knowing what we wanted it to look like and feel like in mind. We sort of had an idea of the theme and the feeling that we wanted this to evoke. So it made making it a lot easier and more inspiring. When you can see something in your head, sometimes it's more inspiring to get there because you're not shooting in the dark and like, \"I wonder what this is gonna be like?\" You kind of have an idea and you can drive the ship there.",
      "CH: It's definitely a cool feeling. These guys are kind of the only other three that can really resonate with my life's journey the last 15 years. I gain a lot of comfort from that. And it differs within our last albums, where a lot of the songs thematically come very personally. It's very personal-led, that's how we start songs. But this album felt more \u2014 there was a togetherness of the theme of the album and conceptually that felt really fresh and new. And there's definitely, subconsciously, a lot of healing from that, too.",
      "LH: I feel good. The last show we did, the \"Five Seconds of Summer Show,\" it felt like we unlocked our full evolution, or almost full evolution, as a band with mixing in the 10-year anniversary skits. It was more of treating it as an entertainment piece, as opposed to just ... (getting) out there and crank(ing) out some songs and play as a band. But it had multimedia and it was blurring the lines between the video and then the on-screen and onstage. It was really fun to do and it felt like the most \"us\" a show has been.",
      "So this time, because the characters that we have in this album, their egos are a bit more inflated, the show will reflect that. The people that have the big heads in \"Telephone Busy\" \u2014 those guys are making the show. They're behind the wheel and they're kind of crazy.",
      "MC: They've got some damage.",
      "LH: (Laughs.) It'll be like the 5SOS show we did but on steroids.",
      "MC: Not even steroids.",
      "LH: What's crazier than steroids?",
      "MC: Nothing that's appropriate to say on the TODAY show.",
      "CH: No, no, it's like Green Goblin-esque.",
      "LH: So if the Green Goblin was the fifth. Does that make any sense? (Laughs.)",
      "MC: I don't know. It's not as heady and narrative as that, but it sometimes made approaching concepts \u2014 and like Calum was saying \u2014 instead of going into the meaning of a song and being like, \"Do I personally resonate with this?\" It was more about like, \"Does my place within this story we're trying to tell, how do I embody that?\" Rather than trying to do anything that's too narratively driven. We always are going to be ourselves. We're just  ourselves in an alternate universe.",
      "LH: It's like the larger than life version of ourselves and we're back together. Especially after doing separate solo things, now together \u2014 we are like super, super 5SOS, I guess.",
      "CH: SuperSOS.",
      "MC: The conversation that we had behind it was like, we're our best, biggest versions of ourselves \u2014 well I'm the best, biggest version of myself when I'm doing my solo music \u2014\u00a0but also when I do the band's music. So they're the best versions of themselves when they're in the band.",
      "LH: This is a confusing read. (Laughs).",
      "CH: I agree, you're not your best version.",
      "MC: No, I said I am.",
      "LH: You're not your best version right now. (Laughs.)",
      "LH: We were telling people when we first started that we're going to be a band for 10, 15, 20, 30 years. And everyone, when you're 16 and 17, they're like, \"OK, cool,\" because usually the life cycle of a boy band is short. It's like a butterfly or something.",
      "MC: I think Ash has something to say as well.",
      "Ashton Irwin (mid-hair and makeup): What? ... Don't talk to me while I'm getting my makeup done.",
      "LH: You can legitimately quote that.",
      "I don't know if I'd tell (my younger self) anything. I'd just maybe, I'd just give him a soft drink. Maybe a cheeky pat on the back would be nice.",
      "CH: Maybe a foot-long Subway sandwich. Call it a day.",
      "LH: We've been telling people we're going to be a band for this long and I'm really happy that we stuck it out. We have a f------ amazing fan base that let us change and evolve and experiment with new sounds and looks and everything, and I still feel the same. And that's crazy to be some people's No. 1 obsession still. Sometimes I just feel like I'm a walking ghost.",
      "MC: Can I get a drink on the rocks?"

      "Elizabeth Taylor seemed larger-than-life on screen, and according to Neil Zevnik, her personal chef for nearly a decade in the \u201890s, she also threw larger-than-life parties at home.",
      "\u201cWe always did an enormous single table,\u201d Zevnik tells TODAY.com of her Thanksgiving dinners, attended by 40-plus guests at her ranch-style home in Bel Air, California. Formerly an actor, he worked as Taylor\u2019s chef from 1991 until 1999.",
      "Zevnik says, while he would typically only cook for her, holidays were a special case. As he prepared the feast, movers would remove all her furniture from her living and trophy rooms to make space for a square of banquet tables, which he says he also decorated.",
      "\u201cI would literally take off my shoes and have to get up there on the table,\u201d he says. \u201cI would do these very elaborate centerpieces with fabrics and vases of flowers and tchotchkes and candles.\u201d",
      "Taylor liked to seat all at the same table, he says, adding that kids, adults, celebrities and noncelebs all sat together, \u201cbecause then who gets to sit with her?\u201d",
      "For turkey day, Zevnik would prepare traditional fare: turkey, mashed potatoes, classic bread stuffing, cornbread sausage stuffing, sweet potato casserole, green beans, creamed pearl onions, fresh cranberry peach relish and a mince meat pie.",
      "\u201cYou know, she liked cranberry jelly out of the can, sliced,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cHer two favorite things for Thanksgiving would be turkey wings and gravy, and the turkey wings needed to be crispy and crunchy and salty, and she wanted several of them,\u201d Zevnik recalls. \u201cLots of gravy.\u201d",
      "Scroll to the bottom for his crispy turkey wing recipe.",
      "Taylor required her chef to make extra portions of those two dishes so there would be plenty to pile on her plate as well as leftovers.",
      "On days when she wasn\u2019t entertaining, Taylor\u2019s solo meals were casual \u2014 but never boring.",
      "\u201cGenerally, we wouldn\u2019t make a whole lot of plans in advance,\u201d Zevnik says. He would arrive to cook during the day and provide her options \u201cprepped to a certain point,\u201d as well as her favorites that he could easily whip up.",
      "\u201cAt some point, she\u2019d say, \u2018Okay, what do we got today?\u2019\u201d he says. He would ask her what she was in the mood for: salty, crunchy, creamy, healthy, etc. \u201cThen we would go from there.\u201d",
      "Every afternoon, Zevnik says Taylor would have him cook for everyone working at the house. \u201cAll the staff would gather and sit down together in the kitchen.\u201d",
      "Taylor was very open to trying new cuisines, but since she was brough up in the U.K., she especially loved British foods, like roast beef with Yorkshire pudding and Marmite.",
      "She was also a fan of sweets \u2014 in fact, she loved Zevnik\u2019s \u201ctoffee fudgies\u201d so much, she had a fridge stocked with them in her bedroom.",
      "Zevnik has since worked for a long list of celebrities \u2014 Reese Witherspoom, Jennifer Garner, Pierce Brosanan and Charlize Theron, to name a few \u2014 but those years with Taylor still inspire him.",
      "\u201cShe was one of the most loyal and giving people I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he says. She began her AIDS advocacy in the \u201880s, when most celebrities refused to help, and eventually established the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. \u201cShe didn\u2019t give a f--- what people thought. She did what she thought was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "When she disliked a stew he made, he recalls, she \u201ckind of ate a little bit of it, and then was kind of done.\u201d",

      "Brendan Fraser's new film, \u201cRental Family,\u201d explores belonging, authenticity\u00a0and one unconventional business model.",
      "The Oscar winner portrays Phillip, a struggling middle-aged American living in Tokyo taking a number of small gigs in hopes of getting another big break. He then gets an opportunity with a business that forever changes his life: a \"rental family\" agency.",
      "Essentially, actors like Philip get paid to play stand-in roles in strangers' lives. They can get hired to pose as family members, friends, partners, people whom they've had affairs with and now must apologize to their spouses, or whomever the client needs.",
      "\u201cRental Family\u201d is not based on a true story. However, it does bring to light the very real family rental businesses in Japan.",
      "Director Hikari tells TODAY.com that upon learning of the services, she discovered \u201cthat people are really longing for connection\u201d amid feelings of isolation.",
      "The film shows an initially hesitant Phillip after he gets hired as a stand-in-fianc\u00e9 for a woman who wants to stage a wedding so she can move to a different country with her female partner.",
      "He is also \u201cbooked\u201d to fill in the role of a long-lost father for a young girl named Mia (Shannon Mahina Gorman). Her, mother Hitomi (Shino Shinozaki), believes if her daughter has a complete family, her chances at being accepted into a prestigious school will be better.",
      "Then, the daughter of an aging Japanese actor, Kikuo (Akira Emoto), hires Philip to pose as a journalist and interview him before he loses his memory. While he pretends to write a story about the former star, they begin to form a friendship.",
      "In 2018, director Hikari began exploring the \u201crent-a-family industry\u201d and discovered that it started in the \u201880s.",
      "\u201cCurrently there are about 300 companies that exist in Japan,\u201d the director said in press notes. \u201cIn a big city like Tokyo, or even a countryside town, you can feel so isolated. \u2026 Every single person I spoke to was looking for connection. Even though they\u2019re paying for the service, they find a friendship within that two or three hours they spend together. And the actors who become the surrogates, they are also 100% invested in the relationship and find their own connection in the community. The roles may seem fake but the emotion is real.\u201d",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com, Hikari recalls the moment she knew rental services were \u201creally doing something very important to people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "There was a man that couldn\u2019t get in touch with his daughter for a long time, she says, \u201cand before he passed away, he really wanted to reconnect, but he couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo he hired somebody who looked like his daughter and asked her to come to the hospital so that he (could) apologize and say how much he loved her before he passed away,\u201d she says.",
      "Actor Mari Yamamoto, who portrays rental family agency employee Aiko, believes that people are looking for \u201ca temporary solution\u201d when they rent somebody.",
      "Telling TODAY.com, \u201cWhat starts out as a transactional relationship turns into something genuine. And I think that\u2019s the beauty of this service. The people that we\u2019ve spoken to who actually work in this industry have told us stories of how they get so much out of providing this service.\u201d",
      "Ryuichi Ichinokawa, founder of real life Heart Project business in Japan, told the Associated Press that he\u2019s hired dozens of people to pretend to be journalists for vacant events and people to pose as significant others and accompany them for special events or appointments, as well as pretend family members.",
      "\u201cI am being of service to people. I hope they will be happy,\u201d Ichinokawa told the publication, stressing that clients find the service comforting and healing. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I am acting. I really get angry if that\u2019s what the situation requires.\u201d",
      "Actor Takehiro Hira, who portrays Shinji, the owner of the rental family, calls the services a step to healing in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSometimes it becomes too much. Sometimes (they) just can\u2019t take it anymore. So rather than going to seek professional help... and you might be shy, then you can rent and use services like this to do the patchwork on the wound.\u201d",
      "Hira also spoke to someone who works at an agency and got a request from an older lady seeking the services of a younger person.",
      "\u201cJust to sleep in the next room so that she would feel safe and comfortable,\u201d the actor says. \u201cI have an 80-year-old some mother living by herself in Tokyo and she doesn\u2019t ask me to come back home. But maybe on some lonely night she might feel (scared), so that sort of puts everything in context.\u201d",
      "Miwa Yasui, a University of Chicago professor who also researches how culture influences mental health, told AP that Japan has grappled with loneliness, high suicide rates and mental illness stigma. Yasui noted that Japan as a collective culture tends to hide mental health challenges and adults are pressured to maintain harmony and take care of the family.",
      "Additionally, Chikako Ozawa-de Silva, author of \u201cThe Anatomy of Loneliness: Suicide, Social Connection and the Search for Relational Meaning in Contemporary Japan\u201d and a professor at Emory University, also told AP that the rental family business puts a \"band-aid\" on a deeper problem.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not against that,\u201d Ozawa-de Silva said. \u201cIf people can buy time by renting a family, while pursuing much better long-term solutions, I think the rental family could be a very, very beneficial thing.\u201d",
      "Hikari's goal was to make audiences ask themselves the role they would hire someone to play in their lives, as well as share a reminder to connect with real people.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to make a movie that connects the audience,\u201d she shares with TODAY.com. \u201cAnd have them look within themselves or pick up the phone and say, \u2018Hey, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d",
      "She also wanted people to understand the nuances of the business and how it could be interpreted in different countries.",
      "\u201cHere in America too, there are people who volunteer to be beside somebody who\u2019s elderly, who wants somebody to hold their hand and watch them go to the next journey,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very different but I think every culture has certain things that are (similar).\u201d",
      "What Hikari says is most \u201cbeautiful\u201d is that people just want \u201cto be there for each other.\u201d"

      "That is, measles is often the first disease to pop up when vaccination rates overall drop.",
      "\"When we see measles cases, it signals that gaps are almost certainly likely for other vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria or whooping cough or polio, even though they may not be setting off the fire alarm just yet,\" O'Brien said at a media briefing Monday, ahead of the release of the WHO's Progress Toward Measles Elimination report, published Friday in its Weekly Epidemiological Record.",
      "Indeed, whooping cough cases are also rising in the United States and are on track to be the most in a decade. More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.",
      "Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks.",
      "But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots.",
      "The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada met that threshold this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.",
      "Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a CDC report published in April.",

      "With an opposable big toe resembling a human thumb, the fossilized Burtele foot suggests its owner was a skilled climber, spending more time in the trees than Lucy, the study said.",
      "For decades, Lucy\u2019s species was considered the ancestor of all later hominids \u2014 an ancient relative more closely related to humans, including Homo sapiens, than to chimpanzees.",
      "Scientists were unable to confirm the foot belonged to a new species until they were able to study new fossils, including a jawbone with 12 teeth, that were found at the same site.",
      "After identifying them as Australopithecus deyiremeda, they found the Burtele foot belonged to the same species.",
      "John Rowan, an assistant professor in human evolution at Britain\u2019s University of Cambridge, said their conclusion was \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow we have much stronger evidence that, at the same time, there lived a closely related but adaptively distinct species,\u201d Rowan, who was not associated with the study, told NBC News in an email Thursday.",
      "The study also looked at how these species shared the same environment. The research team, led by Yohannes Haile-Selassie from Arizona State University, concluded that the new species spent much of its time in the forest.",
      "Lucy, or Australopithecus afarensis, likely roamed the ground, the study said, before going on to suggest that the two species likely had different diets and used the landscape in different ways.",
      "Multiple examinations of the newly found teeth indicated that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than Lucy and likely relied on a diet of leaves, fruit and nuts, the study said.",
      "\u201cThese differences meant that they were unlikely to be directly competing for the same resources,\u201d said Ashleigh L.A. Wiseman, an assistant research professor at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, which is also based at the U.K.\u2019s University of Cambridge.",
      "Highlighting the broader impact of this discovery on our understanding of evolution, Wiseman said in an email Thursday that the findings reminded us \u201cthat human evolution wasn\u2019t a straight ladder with one species turning into the next.\u201d",
      "Instead, she said, it should be viewed as a family tree with several so-called \u201ccousins\u201d alive at the same time, and each having a different way of surviving. \u201cDid they interact? We will likely never know the answer to that question,\u201d she added.",
      "Rowan also contended that as the number of well-documented human-related species grows, so do our questions about our ancestry. \u201cWhich species were our direct ancestors? Which were close relatives? That\u2019s the tricky part,\u201d he said. \u201cAs species diversity grows, so do the number of plausible reconstructions for how human evolution played out.\u201d",
      "And Wiseman cautioned against making definitive species assignments, as those should rest on well-preserved parts of skull and fossils that belong to multiple associated individuals. While the new research strengthens the case for A. deyiremeda\u2019s existence, she said, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t remove all other alternative interpretations.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 President Donald Trump has spoken with the leaders of U.S. ally Japan and rival superpower China amid the pair\u2019s escalating dispute over Taiwan.",
      "Trump\u2019s surprise call Monday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, was followed by a call with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who angered China earlier this month with comments on the Beijing-claimed island democracy.",
      "Both China and Japan said Trump initiated the calls, which the White House has not confirmed.",
      "The dispute began when Takaichi, who was elected last month, told lawmakers that a hypothetical Chinese attack on self-ruling Taiwan, which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory, could threaten Japan\u2019s survival and trigger a military response from Tokyo.",
      "It was the first time such an explicit remark had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, which like the United States has long been deliberately vague as to whether it would intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan.",
      "China, which describes Taiwan as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d has responded with outrage, taking the dispute to the United Nations, advising its citizens against traveling to Japan and seeking economic retaliation against Japanese seafood, movies, concerts and more.",
      "On Monday, China criticized Japan\u2019s plan to deploy missiles on an island near Taiwan as a deliberate attempt to \u201ccreate regional tension and provoke military confrontation,\u201d while Japan scrambled a fighter jet after it detected a Chinese drone flying between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Yonaguni.",
      "Though Takaichi has refused Beijing\u2019s demands that she retract her \u201cerroneous\u201d remarks, her government says Japan\u2019s policy on Taiwan has not changed and it continues to favor a peaceful resolution to the issue.",
      "Trump has not publicly commented on the dispute, though his ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has said Tokyo can count on U.S. support in the face of Chinese \u201ccoercion.\u201d",
      "Takaichi said Tuesday that she reaffirmed Japan\u2019s close cooperation with the U.S. in her call with Trump, which she said he initiated.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump mentioned that he and I are extremely good friends, and that I should call him any time,\u201d she told reporters, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during a visit to Japan last month, which was followed by a meeting with Xi in South Korea to address tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies over trade and other issues.",
      "Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d call with Xi, their first since that meeting, and that U.S.-China relations were \u201cextremely strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cNow we can set our sights on the big picture.\u201d",
      "Trump reaffirmed plans announced last month for him to visit Beijing in April, followed by a U.S. visit by Xi later in the year. He said he and Xi discussed Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and the illicit international flow of fentanyl ingredients. Taiwan was not mentioned in Trump\u2019s post.",
      "That is good news for Taiwan amid growing pressure from China and questions about Trump\u2019s commitment to its security, suggesting that \u201cfrom the U.S.\u2019 perspective, there is nothing about Taiwan that has changed,\u201d said Lev Nachman, a professor of political science at National Taiwan University.",
      "Xi also said the U.S. and China had \u201cgenerally maintained a steady and positive trajectory,\u201d according to a readout of the call published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the call was initiated by the U.S. side.",
      "Unlike Trump\u2019s post, the Chinese readout of the call heavily emphasized Taiwan, whose \u201creturn to China\u201d Xi said was an important part of the post-World War II international order.",
      "Taiwan, a former Japanese colony, was handed to the Republic of China government after Japan\u2019s defeat in 1945, only for that government to retreat to Taiwan a few years later after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong\u2019s communist forces. The island has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Taiwan Premier Cho Jung-tai said Tuesday that for the 23 million people of Taiwan, there was \u201cno option of returning\u201d to China.",
      "\u201cWe must once again emphasize that the Republic of China is a fully sovereign and independent nation,\u201d he told reporters in Taipei, using Taiwan\u2019s formal name.",
      "The Trump-Xi call is a \u201cvery good signal\u201d that the strategic competition between the U.S. and China is under control, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in China, though a \u201cdramatic breakthrough is hard to imagine.\u201d",
      "Taiwan has not been a major focus of U.S.-China relations in recent months, with Trump saying it \u201cnever came up\u201d during his meeting with Xi. The Chinese readout of their Oct. 30 meeting also failed to mention Taiwan, which is unusual.",
      "The Trump-Xi call comes after the U.S. announced two arms sales to Taiwan in the space of a week, the first since Trump returned to office in January. They include an advanced missile system worth almost $700 million and $330 million in fighter jet and other aircraft parts.",
      "China objects to such sales by the U.S., which has no official relations with Taiwan but is legally bound to provide the island with weapons for its defense.",
      "What China is seeking from Trump, Nachman said, is assurance that the U.S. is not going to loudly weigh in on the Taiwan dispute on Takaichi\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cFrom Beijing\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s important that other countries realize that there will be punishments for countries that take this pro-Taiwan stance,\u201d he said.",
      "The lack of comments from Trump on the issue, Nachman said, \u201ctells me that the U.S. has no desire to publicly make this about Taiwan more than it\u2019s already become.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe continuation of the trial is tearing us apart from within, provoking fierce divisions, intensifying divisions,\u201d he said. \u201cMy personal interest was and remains to continue the process until the end, until I am fully acquitted of all charges, but the security and political realities, the national interest, require otherwise.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu is facing charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. Prosecutors have alleged that he exchanged regulatory favors with media owners in Israel seeking positive press coverage.",
      "He has also been accused of accepting gifts \u2014 including cigars and champagne \u2014 in exchange for advancing the personal interests of Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. Prosecutors say these were worth hundreds of thousands of shekels. Milchan previously conceded in court that he gave \u201cexcessive\u201d gifts to Netanyahu, but neither he nor Packer are facing charges and both have denied wrongdoing.",
      "If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison for bribery and a maximum three-year term for each count of fraud and breach of trust.",
      "Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and the first sitting Israeli leader to have taken the stand as a criminal defendant, has consistently denied the allegations, branding them a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d A verdict in the ongoing five-year trial isn\u2019t expected until 2026 at the earliest, while Netanyahu will also have the option to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "Under Israel\u2019s Basic Law, the country\u2019s president has the power to pardon criminals or reduce their sentence. Pardons before a court verdict are extremely rare but not unheard of in Israel. Netanyahu made no admission of guilt in seeking a pardon, and continued to deny the charges as he made the request.",
      "A spokesperson for Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Netanyahu\u2019s request for a pardon was \u201cextraordinary,\u201d carrying with it \u201csignificant implications.\u201d",
      "Herzog is from a different political movement than Netanyahu, and relations between the two men have occasionally been strained.",
      "In accordance with \u201cguidelines and procedures,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s  request is \u201ccurrently being transferred to the Pardons Department in the Ministry of Justice which will gather the opinions of all the relevant authorities,\u201d read the statement, without indicating when a decision might be reached.",
      "In his video message, Netanyahu also cited Trump\u2019s recent appeal for the trial to be canceled, saying it would allow the two leaders to \u201cpromote more vigorously the vital interests shared by Israel and the United States in a window of time that is unlikely to return.\u201d",
      "Trump penned a letter to Herzog two weeks ago asking the president to grant Netanyahu a full pardon.",
      "At the time, Herzog\u2019s office had said that \u201canyone seeking a pardon must submit a request in accordance with the established procedures.\u201d",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir both immediately backed the proposed pardon on Sunday, with Katz citing the \u201ccomplex security reality\u201d in Israel.",
      "Netanyahu has previously cited the war in Gaza and security concerns while seeking delays in the court proceedings.",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid said that there should be no pardon without \"an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse, and an immediate withdrawal from political life.\"",
      "Benny Gantz, another political rival of Netanyahu\u2019s, said that the pardon request was \u201cfake\u201d and urged the leader: \u201cInstead of fanning the flames, extinguish the fire you created within Israeli society.\u201d",
      "In an unrelated case, the International Criminal Court last year issued a warrant for Netanyahu\u2019s arrest over alleged war crimes committed in Gaza.",
      "Both Israel and the U.S. do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC. The warrant theoretically puts Netanyahu at risk of arrest if he steps foot in an ICC member country, though the body has no police force and is reliant on international cooperation.",
      "Israel responded furiously to the warrants, with Netanyahu\u2019s office branding the decision as \u201cantisemitic\u201d and rejecting the charges as \u201cabsurd and false.\u201d"

Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant, echoed Bociurkiw\u2019s concerns, saying that Yermak\u2019s resignation, just days before major U.S.-Ukraine-Russia talks and a potential Trump-Putin summit, \u201cdisrupts Kyiv\u2019s preparations and invites counterparts to probe whether Ukraine\u2019s red lines on territory and NATO can be eased during the transition.\u201d",
      "But in the long term, Horowitz told NBC News on Saturday, Yermak\u2019s departure could even be a positive.",
      "Critics have said for years that Yermak had accumulated too much power and wielded excessive influence over Zelenskyy. A constant presence by the president\u2019s side through the ups and downs of the war, Yermak had emerged as one of the few men that the Ukrainian leader appeared to really trust.",
      "Zelenskyy has previously railed against corrupt officials, but signs that a corruption scandal may have stretched into his inner circle may provide more ammunition to critics of further support for Ukraine. Trump-aligned figures, including Vice President JD Vance, have previously criticized Ukraine for its issues with corruption.",
      "Yermak\u2019s departure may \u201creinforce skepticism within the Trump administration\u201d about Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle, giving them further reasons to push for concessions, said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "But Horowitz said the resignation \u201cremoves a lightning rod for controversy and gives Kyiv a cleaner, more collective mandate to say no to an unfair and unsustainable peace,\u201d adding: \u201cZelenskyy is getting his house in order.\u201d",
      "When it comes to how the rule of law is being enforced in Ukraine, \u201cgenerally this is a good sign,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s bad enough that these accusations existed in the first place,\u201d he added, but \u201ceven those in the highest places are prosecuted when suspicions arise.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said in a video statement on Friday that he was looking for Yermak\u2019s replacement. \u201cRussia really wants Ukraine to make mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no mistakes on our part.\u201d",
      "Losing unity could mean losing the country and its future, he added.",
      "But Bociurkiw said time is \u201cnot on Ukraine\u2019s side right now.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re Ukraine at the moment, he added, \u201cyou need not only a physical army, but an army of diplomats and advocates.\u201d"

      "\u201cAlso, the land is easier, but that\u2019s going to start very soon,\u201d the president added, speaking from his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "For months, the president has intensified the United States\u2019 military presence in the region, ramping up pressure on Venezuela with strikes on alleged drug boats since early September. The military has carried out nearly two dozen known strikes on vessels that officials said were carrying drugs, killing at least 82 people.",
      "The USS Gerald R. Ford, a major aircraft carrier, arrived in the Caribbean last week, rounding out a buildup of U.S. military forces in the region that has not been seen for decades.",

      "It was not clear exactly which other countries Trump was referring to, with the phrasing used in the past to refer to poorer nations.

      "The rolling plains of Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara and the millions of animals that live there face a shiny new intrusion: a gleaming Ritz-Carlton safari camp.",
      "With private plunge pools, butler service and panoramic views commanding more than $5,000 a night, the 20-hectare lodge has become a luxury lightning rod for controversy.",
      "Leaders of the Maasai \u2014 an ethnic group of traditionally nomadic herders with ancestral ties to the area \u2014 and conservationists warn the new tourist destination threatens a migration corridor vital to the movement of vast numbers of animals and have filed a lawsuit to halt its operations.",
      "What's at stake, they argue, is not just a new lodge, but the accelerating pressures of tourism on wildlife, biodiversity and the very spectacle that draws these tourists in the first place.",
      "The camp opened on Aug. 15 during the height of the Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebras and other grazing animals move back and forth between the Serengeti plains in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) in Kenya, a process that researchers say allows animals to find food and water and maintain genetic diversity among herds.",
      "Tourists have long flocked to the savannah by the hundreds of thousands, hoping to witness one of the largest movements of mammals in the world, as herds cross rivers and plains teeming with predators.",
      "But the new camp, which boasts \u201cfront-row seats to one of the world's greatest natural wonders\u201d on its website, may threaten the migration that visitors come to witness, conservations and Maasai leaders say.",
      "The Ritz-Carlton camp, on a bend in the Sand River, sits on \u201cone of the most favored corridors for these animals,\u201d Maasai elder Meitamei Olol Dapash told NBC News in an interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cAny guide will tell you, that is the crossing they use,\u201d said Dapash, who filed a lawsuit in August in a Kenyan court against Ritz-Carlton's owner, Marriott International, the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, as well as the project\u2019s local owner and operator, Lazizi Mara Limited, and Kenyan authorities.",
      "Dapash, executive director of the Institute for Maasai Education, Research and Conservation (MERC), who has a PhD in Sustainability Education from Prescott College in Arizona, alleges in the lawsuit that the 20-suite camp obstructs the crucial migration corridor and is asking the court to restore the land to its original condition.",
      "He told NBC News in an interview there had been instances of wildebeest turning back to avoid the camp and that an elephant was seen struggling to find a path across the river after using the location for more than a decade.",
      "\u201cAttachment to the land and to the wildlife exists up to this very day,\u201d Dapash said, adding that the Maasai had seen populations dwindling. The new camp, he added, \u201cwas the last straw for us, we just didn\u2019t want to let this happen.\u201d",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service government agency pushed back at claims the lodge has impacted wildebeest migration, citing monitoring data that it says shows it does not \u201cfall within, obstruct, or interfere with any wildebeest migration corridors\u201d and adding that migrating wildebeest \u201care using the entire breadth of the Kenya-Tanzania border.\u201d",
      "It said that \"all ecological, environmental and regulatory requirements were thoroughly met and validated.\"",
      "Marriott International told NBC News that the development underwent an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \u201cin full compliance with\u201d Kenya's environmental protections.",
      "The company said it is committed to \u201cthe principles of responsible tourism\u201d but declined to comment on Dapash's claims that the Ritz-Carlton blocked a key route for local wildlife or its own steps to mitigate the construction's impact, saying these were matters for Narok County, which manages the reserve on the Maasai\u2019s behalf.",
      "Narok County did not respond to NBC News' request for comment. In court documents seen by NBC News, the county claims that the safari camp complies with the Maasai Mara Management Plan, which imposes a moratorium on new developments amid concerns that poorly regulated tourism was stifling wildlife migration and threatening the reserve\u2019s ecosystem.",
      "Lazizi Mara Limited said the moratorium is part of the case before the court, adding: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t\u202fwant to comment on\u202fissues\u202fthat are pending determination.\u201d",
      "Dapash told NBC News that he had \"no issue with business, but this is not just about hotel, it is about the long-term survival of the game reserve.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel like we are losing the land, we are losing the wildlife,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid mounting concerns about the health of the 580-square-mile reserve, where tourist numbers have nearly tripled in recent decades. The Maasai Mara National Reserve reported over 300,000 tourists in 2023. In 1980, total visitor entry was 114,000.",
      "Tourism in the Mara generates an estimated $20 million annually and thousands more indirectly, according to the reserve. In 2023, tourism across the country contributed around 7% of Kenya's gross domestic product, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.",
      "But the rapid growth in lodges and camps has sometimes clashed with conservation efforts.",
      "\u201cA hotel is never just a hotel,\u201d Dr. Chloe Buiting, a vet and wildlife researcher working in the Maasai Mara, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s infrastructure, it\u2019s roads, it\u2019s changes to the water and the resources and the use of land.\u201d",
      "Seasonal variation in the availability and quality of food forces animals to move around, said Joseph Ogutu, a Kenyan researcher at the University of Hohenheim in Germany. But he said developments like the Ritz-Carlton are having \u201ca negative effect on migration, because most of these facilities are close to rivers where animals either drink water or breed or seek refuge.\u201d",
      "Dapash's cause has also found support among experts and tourism groups.",
      "Grant Hopcraft, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Glasgow, who has been collaring migratory wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara since 1999, presented maps and data to the court in October showing \u201cregular cross-border movement of wildebeest\u201d at the location of the lodge, according to his affidavit.",
      "RIDE International, a U.S.-based nonprofit providing cultural exchanges and immersive tours in East Africa, has also thrown its support behind Dapash's lawsuit.",
      "The Mara has been suffering for a long time, said Riley Jon Blackwell, the company's executive director, with \u201clarge hotel chains coming in and trying to service the luxury guests who command to see the best of the best for wildlife.\u201d",
      "The Ritz-Carlton safari camp was \u201cnot surprising,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a culmination of a long time, of a direction of things leading this way.\u201d",
      "The camp holds a 2.2-star rating on Google Reviews, with many posters criticizing its environmental impact. Others have praised their stay at the park.",
      "A court is scheduled to hear the case in December.",
      "If Dapash is successful with his lawsuit, Buiting said it could \u201cset a very interesting precedent\u201d for future developments in the reserve.",
      "\u201cFrom a legal perspective, this could actually be groundbreaking, a turning point,\u201d she added."

      "Asked for details on which countries are considered \u201cof concern,\u201d USCIS pointed to a June presidential proclamation listing 19 countries \"considered deficient with regards to screening and vetting.\" Afghanistan is one of the countries on the list, which also includes Haiti, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "The USCIS announcement comes a day after two National Guard members were shot near the White House. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds, Trump said Thursday night, while 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe remained hospitalized in critical condition. They were in Washington as part of Trump\u2019s deployment of federal troops to several U.S. cities.",
      "Federal prosecutors say the suspect, an Afghan national who once assisted American forces, was resettled in the U.S. under a program called Operation Allies Welcome during the Biden administration following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Thursday morning that her office is reviewing the suspect\u2019s immigration history and the vetting process that allowed his entry into the country.",
      "In a long post on X Friday, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Joe Kent claimed that 85,000 Afghans were admitted to the U.S. under Biden without the \u201crigorous vetting that has protected us in the past.\u201d",
      "He continued, saying that the suspect was \"only vetted to serve as a soldier to fight against the Taliban, AQ, & ISIS IN Afghanistan, he was NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen.\"",
      "Those admitted under the Operation Allies Welcome program were required to undergo \"biometric and biographic screenings\" by law enforcement and counterterrorism authorities, according to a fact sheet prepared by the Biden administration.",
      "The suspect's immigration process continued into the Trump administration. He was granted asylum in April of this year, which typically occurs two weeks after a final interview with immigration authorities.",
      "In a video released by the White House, Trump called the attack in Washington, D.C., an \u201cact of terror\u201d and said additional National Guard troops would be deployed to the nation's capital.",
      "The administration said shortly after Trump's remarks that all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals will be halted indefinitely.",
      "Authorities have not provided a motive, but D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said \u201cthis is a targeted shooting,\u201d and that the suspect appeared to target the guard members.",
      "Four senior law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation said the suspect has been identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "Speaking with NBC News on Wednesday, a relative of Lakanwal said he arrived in the U.S. in September 2021 after serving in the Afghan Army for 10 years, alongside U.S. Special Forces. Lakanwal was living in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five children, the relative said.",
      "\u201cWe were the ones that were targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan,\u201d said the relative. \u201cI cannot believe it that he might do this.\u201d",

      "Asked Thursday night about Lakanwal's vetting and the fact that he worked with the CIA, Trump responded: \"He went cuckoo. I mean, he went nuts. And that happens too, it happens too often with these people,\" an apparent reference to Afghans who came to the U.S. around the time of the 2021 withdrawal."

      "The hills are alive with the sound of compromise, as three unlikely rebel nuns have been offered a chance to remain in their former convent in Austria \u2014 as long as they give up their Instagram habit.",
      "Sister Bernadette, 88, Sister Regina, 86, and Sister Rita, 82, were the last nuns in residence at the Goldenstein Castle convent near Salzburg, where they had spent decades living until their removal for medical reasons in 2023.",
      "The nuns, who said they had been sent to a Catholic nursing home against their will, captured global attention in September when they ran away from care and broke back into their vacant former home with the help of a locksmith, local residents and former students.",
      "\u201cI am so pleased to be home,\u201d Sister Rita had told the BBC at the time. \u201cI was always homesick at the care home. I am so happy and thankful to be back.\u201d",
      "Ever since, they have documented daily life at the former convent on Instagram, with videos capturing a few of their favorite things, from candlemaking to boxing lessons.",
      "Church officials accused the nuns of breaking their vow of obedience during a standoff over their future, but on Friday a statement said they would be offered a chance to remain at the former convent \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d",
      "Provost Markus Grasl of Reichersberg Abbey, the nuns\u2019 superior, said that while he believed it was best for them to receive \u201ccomprehensive care in a nursing home,\u201d he would take their wishes on board and allow them to stay at the convent, provided they return to a \u201cstructured religious life.\u201d",
      "Under Grasl\u2019s plan, the nuns would return to a \u201ccloistered monastic life\u201d away from the public eye and the volunteers who have been providing them support, with priests instead called in to help them and a doctor on hand for \u201cnecessary medical care.\u201d",
      "He cited the Christian principle of mercy with respect to \u201csome of the sisters\u2019 actions\u201d in the past few weeks, and said that donations received for them, as well as funds earmarked for the sale of a book about them, should be given to a mission project.",
      "But a post on the nuns\u2019 Instagram page said they would not immediately agree to the proposal.",
      "The stipulation that the sisters would be allowed to remain in the convent \u201cuntil further notice\u201d made the plan \u201clegally worthless,\u201d a statement issued on their behalf said.",
      "The trio told Austrian outlet Kronen Zeitung that attempts to silence them were \u201claughable\u201d and said: \u201cWe will certainly not accept this agreement.\u201d",
      "Their legal representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "The provost\u2019s spokesman, Harald Schiffl, told Austria\u2019s public broadcaster ORF that a deal would be good for all parties. He said that \u201cwhat is conveyed on social media is not truly the reality of monastic life.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The inferno that tore through a high-rise housing estate in Hong Kong has killed at least 128 people, authorities said Friday, with some 200 people still missing and eight more arrested.",
      "Firefighters combing each apartment in the Wang Fuk Court tower complex found dozens more bodies, officials said at a news conference Friday as smoke from the blaze was still drifting in the air well over 48 hours since it broke out.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s Secretary for Security Chris Tang told reporters Friday that 89 bodies could not yet be identified. Seventy-nine people were injured, he said. Tang declined to identify the genders and ages of the deceased, saying the investigation was ongoing and the data incomplete.",
      "But he insisted there was \u201cnothing the government is not willing to release,\u201d and officials were \u201cmore than happy\u201d to roll out relevant details at an appropriate time.",
      "The deadliest blaze in the Chinese territory in seven decades has nonetheless fueled calls for greater accountability and transparency from the local government over potential regulatory negligence.",
      "Residents in Wang Fuk Court have said they repeatedly complained to the city\u2019s Labor Department about the flammability of the protective green mesh that was used to cover bamboo scaffolding raised around the buildings, only to be told that the fire risk was relatively low, Reuters reported Friday.",
      "Cindy, who declined to give her full name for privacy reasons, told NBC News on Thursday that she grew up in Wang Fuk Court and felt \u201cvery sad\u201d and \u201chelpless\u201d to see it completely burned down. The 48-year-old said her family had managed to escape, adding, \u201cI really hope there are survivors. I\u2019m wishing for a miracle to happen.\u201d",
      "Tang said preliminary findings suggested the fire started in netting surrounding the lower floors at Wang Cheong House, one of the seven affected towers at the Wang Fuk Court building complex.",
      "Styrofoam on the windows, which was \u201chighly flammable,\u201d fueled the blaze to spread rapidly upward and extend to six more buildings, he said, adding that the flames shattered glass and penetrated interiors, burning both inside and outside the buildings simultaneously.",
      "The intense heat then ignited the bamboo scaffolding, which also sparked secondary fires when it fell down, he said.",
      "\u201cAlthough the mesh netting met certain flame-retardant requirements, they could still catch fire when exposed to high temperatures,\u201d Tang said. \u201cBamboo scaffolding could also catch fire,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are only flame-retardant. And this is our initial assessment of the situation.\u201d",
      "Within hours, Hong Kong\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption said in a statement that it had set up a \u201ctask force to launch a full investigation into possible corruption\u201d and eight people had been arrested including \u201cconsultants, scaffolding subcontractors and middleman.\u201d",
      "It came after police on Thursday searched the offices of Prestige Construction and Engineering Co., the registered contractor hired to carry out the renovations. Officers also arrested two directors and an engineering consultant on suspicion of manslaughter.",
      "Calls to the company by NBC News went unanswered.",
      "The cause of the fire also remains under investigation, which may take three to four weeks to complete, officials said at the Friday news briefing. Rescuers faced significant difficulties during operations due to the extremely high ambient temperatures reaching or sometimes exceeding 500 degrees Celsius, they added.",
      "Additionally, the fire alarms in all eight blocks didn\u2019t sound off when the blaze broke out, Andy Yeung, the director of Hong Kong\u2019s Fire Services, told reporters.",
      "Yeung\u2019s department said Wednesday that Ho Wai-ho, one of the first firefighters on the scene, died in the hospital after he was found collapsed at the scene. The 37-year-old had suffered burns to his face.",
      "Another 12 firefighters were injured and one was in critical condition after suffering a heat stroke, Hong Kong\u2019s Fire Services added Friday."

      "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Pope Leo XIV touched down in the conflict-ridden Middle East on the first international trip of his papacy, urging peace and hoping to help the Catholic Church heal centuries-old divisions with other religions and denominations.",
      "As his fellow countrymen celebrate Thanksgiving, the first American pontiff\u2019s plate will be full on a six-day tour of Turkey and Lebanon that will be closely scrutinized. He plans to meet with religious and political leaders, lead Mass in both countries and try to provide a boost to long-suffering Christian communities throughout the region.",
      "Ahead of his trip, Leo shared a Thanksgiving message with NBC News in which he encouraged all people \u201cto say \u2018thank you\u2019 to someone\u201d and \u201cto recognize that we have all received so many gifts, first and foremost the gift of life.\u201d",
      "Gifts were shared aboard his flight to the Turkish capital, Ankara, including a pecan pie handed to him by an NBC News correspondent. Leo told journalists that along with other church leaders, he hoped \u201cto announce, transmit, proclaim how important peace is throughout the world and to invite all people to come together to search for greater unity.\u201d",
      "Later, in his first overseas speech since his election in May to lead the 1.4 billion-member church, Leo told Turkish political leaders that the world was experiencing \u201ca heightened level of conflict on the global level, fueled by prevailing strategies of economic and military power.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must in no way give in to this,\u201d he added. The future of humanity is at stake.\u201d",
      "Some had speculated that the Chicago-born Leo might choose the U.S. for his first trip, or Peru, where he served for many years as a missionary and later as a bishop and archbishop, becoming a naturalized citizen in 2015.",
      "But for Miles Pattenden, a Catholic Church historian at the U.K.\u2019s University of Oxford, the choice of the Middle East was \u201cnot such a surprise,\u201d and it was sending out a message that the region \u201cis the heart of Christianity.\u201d",
      "Turkey, where Leo will stay until Sunday, was the \u201cobvious choice\u201d because it was the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, Christianity\u2019s first ecumenical council, Pattenden told NBC News in a telephone interview Wednesday.",
      "Convened by Emperor Constantine, who made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, the meeting of bishops and church leaders \u201cproduced the Nicaean creed, which is the standard statement of what Christians believe,\u201d including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God, Pattenden said.",
      "He added that it was \u201cabsolutely foundational\u201d to what Christians, including Catholics, believe today.",
      "Leo will pray with the spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, at the site of the 325 A.D. gathering in what is known today as Iznik, before they sign a joint declaration in a sign of Christian unity.",
      "\u201cWe all understand that 1,000 years of division has inflicted a deep wound that cannot be healed easily,\u201d Bartholomew told the respected Greek daily Kathimerini recently, according to The Associated Press."
