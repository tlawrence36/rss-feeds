      "A 1940 self-portrait by Frida Kahlo, titled \u201cEl sue\u00f1o (La cama),\u201d could make auction history Thursday at Sotheby\u2019s in New York",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A 1940 self-portrait by famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo of her asleep in a bed could make history Thursday when it goes on sale by Sotheby\u2019s in New York.",
      "With an estimated price of $40 million to $60 million, \u201cEl sue\u00f1o (La cama)\u201d \u2013 in English, \u201cThe Dream (The Bed)\u201d \u2014 may surpass the top price for a work by any female artist when it goes under the hammer. That record currently stands at $44.4 million, paid at Sotheby\u2019s in 2014 for Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s \u201cJimson Weed/White Flower No. 1.\u201d",
      "The highest price at auction for a Kahlo work is $34.9 million, paid in 2021 for \u201cDiego and I,\u201d depicting the artist and her husband, muralist Diego Rivera. Her paintings are reported to have sold privately for even more.",
      "The painting up for auction depicts Kahlo asleep in a wooden colonial-style bed, wrapped in a golden blanket embroidered with crawling vines and leaves. Above her, seemingly levitating atop the bedposts, lies a full-sized skeleton.",
      "In its catalog note, Sotheby's said the painting \u201coffers a spectral meditation on the porous boundary between sleep and death.\u201d",

      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",
      "\u201cThe suspended skeleton is often interpreted as a visualization of her anxiety about dying in her sleep, a fear all too plausible for an artist whose daily existence was shaped by chronic pain and past trauma,\u201d the catalog notes.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- On the frozen edge of the world, staying in practice as a professional musician takes ingenuity, grit and a plastic instrument for schoolchildren that\u2019s guaranteed not to freeze to your fingers or face.",
      "Natalie Paine is a French horn player in New Zealand\u2019s navy who since October has been among 21 military members stationed in Antarctica. There, her melodies drift across the frozen Ross Sea from perhaps the most remote practice room on Earth.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and very inspiring,\u201d Paine told the Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019ll sit there by the window and I will do my routine and play music in my time off, which is not very often.\u201d",
      "The story of how she arrived in Antarctica is an unlikely one. Paine grew up in the hot, dry climate of Adelaide, Australia, where she dreamed of visiting the frozen continent as a scientist.",
      "She studied music at university instead, putting Antarctica out of her mind. Years later however, as a musician in New Zealand\u2019s navy, Paine learned members of the country\u2019s military were stationed in Antarctica to support the work of scientists.",
      "When she asked, her instructor said any military member could win one of the coveted assignments.",
      "\u201cMy eyes lit up and I was like, what? Even a musician?\u201d Paine said. \u201cHe\u2019s like, heck yeah, why not?\u201d",
      "Her dream was revived but enacting it wasn\u2019t simple. It took four years of unsuccessful applications before Paine landed a posting as a communications operator.",
      "It\u2019s a consuming job, worked in six-day stretches that leave little time for music. Paine monitors radio, phone, email and other communications traffic at New Zealand\u2019s mission at Scott Base, sometimes speaking to people on the ice who haven\u2019t heard other voices for weeks.",
      "In whatever window she can find, Paine squeezes in scales and mouth exercises, going to great lengths not to disturb others on round-the-clock shifts. That means slipping out of the main base to a hut built in 1957 under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary as New Zealand established its presence in Antarctica.",
      "While she plays by the window, watching seals on the ice, Paine finds new musical motifs bubbling up.",

      "In some ways, it echoed 2023's award show, where Wilson took home five trophies including entertainer of the year.",
      "But it wasn't just Lainey celebrating at the 59th annual CMA Awards, which aired live from Nashville\u2019s Bridgestone Arena.

      "George Clooney stars in \"Jay Kelly,\" a film by Noah Baumbach that blurs reality and fiction, says Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy",
      "During his glittering career, George Clooney has played a casino thief, a Batman,a chain-gang convict, an assassin and a high-flying layoff artist. This fall, he's stretching even more, playing an utterly charming and gorgeous movie star. Kidding!",
      "Reality and fiction beautifully weave in and out in \u201cJay Kelly,\u201d director Noah Baumbach's love letter to Hollywood that, in other hands, could so easily have become just a love letter to Clooney.",
      "The script by Baumbach and Emily Mortimer finds Clooney \u2014 sorry, Jay Kelly \u2014 in a sort of midlife funk. He's 60, a universally beloved, deeply earnest movie hunk who has worked his way to the top and found, well, artifice.",
      "\u201cMy life doesn't really feel real,\u201d he says at one point, an actor trained in pretending going meta playing an actor trained in pretending. In another scene he muses: \u201cAll my memories are movies.\u201d",
      "A chance meeting with an old acting partner \u2014 a brilliant Billy Crudup, whose character was betrayed by Kelly years ago \u2014 reveals some unpleasant truths. \u201cIs there a person in there? Maybe you don\u2019t actually exist,\u201d he asks the star, sending Kelly on a journey of self-discovery that just so happens to lead to one of Clooney's favorite places, Italy.",
      "Kelly's careful facade \u2014 the stories he tells about himself \u2014 soon gets chipped away. On his way up the hills of Hollywood, he apparently left some personal carnage behind. \u201cJay Kelly\u201d is about those who sacrificed to get him there.",
      "Adam Sandler and Laura Dern play Kelly's long-suffering manager and publicist, respectively, while his resentful adult daughters are portrayed by Grace Edwards and Riley Keough. Kelly, we learn, put career first and that meant walking away from things like his daughters' school recitals and making his staff miss things like their daughters\u2019 school recitals. \u201cHe's not our family or our friend,\u201d Dern's character screams in despair. \u201cWe're not to him what he is to us.\u201d",
      "You'd expect Clooney to not have to shift out of second gear for this, but he gives a soulful performance, charming enough that his Kelly seduces a trainful of strangers in Italy with his aw-shucks charisma and yet also bristles when his oldest daughter makes him confront her abandonment issues.",
      "\u201cDo you know how I knew you didn't want to spend time with me?\u201d his daughter asks him, before answering in a line that will land like a gut punch with any parent: \u201cBecause you didn't spend time with me.\u201d Another killer: \u201cI wish you were the man I thought you were.\u201d",

      "Kelly melts into past vignettes like watching his own long-ago breakout drama audition and his kids' joyous household revelry. It reaches for the surreal in a mist-filled forest and finds redemption in, of course, a movie theater. A retrospective montage uses such real Clooney roles like \u201cCombat Academy\u201d and \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d further blurring the line between fact and fiction.",

      "The petition for habeas corpus filed with California's 2nd District Court of Appeal argues that lawyer Philip Cohen did not represent Masterson properly at the 2023 retrial that ended with the actor being convicted of raping two women at his Los Angeles home in 2003. He was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.",
      "The petition also argues that the trial judge demonstrated a bias against the Church of Scientology, allowing an \u201cunconstitutional intrusion\u201d into the church's doctrine and a misinterpretation of its scripture.",
      "Masterson is a member of the church, whose practices were a major issue at his trial, and the women are former members.",
      "The petition says that Cohen spoke to only two of the 20 potential witnesses brought to his attention by his co-counsel and an investigator. It says the witnesses included some who would have testified that the women spoke favorably of the sexual relationships they had with Masterson. And they included psychological and pharmacological experts who would have testified about the effects of alcohol and drugs on memory.",
      "The court filing says there was \u201cunexpected and unreasonable failure of trial counsel to present any of the mountain of exculpatory evidence\u201d that had been amassed by Masterson's pretrial attorney Shawn Holley, and the result was a violation of his constitutional rights.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine F. Olmedo declined to delay Masterson\u2019s first trial to accommodate Holley\u2019s representation of former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer against his own allegations of sexual misconduct. Cohen then took over as lead attorney.",
      "Masterson's first trial ended in a mistrial with a jury unable to reach consensus on any of three rape counts against him. He was promptly retried, and a jury found him guilty of two counts while failing to reach a verdict on the third.",

      "\u201cCostume Art,\u201d announced Monday as the next big show at the museum\u2019s Costume Institute \u2014 launched by the starry Met Gala in 2026 \u2014 aims to make that connection more literal than ever, pairing garments with objects from across the museum to show how fashion has long been intertwined with different art forms.",
      "Max Hollein, CEO and director of the Met, said in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement that he hopes the exhibit will take visitors to the New York museum on a (very fashionable) journey through art history, where they will see connections throughout.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a show that can really live in fascinating ways at the museum and can pull from all different areas of our collection \u2014 paintings, sculpture, drawings,\u201d Hollein said.",
      "\u201cI hope we all agree that fashion is art,\u201d Hollein added. \u201cBut actually I think the exhibition \u2026 will make it obvious how fashion is actually happening, so to say, all across the museum and in all different mediums already.\u201d",
      "The new show will examine the dressed body, and will be organized thematically by different body types, according to the Costume Institute's curator in charge, Andrew Bolton. It will include the \u201cNaked Body\u201d and the \u201cClassical Body,\u201d for example, but also less expected themes like the \u201cPregnant Body\u201d and the \u201cAging Body.\u201d",
      "The connections that will be drawn between artworks and garments will range, curators said in a statement, \u201cfrom the formal to the conceptual, the aesthetic to the political, the individual to the universal, the illustrative to the symbolic, and the playful to the profound.\u201d",
      "One example: in the \u201cNaked Body\u201d section, a 1504 print from German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer will be paired with spandex bodysuits by Belgian designer Walter Van Beirendonck from a 2009 collection that revisits the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.",

      "\u201cMaking movies is not what I do, it's who I am,\u201d said Cruise. He was composed as always, but at moments seemed near tears as he spoke, grasping the gold honorary statuette that celebrated his more than 40 years at the apex of the industry at the film academy's annual Governors Awards.",
      "\u201cIn that theater we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together,\u201d he said after a two-minute ovation.",
      "Production designer Wynn Thomas and choreographer and actor Debbie Allen were also selected by the academy's board of governors to be honored for their storied careers, and an absent Dolly Parton was honored for a lifetime of philanthropy at the ceremony at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Los Angeles.",

      "\u201cI will always do everything I can to help this art form,\u201d Cruise said. \u201cTo support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful. Hopefully without too many more broken bones.\u201d",
      "Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu presented Cruise the award. The two have spent several months shooting a film in London set for release in 2026. The collaboration suggests that Cruise, who has stuck to blockbuster franchise fare in recent years, might not be done trying to win an Academy Award the old-fashioned way.",
      "\u201cThis may be his first Oscar,\u201d I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said, \u201cbut from what I have seen and experienced, this will not be the last.\u201d",

      "His record label said Saturday in a statement posted to his social media accounts that Snider died Friday.",
      "\u201cWhere do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases?\u201d the statement read. \u201cAlways creating rhyme and meter that immediately felt like an old friend or a favorite blanket. Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.\u201d",
      "Snider's family and friends had said in a Friday statement that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere. The diagnosis came on the heels of the cancellation of a tour after Snider had been the victim of a violent assault in the Salt Lake City area, according to a Nov. 3 statement from his management team.",
      "But Salt Lake City police later arrested Snider himself when he at first refused to leave a hospital and later returned and threatened staffers, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.",
      "The scrapped tour was in support of his most recent album, \u201cHigh, Lonesome and Then Some,\u201d which released in October.

      "He modeled himself on \u2014 and at times met and was mentored by \u2014 artists like Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark and John Prine. His songs were recorded by artists including Jerry Jeff Walker, Billy Joe Shaver and Tom Jones. And he co-wrote a song with Loretta Lynn that appeared on her 2016 album, \u201cFull Circle.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House Historical Association has reclaimed a series of sketches by American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell, spending a whopping $7.25 million at auction on Friday.",
      "The four 1940s-era sketches titled \u201cSo You Want to See the President!\u201d were displayed in the West Wing for years, but were removed in 2022 after a family dispute over who owned them.",
      "The sketches show a variety of people \u2014 journalists, military officers and even a Miss America Pageant winner and her publicist \u2014 seated on plush-looking red chairs as they waited to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were put up for sale by a grandson of the White House official who had received them as a gift from Rockwell.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how personally thrilled I am that the White House Historical Association preserved this piece of White House history,\u201d said Anita McBride, who sits on the association\u2019s board of directors.",
      "The White House Historical Association's winning bid was $5.8 million. It's total cost to reclaim the art, including the buyer's premium paid to the auction house, was $7.25 million.",
      "The price tag is by far the most ever paid by the association, which holds a vast collection of art, furniture and other items as part of its mission to help the White House collect and display artifacts that represent American history and culture.",
      "Before Friday, the most the association had paid for an artifact was $1.5 million for \u201cThe Builders,\u201d by African American artist Jacob Lawrence, in 2007, McBride said. That work depicts hard-working men in orange, red and brown tones, and hangs in the White House Green Room.",
      "The sketches sold Friday are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, according to Heritage Auctions, the Dallas-based auction house that sold them. The series was created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post.",

      "NEW YORK -- When Kristen Wiig steps out of a vintage Rolls-Royce in the opening scene of Season 2 of \u201cPalm Royale,\u201d she\u2019s sporting a tall, yellow, fringed hat, gold platform sandals and sunny bell bottoms, with fabric petals that sway with every determined step. It\u2019s the first clue that the costumes on the female-driven comedy are taking center stage.",
      "The Apple TV show made a splash in its first season with the starry cast, high production values and ubiquitous grasshopper cocktail. Wiig\u2019s character, Maxine, tries to break into Palm Beach high society in 1969 and bumps heads with co-stars Carol Burnett, Allison Janney, Leslie Bibb and Laura Dern. But also playing a starring role are the vintage designer frocks that reflect each character.",
      "For Season 2, which premiered this week, Emmy-winning costume designer Alix Friedberg says she and her team coordinated \u201cthousands\u201d of looks that reflect the characters\u2019 jet-setting style. She says 50-60% of the brightly colored and graphic print costumes are original vintage designer pieces, sourced by shoppers and costume designers.",
      "\u201cThe looks are so iconic. Sometimes Kristen will walk in in something, and it brings tears to my eyes,\u201d Kaia Gerber \u2014 who plays Mitzi \u2014 told The Associated Press in a recent interview.",
      "If not original vintage, Friedberg\u2019s team builds the costumes, and if a character has to wear an outfit in multiple scenes or in big dance numbers, the team may create duplicates to preserve continuity. Friedberg says she was lucky to find so many vendors with vintage designer pieces in great condition.",
      "\u201c(Bibb\u2019s character) Dinah wears a few original Oscar de la Renta pieces that are really so perfect. Bill Blass was a big one, Oleg Cassini,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThere\u2019s a dress that (Janney\u2019s character) Evelyn wears that's this all emerald green jersey, it\u2019s an original Halston and it\u2019s so stunning on her and it really does sort of evoke what\u2019s to come in the '70s.\u201d",
      "Janney calls Friedberg \u201cbrilliant\u201d and marveled at her talent at finding pieces that are like works of art. Some of her favorites were the characters\u2019 apr\u00e8s-ski looks in the Swiss Alps \u2014 but she finds it hard to pick an ultimate favorite.",
      "\u201cAll of them just make me feel divine. And the hair is just a masterpiece, and the makeup \u2014 it all goes together to just create Evelyn and I barely have to do anything,\u201d Janney says.",
      "The costumes also help heighten the comedy. Friedberg says Evelyn\u2019s stoic and deadpan character elicits laughs with some of her over-the-top getups.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s delivering this dialogue, these lines with, like, seven wigs on top of her,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThe absurdity comes out really in how these women present themselves time and time again. \u2026 It was just so much fun to get to laugh and wink at the audience.\u201d",
      "Burnett called costume fittings on the show \u201cgreat fun\u201d and said they helped her find her character, the scheming Norma. \u201cI work from the outside in. I have to know what I\u2019m going to look like,\u201d she says.",

      "The costumes also help set the tone for the female empowerment theme that permeates this season. \u201cEvelyn wore a lot more pants \u2014 which seems ridiculous to say today \u2014 but back then that was a real power move,\u201d Friedberg says.",

      "The BBC has apologized to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it strongly disagreed that there was a basis for a defamation lawsuit",
      "LONDON -- The BBC has issued a public apology to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it \u201cstrongly disagreed there is a basis for a defamation claim.\u201d",
      "Since it was established more than a century ago, Britain's public broadcaster has been no stranger to controversy. Over the past week, it has been embroiled in one of its deepest-ever crisis as its director general stepped down, its head of news quit, questions were raised over the veracity of its journalism and Trump said he is mulling a billion-dollar lawsuit.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Pressure on the broadcaster has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier compiled by the BBC's adviser on standards and guidelines on Nov. 3.",
      "As well as criticizing the BBC\u2019s coverage of transgender issues and raising concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service, the dossier said that an edition of the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs series \u201cPanorama\" \u2014 titled \u201cTrump: A Second Chance?\u201d \u2014 broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election was misleading.",
      "Specifically, it showed how the third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the Jan. 6, 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "By doing so, it made it look like Trump was giving the green light to his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.",
      "The outcry from opponents of the BBC \u2014 and there are many both in the U.K. and abroad \u2014 was immediate and vociferous.",
      "The broadcaster, which is funded by an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all U.K. households who watch live TV or any BBC content, was accused of bias against Trump, symptomatic of they say an inherent liberal bias within the organization.",
      "For days, the BBC said very little, saying it did not report to leaked reports. Many thought that was a misjudgement as it allowed the narrative around the edit to be led by its opponents.",
      "By Nov. 9, the pressure on the BBC was becoming increasingly acute, prompting its top executive, Tim Davie, and head of news Deborah Turness to resign over what the broadcaster called an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d",
      "It was also revealed that Trump was demanding a retraction, apology and compensation over the sequence. \u201cI guess I have to,\u201d Trump said when asked about whether he would go through with his legal threat. \u201cBecause I think they defrauded the public and they\u2019ve admitted it.\u201d",

      "In a statement, it said its chair, Samir Shah, had personally sent a letter via a letter from its chair over the misleading edit but said it had not defamed him.",
      "While the BBC statement doesn\u2019t respond to Trump\u2019s demand that he be compensated for \u201coverwhelming financial and reputational harm,\u201d the headline on its news story about the apology said it refused to pay compensation.",
      "The U.S. president has yet to respond to the BBC's apology and its rejection of of his demands for compensation.",
      "Legal experts have said that Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the U.K. or the U.S. They said that the BBC could show that Trump wasn\u2019t harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.",
      "While many legal experts have dismissed the president\u2019s claims against the media as having little merit, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies and he could try to leverage the BBC mistake for a payout, potentially to a charity of his choice.",
      "However this latest crisis pans out in the days and weeks ahead, the heat will remain on the BBC, especially in its newsrooms where any mistake, or seeming bias, will no doubt be picked up opponents.",
      "As a public broadcaster, the BBC has to be impartial in the way it covers news events. It's a fine balancing act that often gets the BBC into trouble. Some think it leans too much to the right, while others think it goes the other way. Whatever the truth of the matter, many think that the BBC is often cowed in its coverage, particularly on domestic political matters.",

      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",

If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",

      "After a disruptive U.S. government shutdown, federal SNAP food assistance is again flowing to low-income households. But in the months ahead, many participants will have to abide by new work requirements.",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides monthly benefits \u2014 averaging around $190 per person \u2014 to about 42 million people nationwide. During the first couple weeks of November, many of those recipients missed their regular allotments as President Donald Trump's administration battled in court over whether tap into reserves to fund the program while the government was shut down.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about SNAP:",
      "For the first part of the month, the situation was chaotic after the federal government said SNAP would not be funded because of the government shutdown.",
      "Some states replenished the electronic benefit cards used in the program either fully or partially, using their own funds or federal dollars that were part of court orders. Others didn't.",
      "Most states boosted food charities, but lines were long and some shelves were empty.",
      "As soon as the government reopened on Nov. 12, many states rushed to get out benefits.",

      "A massive tax and spending bill signed into law in July by Trump expanded requirements for many adult SNAP recipients to work, volunteer or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don\u2019t are limited to three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The work requirements previously applied to adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents. The new law also applies those requirements to those ages 55 through 64 and to parents without children younger than 14. It repeals work exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans and young adults aging out of foster care. And it limits the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas lacking jobs.",

Because of that pressure to do more \u2014 including from Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2014 the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he'll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqu\u00e9, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.",
      "\u201cI think things have changed, which is a very good thing,\u201d said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there\u2019s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that what\u2019s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you\u2019re looking at an ambition gap,\u2033 said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of expectation, there\u2019s a lot of excitement here, but there\u2019s also a lot of political signals that\u2019s been sent by President Lula.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It\u2019s almost like a staring contest,\u201d Inventor said. \u201cBut next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.\u201d",
      "Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.",
      "Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.",
      "In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn\u2019t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth's warming.",
      "Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.",
      "So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what\u2019s planned in national pledges and what\u2019s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.",
      "That's not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year\u2019s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.",
      "So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.",
      "On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.",
      "\u201cThe parties will decide how they want to proceed,\u201d do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.",
      "In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: \u201cEh, could be better but not as bad it could be.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- When Jennifer Austin met Molly in second grade, they quickly became best friends. They giggled through classes until the teacher separated them, inspiring them to come up with their own language. They shared sleepovers and went on each other's family vacations.",
      "But they gradually drifted apart after Austin's family moved to Germany before the girls started high school. Decades passed before they recently reconnected as grown women.",
      "\u201cStrong friendships really do stay for the long haul,\" Austin, 51, said. \"Even if there are pauses in between and they fade, that doesn\u2019t mean they completely dissolve or they go forgotten. They\u2019re always there kind of lingering like a little light in the back.\u201d",
      "Early friendships are some of the deepest: the schoolmates who shared bike rides and their favorite candy. The roommates who offered comfort after breakups. The ones who know us, sometimes better than we know ourselves.",
      "But as adults take on jobs and the responsibilities of homes and families, it can be challenging to stay connected with everyone we've loved.",
      "Technology plays a role, too. Loneliness has increased since the television was invented and intensified with the introduction of smartphones, according to psychologist Marisa Franco, a University of Maryland assistant clinical professor and author of \u201cPlatonic,\u201d a book about the science of attachment.",
      "Once they've lost touch with friends, some people are reluctant to reach out, fearing rejection. But most of those on the receiving end appreciate the effort more than we expect, Franco said.",
      "\u201cPeople are delighted to hear from their old friends and open to connections,\u201d she said.",
      "Franco suggests reminiscing about a shared memory to span the time and distance. It can be something as simple as, \"This pic came up and I just realized I wanted to check in on you,\u201d she said. Propose a meetup. If the friend lives far away, try scheduling a phone date to catch up.",
      "Below, six people who tried to rekindle lost friendships reflect on distance, loss and reconnection.",
      "Heather Robb and Laine DiPasquantonio were nearly inseparable in their 20s, when they both lived in Boston. They went to concerts and vacationed together. DiPasquantonio was there when Robb met her future husband and attended their wedding as a bridesmaid.",
      "But sometime after Robb married and DiPasquantonio moved to Colorado, their circle of friends scattered. They became busy raising children, juggling jobs and caring for aging parents.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible because you don\u2019t know it\u2019s happening,\u201d Robb, 60, said in a joint interview. \u201cI think it was simply space and time. We were all in different cities, we were all in that busy time of toddlers.\u201d",
      "Years passed with occasional holiday cards and texts but few meaningful interactions. DiPasquantonio saw photos on social media of Robb skiing and traveling with other friends. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure there was so much room for me, from a distance,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAww, I feel badly about that,\u201d Robb replied. \u201cI would argue that's the bad side of social media.\u201d",
      "The women found their way back to each other when Robb, president of Heather Robb Communications, had a business trip to Denver in April. She called to see if DiPasquantonio wanted to get dinner. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if she was going to be that happy to hear from me. I actually had some trepidation in reaching out,\" Robb said.",
      "When she did, Robb learned her friend was about to undergo surgery for breast cancer. Instead of meeting for dinner, DiPasquantonio, a placement specialist at Harmony Senior Referrals, invited Robb to stay for the weekend. A mutual friend flew out to join them.",
      "\u201cI was so tickled that you called and wanted to get together. It was awesome,\u201d DiPasquantonio, 63, said during their interview. \u201cWhat took us so long, right?\u201d",

      "A 47-year-old New Jersey man died last year from alpha-gal syndrome, which in 2011 was first linked to bites from the Lone Star tick.",
      "More than 100,000 people in the U.S. have become allergic to red meat since 2010 because of the syndrome, according to one estimate.",
      "Some outside experts said it appears to be the first documented case of someone suffering a deadly alpha-gal reaction shortly after eating meat.",
      "It's possible other deaths have happened but were assumed to be from other causes and not thoroughly investigated like this one was, said Joshua Benoit, a tick biologist at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson said the agency was not involved in this investigation and could not speak definitively about whether it's the first such death. The CDC recently released a free online training module to increase awareness and improve diagnosing, she added.",
      "Dr. Scott Commins, a leading alpha-gal syndrome researcher at the University of North Carolina, called the death an \u201cunmitigated tragedy.\u201d",
      "\"Totally unnecessary and with increased awareness, this won\u2019t happen again,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "The case report was published this week in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. The lead author was the University of Virginia\u2019s Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, who led the 2011 paper that first linked Lone Star tick bites to the meat allergy.",
      "People with alpha-gal syndrome can experience symptoms including hives, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, severe stomach pain, difficulty breathing, dizziness and swelling of the lips, throat, tongue or eye lids. Unlike some other food allergies, which occur soon after eating, these reactions typically hit hours later.",

      "The researchers said blood tests revealed evidence of alpha-gal syndrome. Proof that it came from a Lone Star tick is incomplete. The authors made the link based on a statement from the man's wife, who had said he had 12 or 13 \u201cchigger\u201d bites around his ankles earlier in the summer.",
      "But the conclusion makes sense, as people in the eastern U.S. sometimes mistake the bites from mites with those from larval ticks, Commins said.",
      "The number of cases of Alpha-gal syndrome is growing for a variety of reasons, including the Lone Star tick's expanding range, more people coming into contact with the ticks and more doctors learning about it and ordering tests for it.",

    "story": [
      "The company that makes OxyContin, members of the Sackler family who own it and many groups that sued over its role in the opioid crisis are asking a judge to approve a settlement plan",
      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.",
      "If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter \u2014 and maybe the entire book \u2014 on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.",
      "Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.",
      "The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.",
      "This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.",
      "A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable \u2014 something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.",
      "A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough.",
      "\u201cThe natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,\u201d Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.",
      "A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.",
      "Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis.",

      "The Purdue deal would rank among the largest of them. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing.",
      "The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis.",
      "There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.",
      "Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities.",
      "And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.",
      "Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue\u2019s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.",
      "About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue\u2019s opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000. Legal fees would reduce what people actually receive.",
      "One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder.",
      "\u201cTell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can\u2019t do anything with it,\u201d asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.",
      "Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars.",

      "China is rapidly replacing its aging diesel trucks with electric models, signaling a major shift in the world\u2019s largest vehicle market",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.",
      "In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.",
      "Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbon-dioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.",
      "Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.",
      "Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.",
      "China\u2019s trucking fleet, the world\u2019s second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and \"in other countries, it might never take off,\u201d he said.",
      "The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.",
      "While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle\u2019s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,\u201d Doleman said.",
      "Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.",
      "Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.",
      "Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.",

      "A massive illegal trash dump near Oxford has sparked outrage in England",
      "LONDON -- A mountain of illegally dumped trash near a river in the country outside Oxford was visible from space but few on Earth seemed to notice the mess.",
      "Hidden behind a thick row of trees from the busy highway next to it, the pile grew to the length of three Olympic-sized swimming pools and reached up to the roof of a two-story house as motorists unknowingly sped past.",
      "How the garbage got there and how long the massive pile had been growing remains a mystery, but its recent discovery has caused an outcry about a brewing environmental crisis and drawn attention to England's uphill battle to tackle criminal gangs suspected of illegally dumping waste.",
      "\u201cHow they managed to escape the eyes is quite shocking,\u201d said Liz Gyekye of Thames 21, an environmental charity. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that these perpetrators are caught swiftly and punished for their crimes. This is an environmental catastrophe unfolding at the doorstep of one of our nation\u2019s most treasured rivers.\"",
      "With winter rains coming and the trash sitting in a floodplain, there are concerns it will be swept into the adjacent River Cherwell, which meanders downstream through the Oxford University campus before meeting the River Thames that eventually flows to London and then out to sea.",
      "Although it was only reported in the news last week, the Environment Agency in England said it identified the area as a high-risk illegal waste site after becoming aware of it in July and issued a cease-and-desist order. The agency obtained a court order last month to shut down the area after learning about the continued dumping, which is now being investigated as a crime.",
      "When the dumping began is unclear, but satellite footage obtained by Thames21 showed verdant fields in April 2024 and what appeared to be a whiteish streak of the garbage between two rows of trees in July this year.",
      "Weeks before the public became aware of the dump alongside the A34 highway near the village of Kidlington, the government came under fire from a Parliamentary committee for being slow to act on a problem the agency said costs England's economy 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) annually.",
      "Enough garbage is illegally dumped each year to fill the 90,000-seat Wembley Stadium 35 times, the Environment and Climate Change Committee in the House of Lords said in a recent report. The committee urged the government to get tough on the organized crime groups suspected to be behind the problem.",
      "\u201cDespite the scale and seriousness of the crimes, raised by the members of the public in many cases, we have found multiple failings by the Environment Agency and other agencies, from slow responses to repeated public reports (as in the case of Hoads Wood, Kent) through to a woeful lack of successful convictions,\u201d said Shaista Ahmad Sheehan, the committee chair.",
      "The scourge of everything from bags of household waste to appliances and furniture being dumped in cities and countryside is a growing problem.",
      "\u201cFly-tipping,\u201d as it's known in the U.K., is a combination of the word for dumping while doing it on the fly, often from a moving vehicle. The practice is a source of angst for landowners and local government and an eyesore for a nation proud of its natural beauty.",

      "China is rapidly replacing its aging diesel trucks with electric models, signaling a major shift in the world\u2019s largest vehicle market",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.",
      "In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.",
      "Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbon-dioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.",
      "Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.",
      "Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.",
      "China\u2019s trucking fleet, the world\u2019s second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and \"in other countries, it might never take off,\u201d he said.",
      "The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.",
      "While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle\u2019s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,\u201d Doleman said.",
      "Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.",
      "Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.",
      "Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.",
      "CATL, the world\u2019s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering 150,000 kilometers (about 93,000 miles) out of China's 184,000 kms (about 114,000 miles) of expressways.",
      "The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say.",
      "Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "\u201cThe rise of China\u2019s electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,\u201d said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy.",

      "But Doleman views LNG as a \u201ctransitional step\u201d unlikely to be seen apart from in China, where a vast pipeline infrastructure, abundant domestic gas production and byproducts like coke oven gas created conditions conducive to LNG-fueled trucking not seen elsewhere.",
      "China is planning new emission standards for vehicles that will limit multiple pollutants and set average greenhouse gas targets across a manufacturer\u2019s fleet. This will make it \u201calmost impossible\u201d for companies relying solely on fossil-fuel vehicles to comply, Yang said.",
      "A 2020 ICCT study found LNG-fueled trucks cut emissions by 2%-9% over 100 years but can be more polluting in the short run due to leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.",

      "The changes include the elimination of the Fish and Wildlife Service's \u201cblanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants newly classified as threatened. Government agencies instead would have to craft species-specific rules for protections, a potentially lengthy process.",
      "Environmentalists warned the changes could cause yearslong delays in efforts to save species such as the monarch butterfly, Florida manatee, California spotted owl and North American wolverine.",

      "NEW YORK -- Target\u2019s third-quarter profit tumbled as the retailer struggles to lure shoppers that are being pressed by stubbornly high inflation.",
      "The Minneapolis company said Wednesday that it expects its sales slump to extend through the critical holiday shopping season. The company also announced that it's planning to invest another billion dollars next year to remodel stores and build new ones, increasing the total cost for the makeover to $5 billion.",
      "Investors have punished Target\u2019s stock recently, sending it down 43% over the past year. Shares edged lower before the opening bell.",
      "Turning around the 19% profit slide in the most recent quarter is the latest challenge to incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke, a 20-year company veteran who is replacing CEO Brian Cornell on Feb. 1. The handover arrives as the retailer tries to reverse a persistent sales malaise and to revive its reputation as the place to go for affordable but stylish products.",
      "Target\u2019s troubles stand in stark contrast to rival Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, which is thriving. Walmart reports on it's most recent quarterly performance Thursday.",
      "Target announced in October that it was eliminating about 1,800 corporate positions in an effort to streamline decision-making and accelerate initiatives to rebuild the flagging customer base. The cuts represent about 8% of Target\u2019s corporate workforce.",
      "To pump up sales, Target is offering more than 20,000 new items, twice as many as last year, and it has lowered prices on thousands of food, beverage and essential items.",
      "\u201cWe have high but achievable aspirations for Target\u2019s future, and we\u2019re acting urgently to make the changes and investments,\u201d Fiddelke told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "With about 1,980 U.S. stores, Target has struggled to find its footing since inflation caused pinched shoppers to curtail their discretionary spending. Customers have complained of messy stores with merchandise that did not reflect the expensive-looking but budget-priced niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname \u201cTarzhay.\u201d",
      "Consumer boycotts since late January, when Target joined rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back its corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, have compounded the predicament.",
      "Retailers have spent almost 11 months navigating President Donald Trump\u2019s wide-ranging tariffs on imports and his immigration crackdown that threatened to shrink the supply of workers.",
      "The just ended 43-day federal shutdown is expected to be another drag on an economy, though its full impact will take months to measure. Government contract awards have slowed and many food aid recipients have seen their benefits interrupted.",
      "Fiddelke told reporters that the company saw a weaker September but he said it was \u201ctricky for us to isolate\u201d the different factors behind that.",

But the company said recent efforts to revamp sporting goods, toys and tech gadgets have spurred stronger sales.",

      "New York City's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, has quickly become a target of conservative media figures",
      "New York City's incoming mayor, Zohran Mamdani, hasn't taken office yet. But he's already the new avatar of evil for conservative media figures.",
      "He's been called \u201cdownright sinister\u201d and \u201cincompatible with America.\u201d His labels include commie, Marxist, jihadist sympathizer and \u201cseething leftist.\u201d Fox News' Laura Ingraham warned her viewers not to be fooled by \u201csmiling socialists who rule like Soviet tyrants.\u201d",
      "A New York Post post-election cover that depicted Mamdani holding aloft the Soviet Union's hammer and sickle symbol sold out on newsstands by noon and was offered on e-Bay for $75. By the end of the day, the Post was selling baby onesies and commemorative plates emblazoned with the cover.",
      "Already, conservative outlets see Mamdani joining Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton as someone guaranteed to make their audiences' blood boil. And by doing so, they can help Republicans in the midterm elections.",
      "\u201cIt's very clear that he's going to be the No. 1 target of right-wing media for the foreseeable future, well into 2026,\u201d said Howard Polskin, publisher of the Righting, a newsletter that follows conservative media. \u201cHe's colorful, controversial and not afraid of a fight.\u201d",
      "The head of an outlet that Polskin regularly monitors, the Daily Signal, said Mamdani is likely seen as a threat because his appeal to working-class Americans who feel left behind by the economy is similar to that of President Donald Trump, although they have different ideas about how to handle that.",
      "\u201cRemember years ago there was Nancy Pelosi who was the bogeyman for Republicans,\u201d said Rob Bluey, president and executive editor of the Daily Signal. \u201cI think Mamdani is probably going to be the new person. I think that\u2019s why you see a lot of emphasis on him in conservative media.\u201d",
      "In the Washington Examiner, editor-in-chief Hugo Gurdon saw ominous signs in Mamdani's election night victory speech. \u201cHe was downright sinister, glorying not just in his achievement but in having laid low his vanquished enemies and stuck it to others besides. He took off his smiling campaign mask and revealed his venomous self,\u201d Gurdon wrote.",
      "Newsmax's Rob Schmitt called Mamdani the \u201cmayor for the foreign-born. We have flooded the country with diversity, and diversity delivered us Zohran.\" In an interview, Schmitt said he wasn't quite ready to anoint Mamdani as a deliberate target for the conservative media.",
      "\u201cA go-to bogeyman makes it sound like it's manufactured,\u201d he told The Associated Press, \u201cwhereas we are just appropriately concerned about people that are spewing or trying to push an ideology that is destined to not work.\u201d",
      "The Post recognized Mamdani as a target of interest well before the election. Between Oct. 27 and Nov. 5, he was the subject of seven of the tabloid's covers. One, headlined \u201cMam-Child,\" depicted Mamdani in a little boy's overalls to illustrate a column warning that the city wasn't a toy to hand to a \u201cbaby like Zohran.\u201d Another front page blared \u201cNot Zo Fast\u201d to herald a tightening race in the polls. Election Day's lead headline was \u201cTrump to New York: Keep the Commie Out.\u201d",
      "Mamdani reached out to the White House post-election for a meeting with Trump and the president said Sunday that \u201cwe'll work something out.\u201d",
      "Mamdani\u2019s status as a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and his Muslim background are behind many of the conservative media attacks.",
      "Asked on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this spring whether he was a communist, Mamdani said, \u201cNo, I am not.\u201d Webster's defines socialism as a political theory where the community or government owns and controls the production and distribution of goods. Communism, advanced by revolutionary Karl Marx, is considered a step beyond, where private property and capitalism no longer exist.",

He's far worse than a socialist.\u201d",

Podcaster Michael Savage called him a \u201cMarxist jihadist sympathizer.\u201d Influencer Laura Loomer predicted Mamdani would encourage Muslims to commit political assassinations to acquire power and silence critics.",
      "Mamdani's staff did not return messages from The Associated Press. In the waning days of his campaign, he spoke out against some of the religious-based attacks on him.",
      "\u201cI thought that if I behaved well enough or bit my tongue enough in the face or racist, baseless attacks all while returning back to my central message, it would allow me to be more than just my faith,\u201d he said. \u201cI was wrong. No amount of redirection is ever enough.\u201d",
      "Some of the attacks reflect a common theme in politics and the media \u2014 not unique to Mamdani \u2014 to associate all members of a political party with the beliefs of one who could be depicted as on the fringe. The Daily Signal wrote after his election that Mamdani \u201cis now the putative leader of his party.\u201d",
      "The Victory Girls conservative blog used an illustration of the incoming mayor in a military uniform. \"The socialists are coming, and Mamdani is just the beginning,\u201d the blog wrote. \u201cIf we ignore them, we will all be in big trouble.\u201d",

      "Carusone said he's not sure if Mamdani will become a villain of the conservative media on the level of a Clinton or Pelosi, but he can understand the urgency.",
      "\u201cIf you don't check him now,\" Carusone said, \u201che's going to capture the young people.\"",

      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\u201cWe will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information \u201cso we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.\u201d",

      "Account holders 16-years-old and older who were mistakenly given notice that they would be excluded can contact Yoti Age Verification and verify their age by providing government-issued identity documents or a \u201cvideo selfie,\u201d Meta said.",

      "The government has warned platforms that demanding that all account holders prove they are older than 15 would be an unreasonable response to the new age restrictions. The government maintains the platforms already had sufficient data about many account holders to ascertain they were not young children.",

      "Greystar, the nation\u2019s largest landlord, has reached a $7 million settlement with nine states that sued the property management giant for using rent-setting algorithms that officials have blamed for driving up housing costs.",
      "The proposed settlement, filed Tuesday in a North Carolina federal court, is the latest to result from antitrust lawsuits targeting RealPage and similar software companies. Prosecutors argue the products help rival property managers illegally align prices and push up rents. A judge must still approve the deal.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s through smoke-filled backroom deals or through an algorithm on your computer screen, colluding to drive up prices is illegal,\u201d Democratic California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a news release. \u201cFamilies across the country are staring down an affordability crisis. Companies that intentionally fuel this unaffordability by raising prices to line their own pockets can be sure I will use the full force of my office to hold them accountable.\u201d",
      "As part of the settlement, Greystar will no longer use software that relies on other landlords\u2019 confidential data to set rents. Greystar also agreed separately last month to pay $50 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over its use of RealPage. And in August, the company reached a separate nonmonetary deal with the Department of Justice to halt similar practices.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased this matter is resolved and remain focused on serving our residents and clients,\u201d Greystar said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Based in South Carolina, Greystar manages more than 946,000 units nationwide, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council. RealPage, which is based in Texas, has said its software is used on fewer than 10% of rental units in the U.S., and that its price recommendations are used less than half the time.

      "The flight disruptions during the record government shutdown have inspired a rare act of bipartisanship",
      "The flight disruptions during the record government shutdown that ended last week inspired a rare act of bipartisanship in Washington on Tuesday, when congressional representatives from both parties introduced legislation that would allow air traffic controllers to get paid during future shutdowns.",
      "The bill proposes funding salaries, operating expenses and other Federal Aviation Administration programs by tapping into a little-used fund with $2.6 billion that was created to reimburse airlines if the government commandeers their planes and they are damaged. The bill's sponsors, which include four of the top Republicans and Democrats on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, hope that relying on the fund might make their bill more attractive than other proposals because it would limit the potential cost of dolling out paychecks.",
      "U.S. Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri, the GOP chairman of the committee, said in a statement that the bill would help keep the traveling public safe during future shutdowns. The other sponsors include Democratic U.S. Reps. Rick Larsen of Washington and Andre Carson of Indiana, along with Republican U.S. Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas, who leads the aviation subcommittee.",
      "\u201cWe all saw that the system can be vulnerable when Congress can\u2019t get its job done,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThis bill guarantees that controllers, who have one of the most high-pressure jobs in the nation, will get paid during any future funding lapses and that air traffic control, aviation safety, and the traveling public will never again be negatively impacted by shutdowns.\u201d",
      "The bill\u2019s introduction comes ahead of a scheduled hearing Wednesday by a Senate subcommittee to examine the impacts of the 43-day shutdown on aviation.",
      "But it's not clear whether this bill \u2014 or any similar proposals that have been floating around Congress since the 2019 shutdown \u2014 will have a chance to get approved before the next government funding deadline at the end of January. Nearly all the other proposals, including one from U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, would rely on the aviation trust fund that collects money from fees the airlines pay, and the Congressional Budget Office has given those bills a much higher price tag.",
      "Over the years, lawmakers have tried a handful of fixes for a long-term solution to keep air traffic controllers and other essential aviation workers paid during funding lapses. The proposals often gained bipartisan attention, especially after the 35-day shutdown that ended in 2019 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, but none made it over the finish line.",
      "Moran's bill, known as the Aviation Funding Stability Act, for example, is a recurring proposal in Congress that would allow the FAA to tap into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Lawmakers in both chambers have reintroduced versions of it over the years, including in 2019 and 2021.",
      "The legislation resurfaced in March when Moran, the Republican chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Aviation, Space, and Innovation, put it forward. It came up again in September, weeks before the shutdown began, when Carson and U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, also a Democrat, introduced it in the House.",
      "The new bill introduced Tuesday would cut off the money if the insurance fund dips below $1 billion. But Transportation Committee staffers estimate that would still provide enough funding to keep FAA operating for four to six weeks.",
      "The issue gets so much attention because of all the flight delays and cancellations that happen during a shutdown as more air traffic controllers call out of work. The existing shortage of controllers is so severe that just a few absences in an airport tower or other FAA radar facilities can cause problems.",

      "The controllers \u2014 and the FAA technicians who maintain the equipment they rely on \u2014 are expected to continue working without pay during a shutdown to keep flights operating. But as the shutdown dragged on this fall, more controllers began calling out of work, citing the financial pressures and the need to take on side jobs.",
      "The delays got so bad during the latest shutdown that the government ordered airlines to cut some of their flights at 40 busy airports nationwide, in what the FAA said was an unprecedented but necessary move to relieve pressure on the system and controllers. Thousands of flights were canceled before the FAA lifted the order entirely and airlines were able to resume normal operations Monday.",
      "The fund that the bill introduced Tuesday would use was created years ago to pay for claims an airline might file if the government uses one of its planes for a military operation or other use. But that's not common anymore.",
      "The last time a claim was made was after America\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The fund has continued to grow as it collects interest.",
      "For a time it was also used for an insurance fund at a time when airlines were having trouble getting any insurance coverage after 9/11. For years, airlines paid into the fund regularly to get coverage from the government.",
      "But by the early 2010s the insurance market for airlines had stabilized. Congress let the insurance program expire at the end of 2014.",

      "Still, Johannesburg has been a hive of activity ahead of the summit \u2014 workers have undertaken a massive clean-up of the streets and bright flowers have been planted along some city roads, adorned with colorful G20 banners and billboards.",
      "While the hosts have admitted that the U.S. absence raises concerns about the summit's ultimate success, South Africa's foreign minister, Ronald Lamola, said Tuesday it was also an opportunity \u201cto send a clear message that the world can move on\" without the U.S. \u2014 but that it won't be easy.",
      "\u201cIt will not be a walk in the park, but when there is global consensus, we can be able to find persuasive means to enable the world to function,\u201d Lamola said.",

      "Lamola also cited China's Xi Jinping who has not been travelling much this year, instead sending Premier Li Qiang to represent him \u2014 including in South Africa.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin will also be absent from the summit as there is an arrest warrant against him by the International Criminal Court over Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "The warrant obliges South Africa, a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the court, to arrest Putin if he steps on its territory. Putin also missed the summit of the BRICS group of emerging economies in South Africa in 2023 for the same reason.",
      "South Africa has used its presidency of the G20 to push for action to address the challenges of poor nations \u2014 such as securing financing to help countries facing the devastating effects of climate change, something independent experts estimate would require about $1 trillion a year by 2030.",

      "The return of Brazil\u2019s president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva to UN climate talks was hoped to spur nations to meet a self-imposed early deadline for progress on tough issues",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- The arrival of Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva at U.N. climate talks on Wednesday was hoped to spur nations to meet a self-imposed early deadline for progress on tough issues. For now, it hasn't worked.",
      "In a news conference late Wednesday, Lula skipped over any update on the status of talks. Instead, he renewed his earlier calls for action, making the case to delegates that the world must reduce its use of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal.",
      "\"We haven\u2019t found another place to live,\u201d Lula, flanked by Brazilian negotiators and his wife, said.",
      "Lula and several other leaders are pushing to create a road map toward transition to renewable energies. But in his remarks Wednesday, he was careful to say there's no intention to \u201cimpose anything on anybody,\u201d that countries could transition at their own pace and count on financial help to do so.",
      "Lula's return to the talks, along with the presence of U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, had stirred some optimism that COP30, as the talks are known, would move forward more quickly ahead of Friday's scheduled wrap up. Host Brazil had pushed for progress on some key issues Wednesday, but it's routine for negotiators at these talks to miss deadlines.",
      "COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago had given negotiators a Wednesday deadline for a decision on four interconnected issues that were initially excluded from the official agenda: whether countries should be told to toughen their new climate plans; details on handing out $300 billion in pledged climate aid; dealing with trade barriers over climate and improving reporting on transparency and climate progress.",
      "Scores of countries, rich and poor, are also pushing for a detailed road map on how to phase out fossil fuels. And that's key to toughening new climate plans for a shot at limiting future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the global goal set in 2015's Paris Agreement.",
      "In 2023, after days of contentious debate, climate talks agreed to language calling for a transition away from fossil fuels \u2014 coal, oil and natural gas. But little has been done since to clarify or amplify on that one sentence. Protesters inside and outside the conference venue kept pushing for a phaseout.",
      "A group of scientists Wednesday criticized current proposals for a fossil fuel phaseout road map as inadequate, particularly to reach the goal of zero fossil fuel emissions by 2045 at the latest.",
      "\u201cA road map is not a workshop or a ministerial meeting. A road map is a real workplan that needs to show us the way from where we are to where we need to be, and how to get there,\u201d said a letter from seven prominent scientists, including some who are advising the COP30 presidency.",
      "Lula, in talking to leaders earlier in Belem, boosted the efforts of clarifying how to wean the world from the fuels that emit heat-trapping gases, the chief cause of climate change.",
      "The Brazilian president has also been pushing for more participation in a new multibillion international fund financed by interest-bearing debt instead of donations, called the Tropical Forests Forever Facility. It seeks to make it more lucrative for governments to keep their trees rather than cut them down.",
      "Iskander Erzini Vernoit, director of the IMAL Initiative for Climate and Development, an independent think-tank based in Morocco, said it won't be easy for Guterres and Lula to find common ground among negotiators.",
      "\u201cVarious apparent impasses still remain, and chief among these from an African point of view is the unwillingness of the EU and other rich countries to engage on their obligation to provide climate finance,\" Erzini Vernoit said.",

These are made with carbon fiber, a material better suited to eluding Russian radars than aluminum, Maksym, the head of design told the AP. He spoke on condition that only his first name be used for security reasons.",
      "Fire Point is a significant beneficiary of the so-called Danish model, a financing mechanism spearheaded by Denmark, in which foreign governments directly fund Ukrainian defense companies, rather than procuring weapons from their own industries to send as aid.

      "Anti-corruption agencies have said they were not investigating the Flamingo missile.",
      "Lawmakers raised an issue with Fire Point because of its apparent monopoly over deep strike drones, its ability to garner lucrative contracts despite being relatively unknown, and obscurity over its ownership. Its legally listed owner is Yehor Skalyha, who maintains connections to the entertainment industry, just like Mindich.",
      "Anti-corruption watchdogs have not released the findings of their investigation. Company founder Denys Shtilerman told AP that he is the majority owner, with Skalyha owning 2%.",

The same organization managed to fund the delivery of a Black Hawk helicopter to Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence, Polak said. \u201cWe feel that they are fighting for us,\u201d he said of his organization\u2019s reasons for funding the procurement of missiles to strike Russian targets.",
      "The current design of the Flamingo missile is a compilation of old Soviet weapons and new techniques. Engines were sourced from old Soviet jets, for example.",
      "Testing and fine-tuning is a constant process, Maksym said. \u201cAs of now we are still doing training launching, because our rockets were manufactured just six months ago. Right now, we are training, but we are training on objects in the territory of Russia and Crimea,\u201d he said.",
      "Workers conducted a mock run of a launch with a missile, this one painted black, that will be used in a future mission, he said. Workers drove in a truck that concealed the weapon.",
      "\u201cWe are studying, doing all we can to hit targets as far as we can,\u201d he said, adding that finding ways around Russian radar systems and electronic warfare remained an ongoing challenge. \u201cWe are learning from each launch to work on mistakes.\u201d",

      "Analysts said a 9.4% quarter-on-quarter drop in private residential investment, which translates to a 32.5% drop in annualized terms, was mainly due to revisions of Japan's building code that caused housing starts to plunge after they took effect in April, the start of Japan's fiscal year.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The biennial Dubai Air Show opened on Monday with hometown airline Emirates ordering 65 of Boeing's upcoming 777-9 aircraft, as the carrier looks to increase its fleets off record earnings and unending demand for flights through this East-West travel hub.",
      "Emirates valued the deal with Boeing and GE Engines at $38 billion at list prices, although airlines often negotiate lower prices in major orders.",
      "The announcement brings the total of Boeing 777-9s on order for Emirates to 270, making it Boeing's largest customer for the aircraft, even as the plane has suffered repeated delays in entering service. Emirates relies heavily on the double-decker Airbus A380 and the Boeing 777, and has also started flying the Airbus A350.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a long-term commitment that supports hundreds of thousands of high-value factory jobs, and it reinforces our 40-year partnership with Boeing and GE,\u201d said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the chairman and chief executive of Emirates.",
      "\u201cEmirates is already the world\u2019s largest operator of the 777 \u2014 all powered by the GE engines \u2014 and after today's order, I expect to remain the biggest 777 operator for the years to come.\u201d",
      "Sheikh Ahmed added that Emirates continued to encourage manufacturers to build larger aircraft with more capacity as air travel is only expected to grow. However, he smiled and looked at Boeing when putting forward his hoped-for timeline for putting the 777-9 in service for Emirates.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to receiving delivery of our first 777-9s starting from the second quarter of 2027,\u201d he said.",

Military sales as well remain a focus, with Russia again taking part despite facing Western sanctions over its grinding, yearslong war on Ukraine. Meanwhile, Israeli firms won't be attending over lingering anger from the devastating Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Emirates, the state-owned flagship airline of Dubai, earned annual profits of $5.2 billion in the last fiscal year and passenger numbers remain record-breaking at Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel. The airline made a $52 billion purchase of Boeing Co. aircraft at the 2023 edition of the air show, which takes place at Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central.",
      "FlyDubai, the lower-cost sister to Emirates, also has seen record-breaking earnings, and likely wants to expand its fleet of single-aisle aircraft. The airline currently flies 95 Boeing 737 variants, with Airbus wanting to break into the carrier's fleet. FlyDubai ordered $11 billion worth of 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners at the last air show, which when delivered will be the airline's first wide-body aircraft.",
      "Al Maktoum airport itself is on the agenda for Dubai's government. It plans a $35 billion project to expand to five parallel runways and 400 aircraft gates, to be completed within the next decade. The airport now has just two runways, like Dubai International Airport. Those additional slots coming online will help Emirates and FlyDubai grow their network, and require more aircraft to fly those routes.",

      "A new analysis of consumer data shows that more people in the United States are falling behind on their utility bills",
      "WASHINGTON -- More people are falling behind on paying their bills to keep on the lights and heat their homes, according to a new analysis of consumer data \u2014 a warning sign for the U.S. economy and another political headache for President Donald Trump.",
      "Past due balances to utility companies jumped 9.7% annually to $789 between the April-June periods of 2024 and 2025, said The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank. The increase has overlapped with a 12% jump in monthly energy bills during the same period.",
      "Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation's president. The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of information out there about rising utility costs, but here we can actually look at what that impact has been on families in terms of how they\u2019re falling behind,\" Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Troubles paying electricity and natural gas bills reflect something of an economic quandary for Trump, who is promoting the buildout of the artificial intelligence industry as a key part of an economic boom he has promised for America. But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity, and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.",
      "These troubles also come as Trump faces political pressure from voters fed up with the high cost of living.",
      "Ever since Republicans saw their fortunes sag in off-year elections this month and affordability was identified as the top issue, Trump has been trying to convince the public that prices are falling. Fast-rising electricity bills could be an issue in some congressional battlegrounds in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Trump has put a particular emphasis on prices at the pump. Gasoline accounts for about 3% of the consumer price index, slightly less than the share belonging to electricity and natural gas bills \u2014 meaning that possible savings on gasoline could be more than offset by higher utility bills.",
      "The president maintains that any troubling data on inflation is false and that Democrats are simply trying to hurt his administration's reputation.",
      "\u201cIn fact, costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down, helped greatly by gasoline and ENERGY,\" Trump posted on social media Friday. \"Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems,\u201d",
      "Nearly 6 million households have utility debt \u201cso severe\u201d that it will soon be reported to collection agencies, according to the foundation's analysis, drawn from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel.",

      "\u201cVoters are frustrated and families are hurting because these tech giants are cutting backroom deals with politicians, and it\u2019s causing their power bills to go up,\u201d said Mike Pierce, executive director of the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, which contributed to the analysis. \u201cIf the Trump administration doesn\u2019t want to do its job and protect families and make life more affordable, I guess that\u2019s its choice.\"",
      "Both Margetta Morgan and Pierce previously worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency formed in part to track trends in household borrowing to prevent potential abuses. The Trump administration has essentially shut down the bureau.",
      "The administration has so far said it has no responsibility for any increases in electricity prices, since those are often regulated by state utility boards. The White House maintains that utility costs are higher in Democratic states that rely on renewable forms of energy.",
      "\u201cElectricity prices are a state problem,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News this month. \u201cThere are things that the federal government can control. Local electricity prices are not one of them.\u201d",
      "The Century Foundation analysis counters that the Trump administration is contributing to higher utility costs \u201cby impeding renewable energy generation\" including solar and wind power.",
      "While the new analysis is a warning sign, other economic analyses on consumers suggest their finances are stable despite some emerging pressures.",
      "The New York Federal Reserve has said delinquency rates of 90 days or more for mortgages, auto loans and student debt have each increased over the past 12 months, though it said mortgage delinquencies are \u201crelatively low.\u201d An analysis of debit and credit card spending by the Bank of America Institute showed that consumers\u2019 \u201coverall financial health looks sound.\u201d",

      "Meta has started notifying young Australians to download their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram, and Threads",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Technology giant Meta on Thursday began sending thousands of young Australians a two-week warning to downland their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram and Threads before a world-first social media ban on accounts of children younger than 16 takes effect.",
      "The Australian government announced two weeks ago that the three Meta platforms plus Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders younger than 16, beginning Dec. 10.",
      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\u201cWe will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information \u201cso we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.\u201d",
      "Meta has estimated there are 350,000 Australians aged 13-to-15 on Instagram and 150,000 in that age bracket on Facebook. Australia\u2019s population is 28 million.",
      "Account holders 16-years-old and older who were mistakenly given notice that they would be excluded can contact Yoti Age Verification and verify their age by providing government-issued identity documents or a \u201cvideo selfie,\u201d Meta said.",
      "Terry Flew, co-director of Sydney University\u2019s Center for AI, Trust and Governance, said such facial-recognition technology had a failure rate of at least 5%.",
      "\u201cIn the absence of a government-mandated ID system, we\u2019re always looking at second-best solutions around these things,\u201d Flew told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "The government has warned platforms that demanding that all account holders prove they are older than 15 would be an unreasonable response to the new age restrictions. The government maintains the platforms already had sufficient data about many account holders to ascertain they were not young children.",
      "Failure to take reasonable steps to exclude young children could earn platforms fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($32 million).",

      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.",
      "Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over \u2014 often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement\u2019s radar.",
      "Once limited to policing the nation\u2019s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country\u2019s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans\u2019 daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.",
      "The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.",
      "This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration\u2019s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.",
      "The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.",
      "This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America\u2019s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.",
      "The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.",
      "The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers\u2019 behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency\u2019s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency\u2019s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.",
      "Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are \"governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,\u201d the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed \u201cto operate anywhere in the United States,\u201d the agency added.",
      "While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol\u2019s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that \u201clarge-scale surveillance technology that\u2019s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time\u201d might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.",
      "Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America\u2019s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.",
      "\u201cThey are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know \u2026 engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,\u201d Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP\u2019s findings. \u201cThese surveillance systems do not make communities safer.\u201d",
      "In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina\u2019s low country.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck\u2019s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.",
      "But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.",
      "They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash \u2014 money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.",
      "Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paqueter\u00eda El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.",
      "\u201cWe did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,\u201d said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver\u2019s name and get the trailer out of impound.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: \u201cwhisper,\u201d \u201cintel\u201d or \u201cwall\u201d stops. Those stops are meant to conceal \u2014 or wall off \u2014 that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who\u2019s traveling on America\u2019s roads and predicting who is \u201csuspicious,\u201d according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.",
      "In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff\u2019s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.",
      "Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.",
      "At Border Patrol\u2019s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff\u2019s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.",
      "\u201cThe beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there\u2019s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,\u201d said Joel Babb, the sheriff\u2019s deputy who stopped Schott\u2019s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.",
      "According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott\u2019s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott\u2019s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.",
      "Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff\u2019s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.",
      "The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles\u2019 travel patterns \u2014 based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.",
      "In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone\u2019s driver\u2019s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. \u201cNeed BP?,\u201d responded a group member whose number was labeled \u201cbp Intel.\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens\u2019 social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.",
      "In Schott\u2019s case, Babb testified that federal agents \u201cactually watch travel patterns on the highway\u201d through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: \u201cI just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.\u201d",
      "After finding nothing in Schott\u2019s car, Babb said \u201cnine times out of 10, this is what happens,\u201d a phrase Schott\u2019s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff\u2019s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.",

      "Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation\u2019s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.",
      "Border Patrol's parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers \u201dfor a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,\u201d the document states.",
      "But that\u2019s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major \u2014 and in some places permanent \u2014 fixture of the border region.",
      "In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, \u201ccollects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist \u2026 in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.\u201d Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.",
      "Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls \u201cpatterns of life\u201d of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining \u201cabnormal\u201d routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle\u2019s plates as well as its driver\u2019s face, the official said.",
      "Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field \u2014 develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.",
      "The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are \u201cread\u201d by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how, precisely the system's algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system\u2019s algorithm can flag an unusual \u201cpattern of life\u201d for human inspection.",
      "The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to \u201cDallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta\u201d before ending up south of San Antonio.",
      "Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.",
      "Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company \u201cfor now\u201d had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol\u2019s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.",
      "Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP\u2019s public records requests.",
      "CBP\u2019s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program\u2019s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas \u201cwould permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.\u201d Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.",
      "One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp\u2019s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.",
      "The Border Patrol\u2019s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.",
      "CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.",
      "Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.",
      "A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.",
      "In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol\u2019s to prioritize border security.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, \u2018Don\u2019t come here,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a \u201ccovert, mobile, License Plate Reader\u201d to pipe data to Border Patrol\u2019s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff's department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency\u2019s surveillance network.",
      "How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol\u2019s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.",
      "In Trump\u2019s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration\u2019s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.",
      "The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.",
      "\u201cWe took Alek\u2019s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,\u201d said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. \u201dWhat we found was something much larger \u2014 a system of mass surveillance that threatens people\u2019s freedom of movement.\u201d",
      "AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite \u201csuspicious\u201d travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged \u201cconducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns\u201d as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.",
      "In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase \u201csubsequent to prior knowledge\u201d when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.",
      "Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.",
      "Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.",
      "\u201cI assume for every one person like me, who\u2019s actually standing up, there\u2019s a thousand people who just don\u2019t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don\u2019t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,\u201d Schott said. \u201cI think there\u2019s thousands of people getting treated this way.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "Clinical trials, offered at major medical centers around the country, are testing two drugs now used for other autoimmune diseases to see if tamping down antibody production can ease encephalitis.",
      "More awareness of these rare diseases is critical, said North Carolina's Alexander, who sought out fellow patients. \u201cThat's a terrible feeling, feeling like you're alone.\u201d",

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Some of the estimated 20 trillion cubic feet of natural gas discovered in waters off Cyprus could reach European markets as soon as 2027, the Cypriot president said Wednesday, as Europe looks for more ways to wean itself off Russian energy.",
      "President Nikos Christodoulides said that the first quantity of natural gas that could be exported abroad will come from the so-called Cronos deposit, which is operated by a consortium made up of Italian company Eni and French firm TotalEnergies.",
      "Christodoulides told an energy conference that the consortium would make its final decision to move ahead with the project next year, with Cronos gas potentially reaching a processing plant in the Egyptian port city of Damietta for liquefaction and transportation to European markets by ship in 2027.",

      "GARDEN GROVE, Calif. -- An interactive museum dedicated to the Shroud of Turin, which some say was Jesus\u2019 burial cloth, opens its doors to the public Wednesday at the Christ Cathedral campus in Southern California.",
      "\u201cThe Shroud of Turin: An Immersive Experience,\u201d a $5-million exhibit in Garden Grove featuring 360-degree projection room theaters, Shroud of Turin replicas, interactive kiosks, and a life-size sculpture of Christ, was conceived over a span of three years and funded through private donations.",
      "The content was created primarily by Othonia, Inc., a Rome-based group dedicated to the examination of the shroud, one of the most studied artifacts in history. The original \u2014 a 14-foot-long, 3.5-foot-wide (4.3-meter-long, 1 meter-wide) cloth \u2014 is kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case housed in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy.",
      "The California museum \u2014 covering 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) \u2014 contains a life-size laminated visual of the shroud stretched over a wall. It shows the faint image of a man with wounds similar to those of Christ.",
      "The Vatican has called the cloth a powerful symbol of Christ\u2019s suffering while making no claim to its authenticity. Many experts stand by carbon-dating of scraps of the cloth that put it in the 13th or 14th century, but many faithful \u2014 some accomplished scientists among them \u2014 say the results might have been skewed by contamination, calling for larger samples to be analyzed. Many insist that the cloth contains pollen from Jerusalem and is woven in a pattern that was unique to the first century.",
      "The cloth, considered a relic by many Christians, was most recently on display in the spring of 2015. While the shroud may never leave Turin, the new exhibit will remain at least through 2030 on the Christ Cathedral campus, next to the famous glass tower and sanctuary erected by televangelist Robert H. Schuller that is now home to the Catholic Diocese of Orange.",
      "The Most Rev. Timothy Freyer, an auxiliary bishop at the diocese, said he hopes the exhibit will reinforce for visitors the power of God\u2019s love for all.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that people of faith will have stronger faith, people who are doubting will come to belief and people with no faith will begin the questioning process and then come to faith,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the highlights of the immersive experience is a re-creation of Christ\u2019s resurrection on Easter morning, with museum visitors sitting in the tomb and watching the shrouded body disappear in a flash of light. The exhibit also features replicas of the spear believed to have pierced Christ\u2019s chest and the helmet of thorns placed on his head.",
      "Philip Rizzo, a parishioner at St. Bonaventure Catholic Church in Huntington Beach who was part of a group that got a preview, said seeing these items up close created a powerful visual representation of Christ\u2019s suffering and sacrifice. Also, he said, witnessing the extensive scientific research conducted on the cloth makes the artifact more relatable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tangible beings, not just spirit and light,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cScience really helps make that connection.\u201d",
      "While some scientists have criticized the eagerness of Christians to authenticate the cloth, the new exhibit had its origins in such curiosity. Its main proponent was August Accetta, a gynecologist who opened up the Shroud Center of Southern California in 1998 and has studied the cloth's mystery for over three decades.",
      "Accetta said it was the Shroud of Turin that converted him from agnostic to Catholic. His Shroud fascination continued after meeting John Jackson, a nuclear physicist, who in 1978 led a 40-person team of scientists as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project. Their study determined that the cloth was not a manufactured work of art, but contained human bloodstains and that no known physical, chemical or biological process could adequately explain how the image on the Shroud was formed.",
      "Accetta believes, as some other scientists do, that the image was created by a burst of radiation and that a massive amount of energy is required to create the image without burning the cloth.",
      "\u201cOn the shroud, you see four centimeters of anatomically correct information encoded in two microns, which is about half the thickness of a strand of hair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t even begin to understand that, let alone reproduce it.\u201d",
      "To him, the only explanation \u2014 as the interactive exhibit illustrates \u2014 is that the body of Christ became light and the shroud simply collapsed, leaving the fine imprint of his face on the white linen.",

      "\u201cAnd then one 10,000th of a second after the discharge begins, whap! These blood stains are transferred perfectly onto the cloth,\u201d Spitzer said. \"The only explanation is that body has to disappear. I mean \u2014 like Frodo\u2019s ring \u2014 it\u2019s gone.\u201d",

He built the first flagship exhibit in Jerusalem and others in Rome, Poland, Mexico and the U.S. This latest one is the first to feature an immersive experience, which was created by a California-based studio.",

      "HONG KONG -- The Dutch government said it\u2019s relinquishing control of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia, easing a standoff between China and the Netherlands that threatened supplies of semiconductors vital for global auto manufacturing.",
      "Economics Affairs Minister Vincent Karremans said Wednesday that he was suspending an earlier order to take control of Nexperia under a rarely invoked law.",
      "The Dutch government cited national security concerns and \u201cserious governance shortcomings\u201d when it took effective control of Nexperia, which is headquartered in the city of Nijmegen but owned by China\u2019s Wingtech Technology. Officials said they were trying to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe\u2019s economic security.",
      "Nexperia chips are widely used by carmakers in North America, Japan and South Korea. Automakers warned in recent weeks that they were running low on the chips, and Honda was forced to shut down a factory in Mexico producing its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets.",
      "Karremans said he was suspending his order issued in late September as a \u201cshow of goodwill\u201d in a decision that came after \u201cconstructive meetings\u201d with Chinese authorities over the past few days.",
      "\u201cIn light of recent developments, The Netherlands has considered it the right moment to take a constructive step by suspending my order under the Goods Availability Act,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world.\"",
      "The Netherlands issued its seizure order after the United States put Wingtech on its \u201centity list\u201d of companies that face export controls, and then expanded it in September to include subsidiaries including Nexperia.",

      "While both governments have made conciliatory gestures, there were signs of tension within the company in recent days. Nexperia\u2019s Chinese unit accused the Dutch headquarters last week of halting shipments of wafers used to make chips at its assembly center in China, which it said could affect its ability to deliver finished products.",

      "The dolphin nicknamed Mimmo has been delighting tourists and Venetians for months with his acrobatic flips. Experts are now eager to move him into open water, especially after verifying wounds indicating that the dolphin had been likely hit by a boat propeller.",
      "Multiple agencies used low-intensity acoustic devices to nudge Mimmo away from the heavily trafficked St. Mark\u2019s Basin on Saturday \u2014 and it worked briefly. But the dolphin came back within an hour, as experts feared he would.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very worrying because it\u2019s a hot spot with lots of boat traffic,\u2019\u2019 said Guido Pietroluongo, a veterinarian at the University of Padua\u2019s emergency response team for stranded dolphins, whales and porpoises, known by the acronym CERT.",
      "St. Mark\u2019s Basin, the shallow expanse of water in front of St. Mark\u2019s Square connecting to both the Giudecca and Grand Canals, is heavily trafficked by ferries, vaporetti buses, water taxis, and private boats.",
      "During the failed operation, experts confirmed Mimmo had suffered superficial lesions, likely from a boat propeller, Pietroluongo said. It was the first time they had noted injuries to the dolphin, and his wounds are expected to fully heal. But experts are worried about his continued safety in such proximity to human activity.",
      "They don't plan any immediate action, and are hoping that colder seasonal temperatures will lure him, and his fish prey, out of the lagoon toward warmer waters, Pietroluongo said.",
      "Mimmo\u2019s arrival in the Venetian lagoon was registered on July 23, and experts say the coastal creature likely followed a school of fish into the brackish waters separated from the open sea by barrier islands. He was nicknamed for the sailing instructor who first spotted him off the Venetian lagoon fishing town of Chioggia.",
      "Mimmo follows the pattern of a so-called social loner, typically a young male dolphin that breaks away from the pod for food or for social reasons and then comes into contact with the human world, said Sandro Mazzariol, a CERT veterinarian.",

COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago later released a proposal with 21 options for negotiators to choose from on four sticky and interrelated issues.",

      "For technology adopters looking for the next big thing, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is the future",
      "For technology adopters looking for the next big thing, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is the future. At least, that's what the marketing pitches and tech industry T-shirts say.",
      "What makes an artificial intelligence product \u201cagentic\u201d depends on who's selling it. But the promise is usually that it's a step beyond today's generative AI chatbots.",
      "Chatbots, however useful, are all talk and no action. They can answer questions, retrieve and summarize information, write papers and generate images, music, video and lines of code. AI agents, by contrast, are supposed to be able to take actions on a person's behalf.",
      "But if you're confused, you're not alone. Google searches for \u201cagentic\u201d have skyrocketed from near obscurity a year ago to a peak earlier this fall.",
      "A new report Tuesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Consulting Group, who surveyed more than 2,000 business executives around the world, describes agentic AI as a \u201cnew class of systems\u201d that \u201ccan plan, act, and learn on their own.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not just tools to be operated or assistants waiting for instructions,\u201d says the MIT Sloan Management Review report. \"Increasingly, they behave like autonomous teammates, capable of executing multistep processes and adapting as they go.\u201d",
      "AI chatbots \u2014 such as the original ChatGPT that debuted three years ago this month \u2014 rely on systems called large language models that predict the next word in a sentence based on the huge trove of human writings they've been trained on. They can sound remarkably human, especially when given a voice, but are effectively performing a kind of word completion.",
      "That's different from what AI developers \u2014 including ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI, and tech giants like Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Salesforce \u2014 have in mind for AI agents.",
      "\u201cA generative AI-based chatbot will say, \u2018Here are the great ideas\u2019 \u2026 and then be done,\u201d said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at Amazon Web Services, in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s useful, but what makes things agentic is that it goes beyond what a chatbot does.\u201d",
      "Sivasubramanian, a longtime Amazon employee, took on his new role helping to lead work on AI agents in Amazon's cloud computing division earlier this year. He sees great promise in AI systems that can be given a \u201chigh-level goal\u201d and break it down into a series of steps and act upon them. \u201cI truly believe agentic AI is going to be one of the biggest transformations since the beginning of the cloud,\u201d he said.",
      "For most consumers, the first encounters with AI agents could be in realms like online shopping. Set a budget and some preferences and AI agents can buy things or arrange travel bookings using your credit card. In the longer run, the hope is that they can do more complex tasks with access to your computer and a set of guidelines to follow.",

      "Dietterich has some quibbles with certain companies using \u201cagentic\u201d to describe \u201cany action a computer might do, including just looking things up on the web,\u201d but he has no doubt that the technology has immense possibilities as AI systems are given the \u201cfreedom and responsibility\u201d to refine goals and respond to changing conditions as they work on people's behalf.",
      "\u201cWe can imagine a world in which there are thousands or millions of agents operating and they can form coalitions,\u201d Dietterich said. \u201cCan they form cartels? Would there be law enforcement (AI) agents?",

Tambe said he's been \u201camused\u201d by the sudden popularity of \u201cagentic\u201d as an adjective. Previously, the word describing something that has agency was mostly found in other academic fields, such as psychology or chemistry.",
      "But computer scientists have been debating what an agent is for as long as Tambe has been studying them.",
      "In the 1990s, \u201cpeople agreed that some software appeared more like an agent, and some felt less like an agent, and there was not a perfect dividing line,\u201d said Tambe, a professor at Harvard University. \u201cNonetheless, it seemed useful to use the word \u2018agent\u2019 to describe software or robotic entities acting autonomously in an environment, sensing the environment, reacting to it, planning, thinking.\u201d",
      "The prominent AI researcher Andrew Ng, co-founder of online learning company Coursera, helped advocate for popularizing the adjective \u201cagentic\u201d more than a year ago to encompass a broader spectrum of AI tasks. At the time, he also appreciated that mainly \u201ctechnical people\u201d were describing it that way.",
      "\u201cWhen I see an article that talks about \u2018agentic\u2019 workflows, I\u2019m more likely to read it, since it\u2019s less likely to be marketing fluff and more likely to have been written by someone who understands the technology,\u201d Ng wrote in a June 2024 blog post.",

      "Cities and states in the U.S. are turning to AI to improve road safety",
      "As America\u2019s aging roads fall further behind on much-needed repairs, cities and states are turning to artificial intelligence to spot the worst hazards and decide which fixes should come first.",
      "Hawaii officials, for example, are giving away 1,000 dashboard cameras as they try to reverse a recent spike in traffic fatalities. The cameras will use AI to automate inspections of guardrails, road signs and pavement markings, instantly discerning between minor problems and emergencies that warrant sending a maintenance crew.",
      "\u201cThis is not something where it\u2019s looked at once a month and then they sit down and figure out where they\u2019re going to put their vans,\u201d said Richard Browning, chief commercial officer at Nextbase, which developed the dashcams and imagery platform for Hawaii.",
      "After San Jose, California, started mounting cameras on street sweepers, city staff confirmed the system correctly identified potholes 97% of the time. Now they're expanding the effort to parking enforcement vehicles.",
      "Texas, where there are more roadway lane miles than the next two states combined, is less than a year into a massive AI plan that uses cameras as well as cellphone data from drivers who enroll to improve safety.",
      "Other states use the technology to inspect street signs or build annual reports about road congestion.",
      "Hawaii drivers over the next few weeks will be able to sign up for a free dashcam valued at $499 under the \u201cEyes on the Road\u201d campaign, which was piloted on service vehicles in 2021 before being paused due to wildfires.",
      "Roger Chen, a University of Hawaii associate professor of engineering who is helping facilitate the program, said the state faces unique challenges in maintaining its outdated roadway infrastructure.",
      "\u201cEquipment has to be shipped to the island,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a space constraint and a topography constraint they have to deal with, so it\u2019s not an easy problem.\u201d",
      "Although the program also monitors such things as street debris and faded paint on lane lines, the companies behind the technology particularly tout its ability to detect damaged guardrails.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re analyzing all guardrails in their state, every single day,\u201d said Mark Pittman, CEO of Blyncsy, which combines the dashboard feeds with mapping software to analyze road conditions.",
      "Hawaii transportation officials are well aware of the risks that can stem from broken guardrails. Last year, the state reached a $3.9 million settlement with the family of a driver who was killed in 2020 after slamming into a guardrail that had been damaged in a crash 18 months earlier but never repaired.",
      "In October, Hawaii recorded its 106th traffic fatality of 2025 \u2014 more than all of 2024. It's unclear how many of the deaths were related to road problems, but Chen said the grim trend underscores the timeliness of the dashboard program.",
      "San Jose has reported strong early success in identifying potholes and road debris just by mounting cameras on a few street sweepers and parking enforcement vehicles.",

      "Utilities are producing eye-popping forecasts about the amount of electricity they'll need to power massive new data centers that are feeding the fast-growing AI economy",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they'll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.",
      "But the challenges \u2014 some say the impossibility \u2014 of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.",
      "One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built \u2014 eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.",
      "The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that's ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.",
      "Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas \u2014 such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. \u2014 are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s speculation in there,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. \u201cNobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what\u2019s speculative, what\u2019s double-counting, what\u2019s real, what\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.",
      "Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.",
      "One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren't set in stone or lack the heft \u2014 clients, financing or otherwise \u2014 to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.",
      "Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.",
      "Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won't tell utilities if or where they've submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.",
      "The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation\u2019s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.",
      "\u201cBetter data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,\u201d the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, said it welcomed efforts to improve demand forecasting.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech giants like Google and Meta and data center developers, has urged regulators to request more information from utilities on their forecasts and to develop a set of best practices to determine the commercial viability of a data center project.",
      "The coalition's vice president of energy, Aaron Tinjum, said improving the accuracy and transparency of forecasts is a \u201cfundamental first step of really meeting this moment\u201d of energy growth.",

      "States also are trying to do more to find out what\u2019s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.",
      "In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.",
      "They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.",
      "Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren\u2019t sure if the power requests \u201care real or just speculative or somewhere in between.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.",
      "PPL Electric Utilities, which delivers power to 1.5 million customers across central and eastern Pennsylvania, projects that data centers will more than triple its peak electricity demand by 2030.",
      "Vincent Sorgi, president and CEO of PPL Corp., told analysts on an earnings call this month that the data center projects \u201care real, they are coming fast and furious\u201d and that the \u201cnear-term risk of overbuilding generation simply does not exist.\u201d",
      "The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.",
      "Still, PPL's projections helped spur a state lawmaker, Rep. Danilo Burgos, to introduce a bill to bolster the authority of state utility regulators to inspect how utilities assemble their energy demand forecasts.",

      "Researchers at an artificial intelligence firm say they've found the first reported case of foreign hackers using AI to automate portions of cyberattacks",
      "WASHINGTON -- A team of researchers has uncovered what they say is the first reported use of artificial intelligence to direct a hacking campaign in a largely automated fashion.",
      "The AI company Anthropic said this week that it disrupted a cyber operation that its researchers linked to the Chinese government. The operation involved the use of an artificial intelligence system to direct the hacking campaigns, which researchers called a disturbing development that could greatly expand the reach of AI-equipped hackers.",
      "While concerns about the use of AI to drive cyber operations are not new, what is concerning about the new operation is the degree to which AI was able to automate some of the work, the researchers said.",
      "\u201cWhile we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale,\" they wrote in their report.",
      "The operation was modest in scope and only targeted about 30 individuals who worked at tech companies, financial institutions, chemical companies and government agencies. Anthropic noticed the operation in September and took steps to shut it down and notify the affected parties.",
      "The hackers only \u201csucceeded in a small number of cases,\u201d according to Anthropic, which noted that while AI systems are increasingly being used in a variety of settings for work and leisure, they can also be weaponized by hacking groups working for foreign adversaries. Anthropic, maker of the generative AI chatbot Claude, is one of many tech companies pitching AI \u201cagents\u201d that go beyond a chatbot's capability to access computer tools and take actions on a person's behalf.",

      "Internal Pentagon figures show the number of major accidents involving military aircraft spiked in 2024",
      "WASHINGTON -- The number of major accidents involving military aircraft spiked in 2024, internal Pentagon figures show, and a series of high-profile aviation mishaps with deaths and the loss of aircraft in 2025 suggest the disturbing trend may be continuing.",
      "Across the military, the rate of severe accidents per 100,000 flight hours rose 55% in the 2024 budget year compared with four years earlier. The Marine Corps saw the highest increase, nearly tripling its rate over the same period.",
      "The data, which was released by the Defense Department to Congress and provided exclusively to The Associated Press, tracks Class A mishaps \u2014 the most serious accidents, which result in death or a permanent full disability.",
      "An aviation expert noted that broader worsening trends are unlikely the result of a single factor but rather a reflection of multiple smaller issues that accumulate to create an unsafe culture. These issues include increased operational demands, riskier aircraft like the V-22 Osprey and interruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a significant curtailing of flying time across the military.",
      "But the rising number of serious accidents has some in Congress looking for answers.",
      "The data was released to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, in January after her office asked for the figures after a spate of deadly mishaps involving the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft. Warren's office provided the data to the AP, which reviewed it independently.",
      "The statistics cover the full budget years 2020-2023 and then the first 10 months of the 2024 budget year, through July 31. In those 10 months of last year, 25 service members and Defense Department civilian employees were killed and 14 aircraft were destroyed.",
      "\u201cThese accident rates are incredibly troubling and demand action,\" Warren told the AP in an emailed statement. She said legislative changes to make accident reports more accessible \"are desperately needed so Congress can understand the root causes of these accidents to save service member lives.\u201d",
      "The Marine Corps claimed the rate of their most serious mishaps is lower than the figure the Pentagon provided to Congress in January 2025, but did not immediately provide data to back up their assertion.",
      "The Osprey, which flies like a plane but converts to land like a helicopter, has been among the most dangerous aircraft, as the AP has reported extensively.",
      "In addition, the new Defense Department data shows the Apache helicopter had about 4.5 times the rate of the most serious Class A accidents during the 2024 budget year compared with four years earlier. The C-130 transport plane, a workhorse of the military, nearly doubled its rate over the same period, even as it reported safer years in between.",
      "The Pentagon, when asked about these trends, said they \u201cunderscore the importance of safety and readiness at every level\u201d of the military and its leaders \u201cregularly review and improve our processes, share lessons learned from mishaps, and reduce safety risks.\u201d",
      "The Navy's data on just its own aviation mishaps shows a marked increase this year. The Naval Safety Command reported eight Class A aviation mishaps in 2024. In 2025, that total has spiked to 14.",
      "Aviation expert and former military pilot John Nance said the ever-growing demands being placed on military pilots are most likely playing a major part in the growing number of mishaps.",
      "\u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about the end of Afghanistan, whether we talk about deployments to Djibouti, or the back and forth across Saudi Arabia to get to the Emirates, I think that as the pace (of military operations) ticks up, the mishaps are going to tick up,\u201d Nance said.",

      "Investigations found that the Black Hawk helicopter\u2019s altimeter gauge was broken, there were issues with the military pilot's night vision goggles, and the Federal Aviation Administration didn't address warnings about the dangers that helicopters presented in the area around the Washington airport.",
      "Unlike their civilian counterparts, military aviators face far less predictability and routine when they fly, Nance said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got aircraft commanders ... making decisions with the best information they\u2019ve got, but on the spur of the moment and there\u2019s a level of uncertainty and a level of unpredictability that is wildly beyond anything the commercial airlines experience,\u201d he said.",

      "Nance didn't rule out the possibility that this spike in mishaps is the downstream effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, when military pilots had far less flying time.",
      "\u201cThe safety buffer is impacted by a million things,\u201d Nance said. Some things make tiny impacts and others are major. According to him, the pandemic \u201cwas a major impact on the operational capabilities.\u201d",
      "Warren's office is now asking for more detailed figures from the Pentagon on aviation mishaps and over a longer period of time, from 2019 to 2025, according to a request sent to the Pentagon and reviewed by the AP. The request includes questions about Class A mishaps but asks for data on the less serious Class B and C mishaps as well.",

      "Medicaid cuts are being blamed for the closure of a community health center in New Hampshire\u2019s White Mountains",
      "FRANCONIA, N.H. -- The closing of a health center in rural New Hampshire has raised concerns that the projected cuts in Medicaid are already taking a toll.",
      "Last month, a site of the Ammonoosuc Community Health Services in Franconia, a town of around 1,000 people, closed for good.",
      "Ammonoosuc officials and a Democratic senator have blamed Medicaid cuts for the closure of the facility that served 1,400 patients from Franconia, Easton, Lincoln and Sugar Hill. These are all tiny communities around the White Mountains, whose patients typically are older and sicker than in other parts of the state.",
      "The closure of the Franconia center reflects the financial struggles facing community health centers and rural health care systems more broadly amid Medicaid cuts and a feared spike in health insurance rates. The government shutdown, which ended last week, was driven by a Democratic demand to extend tax credits, which ensure low- and middle-income people can afford health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, or ACA.",
      "More than 100 hospitals closed over the past decade, according to the Center For Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a policy and advocacy group, and more than 700 more hospitals are at risk of closure. A branch of the HealthFirst Family Care Center, a facility in Canaan, New Hampshire also announced it was closing at the end of October due in part to \u201cchanges in Medicaid reimbursement and federal funding\u201d for these facilities.",
      "On average, the federally-funded community health centers like the one in Franconia are losing money, relying heavily on cash reserves, making service changes and sometimes closing locations to stay afloat, NACHC found. Nearly half have less than 90 days\u2019 cash on hand, according to the association. And the future is even more bleak with at least 2 million community health center patients expected to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 and 2 million more who are newly uninsured turning to the centers for care.",
      "Ed Shanshala, the CEO of Ammonoosuc, said the Medicaid cuts are to blame for the closure of the Franconia center.",
      "Shanshala runs a network of five health centers in New Hampshire which relies more than $2 million in federal funding \u2014 out of a $12 million budget. He faced a $500,000 shortfall due to the cuts and realized closing Franconia would save about half that money. It also was the only facility where they leased space.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re really left with no choice,\u201d Shanshala said, adding the closure would save $250,000. Finding additional cuts is hard, given that the centers provide services to anyone under 200% of federal poverty levels, he said. And if he cuts additional services, Shanshala fears some patients will end up in a hospital emergency room or \u201cstop engaging in health care period.\u201d",
      "Susan Bushby, a 70-year-old housekeeper, talked about how much she loved the staff and feared going to a new health center. She wouldn't know her way around a larger facility and wouldn't have the same rapport with the people there.",

      "Children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups are urging parents not to buy AI-powered toys during the holiday season",
      "They\u2019re cute, even cuddly, and promise learning and companionship \u2014 but artificial intelligence toys are not safe for kids, according to children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups urging parents not to buy them during the holiday season.",
      "These toys, marketed to kids as young as 2 years old, are generally powered by AI models that have already been shown to harm children and teenagers, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, according to an advisory published Thursday by the children\u2019s advocacy group Fairplay and signed by more than 150 organizations and individual experts such as child psychiatrists and educators.",
      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural that for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for more than 10 years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAn AI toy collapses that work. It answers instantly, smoothly, and often better than a human would. We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agent\u2014but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",

      "Another company, Miko, said it uses its own conversational AI model rather than relying on general large language model systems such as ChatGPT in order to make their product \u2014 an interactive AI robot \u2014 safe for children.",
      "\u201cWe are always expanding our internal testing, strengthening our filters, and introducing new capabilities that detect and block sensitive or unexpected topics,\" said CEO Sneh Vaswani. \u201cThese new features complement our existing controls that allow parents and caregivers to identify specific topics they\u2019d like to restrict from conversation. We will continue to invest in setting the highest standards for safe, secure and responsible AI integration for Miko products.\u201d",

      "Ritvik Sharma, the company's senior vice president of growth, said Miko actually \u201cencourages kids to interact more with their friends, to interact more with the peers, with the family members etc. It\u2019s not made for them to feel attached to the device only.\u201d",
      "Still, Suskind and children's advocates say analog toys are a better bet for the holidays.",
      "\"Kids need lots of real human interaction. Play should support that, not take its place. The biggest thing to consider isn\u2019t only what the toy does; it\u2019s what it replaces. A simple block set or a teddy bear that doesn\u2019t talk back forces a child to invent stories, experiment, and work through problems. AI toys often do that thinking for them,\" she said. \u201cHere\u2019s the brutal irony: when parents ask me how to prepare their child for an AI world, unlimited AI access is actually the worst preparation possible.\u201d",

      "Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has abruptly gone on leave from teaching at Harvard University over recently released emails showing he maintained a friendly relationship with Jeffrey Epstein",
      "Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers abruptly went on leave Wednesday from teaching at Harvard University, where he once served as president, over recently released emails showing he maintained a friendly relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, Summers' spokesperson said.",
      "Summers had canceled his public commitments amid the fallout of the emails being made public and earlier Wednesday severed ties with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Harvard had reopened an investigation into connections between him and Epstein, but Summers had said he would continue teaching economics classes at the school.",
      "That changed Wednesday evening with the news that he will step away from teaching classes as well as his position as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government with the Harvard Kennedy School.",
      "\u201cMr. Summers has decided it\u2019s in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review,\" Summers spokesperson Steven Goldberg said, adding that his co-teachers would finish the classes.",
      "Summers has not been scheduled to teach next semester, according to Goldberg.",
      "A Harvard spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press that Summers had let the university know about his decision. Summers decision to go on leave was first reported by The Harvard Crimson.",
      "Harvard did not mention Summers by name in its decision to restart an investigation, but the move follows the release of emails showing that he was friendly with Epstein long after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008.",
      "By Wednesday, the once highly regarded economics expert had been facing increased scrutiny over choosing to stay in the teaching role. Some students even filmed his appearance in shock as he appeared before a class of undergraduates on Tuesday while stressing he thought it was important to continue teaching.",
      "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, said in a social media post on Wednesday night that Summers \u201ccozied up to the rich and powerful \u2014 including a convicted sex offender. He cannot be trusted in positions of influence.\u201d",
      "The emails include messages in which Summers appeared to be getting advice from Epstein about pursuing a romantic relationship with someone who viewed him as an \u201ceconomic mentor.\u201d",
      "\u201cim a pretty good wing man , no?\u201d Epstein wrote on Nov. 30, 2018.",
      "The next day, Summers told Epstein he had texted the woman, telling her he \u201chad something brief to say to her.\u201d",
      "\u201cAm I thanking her or being sorry re my being married. I think the former,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Summers\u2019 wife, Elisa New, also emailed Epstein multiple times, including a 2015 message in which she thanked him for arranging financial support for a poetry project she directs. The gift he arranged \u201cchanged everything for me,\u201d she wrote.",

      "An earlier review completed in 2020 found that Epstein visited Harvard\u2019s campus more than 40 times after his 2008 sex-crimes conviction and was given his own office and unfettered access to a research center he helped establish. The professor who provided the office was later barred from starting new research or advising students for at least two years.",
      "On Tuesday, Summers appeared before his class at Harvard, where he teaches \u201cThe Political Economy of Globalization\u201d to undergraduates with Robert Lawrence, a professor with the Harvard Kennedy School.",
      "\u201cSome of you will have seen my statement of regret expressing my shame with respect to what I did in communication with Mr. Epstein and that I\u2019ve said that I\u2019m going to step back from public activities for a while. But I think it\u2019s very important to fulfill my teaching obligations,\" he said.",
      "Summers' remarks were captured on video by several students, but no one appeared to publicly respond to his comments.",
      "Epstein, who authorities said died by suicide in 2019, was a convicted sex offender infamous for his connections to wealthy and powerful people, making him a fixture of outrage and conspiracy theories about wrongdoing among American elites.",
      "Summers served as treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. He was Harvard\u2019s president for five years from 2001 to 2006. When asked about the emails last week, Summers issued a statement saying he has \u201cgreat regrets in my life\u201d and that his association with Epstein was a \u201cmajor error in judgement.\u201d",
      "Other organizations that confirmed the end of their affiliations with Summers included the Center for American Progress, the Center for Global Development and the Budget Lab at Yale University. Bloomberg TV said Summers\u2019 withdrawal from public commitments included his role as a paid contributor, and the New York Times said it will not renew his contract as a contributing opinion writer.",

The offices of Alaska's Republican congressional delegation members have said the resolution \u201cfulfills the objectives\u201d of an Alaska-specific executive order signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

      "\u201cBlack shirt? Let me know if the judge dismissed,\u201d an ICE agent texted during one hearing.",
      "Almost from the outset, immigration courts were plagued by a lack of resources, authority and judicial independence.",
      "The courts were established in 1952, but it was not until 1973 that \u201cspecial inquiry officers\u201d were given the \u201cjudge\u201d title and allowed to wear judicial robes. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, was created in 1983. But that agency remained a part of the Justice Department, giving the attorney general authority to override decisions.",
      "\u201cWe were a legal Cinderella,\u201d said Dana Leigh Marks, who retired as an immigration judge in 2021 after a 34-year career. \u201cNo other court in the nation functions like this.\u201d",
      "The first Trump administration undertook a series of changes to reduce the case backlog, including instructing judges to deny entire categories of asylum claims such as for victims of gang or domestic violence.",
      "It also set up a dashboard that would become the bane of many judges: Red, yellow and green gauges measure each judge\u2019s performance on goals ranging from completed cases \u2014 a minimum of 700 annually, regardless of complexity \u2014 to how many custody cases were decided on their first hearings.",
      "To meet the metrics, judges must race through dockets, sometimes devoting mere minutes to evaluate asylum-seekers' claims.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like deciding death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,\u201d Marks said.",
      "When Trump returned to the White House in January, his allies took direct aim at the court.",
      "Since then, the Justice Department has issued 52 policy memos \u2014 more than the previous six years combined \u2014 making it easier to hire and fire judges and warning against pro-migrant bias.",
      "The memos highlight the courts\u2019 weakened status by referring to judges as \u201cinferior officers\u201d \u2014 a rarely used term taken from the Constitution.",
      "In early September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would lend 600 military lawyers to the immigration courts, about equal to the current number of judges. The goal, according to the administration, is to more effectively reduce caseloads by widening the pool of potential judges to include people already steeped in administrative law. But many migrant advocates are concerned the incoming judges lack the necessary experience to decide asylum cases.",
      "\u201cIt makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement,\u201d said Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.",
      "The administration has pushed back against criticism it is co-opting the courts to accelerate its deportation goals. In a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said DHS decides whether to arrest migrants and that most judges consider it an \u201chonor rather than an insult\u201d to be called an inferior officer empowered by the Constitution and serving at the will of the attorney general.",
      "Baldassarre likened a record surge of asylum seekers during the Biden administration to an \u201cimproper conspiracy between DHS and the Immigration Courts to effectuate an unlawful amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.\u201d The Justice Department, she said, had \"restored the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the Courts.\u201d",
      "DHS did not respond to repeated email and phone requests for comment.",
      "For some inside the courts, work has become a stressful, lonesome grind. Fear prevails. Resumes are being updated.",
      "One DHS lawyer described being haunted at night by the sound of jangling shackles of migrants the lawyer helped arrest. The lawyer joined the government after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, believing that protecting America\u2019s borders was a patriotic duty.",
      "The lawyer still cherishes a signed copy of Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel\u2019s memoir \u201cNight,\u201d which was handed out at a work seminar. \u201cThink higher, feel deeper,\u201d reads the author\u2019s inscription of the book, which is marked DHS \u201cTraining Material.\u201d",
      "Today, its message torments.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t what any of us signed up for,\u201d the lawyer said.",
      "After a turbulent summer, the courthouses are starting to look lonely, too. With word spreading that a trap had been laid, many migrants, fearing arrest, are asking to appear online or are skipping hearings altogether.",
      "Meanwhile, ambitious managers are publicly upbraiding those who raise doubts about the legality of locking up migrants with no criminal record in packed facilities. In a recent town hall with DHS principal legal adviser Charles Wall, several lawyers complained about the pressure, confusing orders and lack of resources, according to notes from the meeting shared with AP.",

      "The lodgelike medical building, which sits on a hill overlooking town, was like a second home for Bushby and many other patients. The front desk staff knew their names and never missed a chance to celebrate a birthday or anniversary. Staff photos of the wilderness that makes this place such a draw hung on the walls, and bumping into a neighbor in the waiting room was routine.",
      "But last month, this site of the Ammonoosuc Community Health Services in Franconia, a town of around 1,000 people, closed for good.",
      "Officials blamed cuts in Medicaid, the federal program that millions of low-income Americans rely on for health care. The 1,400 patients, almost half of them older and some facing serious health challenges like cancer and early stage dementia, must now drive at least 10 miles (16 kilometers) along rural roads to reach the nearest health center, which also is near a regional hospital. A second center is twice as far.",

      "The closure of the Franconia center reflects the financial struggles facing community health centers and rural health care systems more broadly amid Medicaid cuts and a feared spike in health insurance rates. The government shutdown, which ended last week, was driven by a Democratic demand to extend tax credits, which ensure low- and middle-income people can afford health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, or ACA.",

      "More than 100 hospitals closed over the past decade, according to the Center For Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a policy and advocacy group, and more than 700 more hospitals are at risk of closure. A branch of the HealthFirst Family Care Center, a facility in Canaan, New Hampshire, also announced it was closing at the end of October due in part to \u201cchanges in Medicaid reimbursement and federal funding\" for these facilities.",
      "\u201cBecause of these Medicaid cuts, we\u2019re going to see rural hospitals, in particular, hit hard,\u201d New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd obviously, the failure to extend the ACA tax credits right now is going to compound the problem. ... These providers are going to see more and more uninsured patients. And that means they\u2019re going to have to make really difficult decisions.\u201d",
      "The sustainability of the centers is critical, because they serve as the nation\u2019s primary care safety net, treating patients regardless of insurance coverage or ability to pay.",
      "Though federally-funded community health centers like the one in Franconia have expanded their reach in recent years, treating 1 in 10 Americans and 1 in 5 rural Americans, they\u2019ve often done so in the face of major financial constraints, according to data from the National Association of Community Health Centers.",
      "On average, the centers are losing money, relying heavily on cash reserves, making service changes and sometimes closing locations to stay afloat, NACHC found. Nearly half have less than 90 days' cash on hand, according to the association. And the future is even more bleak with at least 2 million community health center patients expected to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 and 2 million more who are newly uninsured turning to the centers for care.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to trim without cutting into care itself,\" said Peter Shin, the chief science officer at the association.",

He also expected work requirements in the bill and spikes in health insurance premiums to have an impact.",
      "Shanshala knew he needed to make some cuts to save his centers and zeroed in on Franconia because the building was leased, whereas it owns the other facilities.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really left with no choice,\u201d Shanshala said, adding the closure would save $250,000. Finding additional cuts is hard, given the centers provide services to anyone under 200% of federal poverty levels, he said.

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Archaeologists have identified more than a dozen ancient canoes that Indigenous people apparently left behind in a sort of prehistoric parking lot along a Wisconsin lakeshore.",
      "The Wisconsin Historical Society announced Wednesday that archaeologists have mapped the location of 16 canoes submerged in the lake bed of Lake Mendota in Madison. Tamara Thomsen, the state's maritime archaeologist, said that the site lies near a network of what were once indigenous trails, suggesting ancient people left the canoes there for anyone to use as they traveled, much like a modern-day e-bike rack.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a parking spot that\u2019s been used for millennia, over and over,\u201d Thomsen said.",
      "Lake Mendota is a sprawling, 15-square-mile (38.8-square-kilometer) body of water on Madison's west side. The state Capitol building and the University of Wisconsin-Madison are located on an isthmus that runs between it and Lake Monona, a 5-square-mile (13-square-kilometer) lake to the east.",
      "The discoveries began in 2021 when archaeologists uncovered the remains of a 1,200-year-old canoe submerged in 24 feet of water in Lake Mendota. The following year they found the remains of a 3,000-year-old canoe, a 4,500-year-old canoe under it and a 2,000-year-old canoe next to it, alerting researchers that there was probably more to the site than they expected.",
      "Working with Sissel Schroeder, a UW-Madison professor who specializes in Native American cultures, and preservation officers with the Ho-Chunk Nation and the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Thomsen has now located the remains of 12 additional canoes, Thomsen said.",
      "Radiocarbon dating shows the oldest of the 16 canoes dates back to 5,200 years ago, making it the third oldest canoe discovered in eastern North America, she said. The two oldest were found in Florida, with the oldest of them dating back 7,000 years, Thomsen said.",

      "Wisconsin experienced a drought beginning about 7,500 years ago and lasting to around 1000 B.C., Thomsen said. The lake in the area where the canoes were found was probably only 4 feet (1.2 meters) deep over that period, she said, making it a good place to disembark for foot travel. The canoes likely were shared among community members and stored at designated points like the Lake Mendota site. Users would typically bury the canoes in sediment in waist- to chest-deep water so they wouldn't dry out or prevent them from freezing, Thomsen said.",
      "Travelers may have been headed to Lake Wingra, a 321-acre (130-hectare) lake on Madison's south side, Dr. Amy Rosebrough, the state archaeologist, said. The Madison area is part of the ancestral homeland of the Ho-Chunk Nation, which views one of the springs that feeds Lake Wingra as a portal to the spirit world, she said.",
      "\u201cThe canoes remind us how long our people have lived in this region and how deeply connected we remain to these waters and lands,\u201d Bill Quackenbush, the Ho-Chunk's tribal preservation officer, said in a news release.",
      "Thomsen speculated that if the drought did begin 7,500 years and archaeologists are finding canoes beneath other canoes, they may eventually find a 7,000-year-old canoe in the lake. That could mean Indigenous people that predated many of Wisconsin's tribes may have used the lake, she said.",
      "Thomsen spends most of her days uncovering Great Lakes shipwrecks and works on the canoe project only one day per week. But she called that work the most impactful she has ever done as an archaeologist because she engages with Wisconsin tribes, learns their history and tells their stories.",
      "\u201cI think I've shed more tears over this,\u201d she said. \u201cTalking with the Indigenous people, sometimes I sit here and just get goose bumps. It just feels like (the work is) making a difference. Each one of these canoes gives us another clue to the story.\u201d",

      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria.

If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",

      "The House Ethics Committee has announced that a panel will conduct a wide-ranging investigation into Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla",
      "WASHINGTON -- The House Ethics Committee announced Wednesday that it will conduct a wide-ranging investigation into Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., including whether he violated campaign finance laws, misused congressional resources and engaged in sexual misconduct or dating violence.",
      "Mills, now serving his second term, was ordered last month by a Florida judge to have no contact with his ex-girlfriend and to not go within 500 feet of her residence or where she works. Mills also is prohibited from referring to her on social media. The order is in effect through the end of the year, and any violation can result in a fine or imprisonment. The judge in the case said he had concluded that the woman was either a victim of dating violence or in danger of becoming one.",
      "The Ethics Committee made clear that it would be looking at numerous allegations involving Mills. The panel will also examine whether he failed to properly disclose required information on statements required to be filed with the House, violated campaign finance laws regarding his two congressional campaigns, and whether he improperly solicited or received gifts in connection with privately sponsored official travel.",
      "The mere fact that an investigative subcommittee was formed does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, the Ethics Committee noted.",
      "Mills said he looked forward to working with the Ethics Committee.",
      "\u201cI believe that all the accusations and false things that are being said will be proven to be absolutely false in many ways,\u201d Mills said from the House floor. \u201cI have the evidence and receipts and look forward to working with them.\u201d",

      "The Council of Nicaea is important both for what was done and how it was done.",
      "It involved an unprecedented gathering of at least 250 bishops from around the Roman Empire. Emperor Constantine had consolidated control over the empire after years of civil war and political intrigues.",
      "Constantine wouldn\u2019t formally convert to Christianity until the end of his life. But by 325, he had already been showing tolerance and favor toward a Christian sect that had emerged from the last great spasm of Roman persecution.",

      "If you felt a personal connection with a celebrity this year, you likely weren't alone.",
      "That feeling led Cambridge Dictionary to select \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year. Parasocial is defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",
      "It's an academic term that has only been around for about 70 years, but it has now become mainstream, said Colin McIntosh, the lexical program manager for Cambridge Dictionary.",
      "\"Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise,\" McIntosh said in a statement. \"The data reflects that, with the Cambridge Dictionary website seeing spikes in lookups for 'parasocial.'\"",
      "A recent example of this happened when pop star Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce announced their engagement. Many fans who have been captivated by Swift's lyrics for years celebrated the moment despite not actually knowing her or Kelce.",
      "But parasocial relationships can become problematic, Simone Schnall, a professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, said.",
      "\"We've entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,\" Schnall said. \"This leads to a sense that people 'know' those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it's completely one sided.\"",
      "The trend is also evolving to include artificial intelligence.",

      "YouTuber and social media influencer Jack Doherty was arrested for drug possession and other charges in Miami Beach after he was found disrupting traffic to allegedly film social media content, police said.",
      "Miami Beach Police announced that the 22-year-old was taken into custody early Saturday on multiple charges, including possessing amphetamine and marijuana, along with resisting an officer without violence.",
      "\"The Miami Beach Police Department remains steadfast in its commitment to maintain public safety and order throughout the city\u2014regardless of celebrity status,\" the agency said. \"The Department will continue to take proactive enforcement action against behavior that endangers residents, visitors, or officers and will hold all individuals accountable under the law.\"",
      "Later Saturday night, Doherty posted a TikTok video showing him bonding out of jail with the caption \"I got arrested last night and now I'm free.\"",
      "\"I'm a free man, baby,\" he said in the video, while holding the property bag that held his personal items at the time of his arrest. \"Let's go.\"",
      "According to his bio on Delka Talents, his talent agency, Doherty has over 3.2 million YouTube subscribers and over 500 million YouTube views. Doherty is best known for filming \"daredevil\" stunts and pranks, and his most-watched video has over 18 million views as of March 2018, his bio said.",
      "CBS News Miami has reached out to Doherty's representatives for comment on his arrest.",
      "An influencer blocks traffic for the sake of \"content\"",
      "Around 3:12 a.m. Saturday, Miami Beach Police officers were conducting a high-visibility detail along the 700 block of Washington Avenue within the city's Entertainment District, when a group of individuals entered the roadway from the east sidewalk into the northbound lanes. A man from the group -- later identified as Doherty -- separated from them and attempted to engage officers to \"create video content, positioning himself in the middle of the roadway with passing vehicular traffic and creating a significant safety hazard,\" according to arrest documents obtained by CBS News Miami.",
      "Miami Beach Police officers began issuing multiple commands to direct Doherty to exit the roadway, but he refused. Even after his group urged him to comply, he continued refusing officers' commands.",
      "Officers continued, warning Doherty that failure to comply would result in his arrest. Still, the influencer continued to refuse commands and told them, \"Once I'm done with this bet,\" the arrest documents said. At this moment, Miami Beach Police safely apprehended Doherty in the middle of the road due to his \"deliberate refusal to follow lawful orders and continued to obstruct traffic.\"",
      "According to arrest documents, while officers searched Doherty's person, they found \"half of an orange oval-shaped pill with 3 imprinted on it, consistent with a Schedule II amphetamine, as well as a black plastic container holding three hand-rolled suspected cannabis cigarettes weighing approximately 4.0 grams combined.\"",
      "After a records check that showed no active warrants, officers took Doherty to Miami Beach Police's holding facility for booking and contacted an after-hours attorney for charging guidance.",

      "In \"Defying Gravity: The Creative Career of Stephen Schwartz, from Godspell to Wicked\" (published by Applause Books), biographer Carol de Giere explores the life and work of the Grammy- and Oscar-winning composer of treasured Broadway and movie hits.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which Schwartz finds the inspiration of what will become his most successful musical production to date, when he discovers Gregory Maguire's prequel to L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" \u2013 the genesis of the long-running Broadway musical \"Wicked.\"",
      "And don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Stephen Schwartz on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 16!",
      "\"Defying Gravity\" by Carol de Giere",
      "Landing in Oz",
      "\"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap!\" \u2014Wicked",
      "At the start of 1996, Stephen Schwartz never imagined he would end the year envisioning his next Broadway musical, Wicked. Movie songwriting seemed to be his future, especially after one eventful evening in March. He donned his newly-purchased black tuxedo and white silk dress shirt, strode across the red carpet, and met up with his Pocahontas writing partner Alan Menken at Los Angeles' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. For forty-eight-year-old Schwartz, being nominated for an Academy Award was a welcome twist on his childhood dream of writing musicals for the stage. With his parents and wife in the audience, he waited for the announcement.",
      "\"And the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score goes to\u2026\" An expectant silence settled in the hall while presenter Quincy Jones opened the envelope.",
      "\"Alan Menken, musical and orchestral score, and Stephen Schwartz, lyrics, for Pocahontas.\" Applause burst out while the pair made their way to the stage. As Menken thanked their Pocahontas music team, Schwartz clutched his golden statuette and smiled, looking down at Mel Gibson in the front row making funny faces at him and soaking in the acknowledgment from Hollywood. That evening he and Menken also stepped up to accept the award for Best Original Song, \"Colors of the Wind.\"",
      "Back home in Connecticut, he placed his gold-plated statuettes beside his Grammy gramophones in a trophy case converted from an aquarium that his kids no longer used.",
      "The rest of the year was a busy one, with the premiere of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and early work on The Prince of Egypt involving meetings with the DreamWorks team and the writing and demo-ing of songs. He was also working on an early production of a revue musical Snapshots in Seattle, confident that when finally finished, the show would go direct to stock and amateur licensing rather than to a commercial production. The one thing he was emphatically not doing was planning anything new for Broadway.",
      "Then towards the end of the year, a phone call came that would change everything. He was in Los Angeles finishing some work on The Prince of Egypt when his long-time buddy, songwriter John Bucchino, called him from the island of Maui in Hawaii. Singer-songwriter Holly Near had hired Bucchino as a piano accompanist for her performances at a conference at the tropical getaway. Once on Maui, Bucchino decided it was too good not to share. His room included an extra bed, and he had a car and free food. \"If you can cash in some frequent flyer miles and come for the weekend, you'll have a free vacation in Hawaii,\" Bucchino offered.",
      "\"Why not?\" thought Schwartz. He had the weekend free, and after all, it was Hawaii. \"I am so there,\" came Schwartz's answer from LA, and by December 16th, he was.",
      "When Bucchino and Near had a block of time away from the stage, they organized a snorkeling adventure with Schwartz and Near's friend, Pat Hunt. A small boat sped them over to Molikini, a mostly submerged volcanic crater popular for its rainbow spread of sea creatures that delight snorkelers.",
      "On the trip back, Holly casually mentioned to Stephen, \"I'm reading this really interesting book called Wicked, by Gregory Maguire.\"",
      "The novel's title sounded intriguing. \"I think I've heard of it. What's it about?\" he inquired.",
      "\"It's the Oz story from the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view.\"",
      "In an instant, Schwartz's imagination flashed through the implications of a backstory for The Wizard of Oz told from the perspective of the unpopular witch. His reaction was visceral: \"All the hairs on my arms stood on end,\" he recalls. \"I thought it was the best idea for a musical I had ever heard.\"",
      "As soon as he returned to his LA apartment, he called his attorney in New York, inquiring about Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. \"Okay, this book has been out for a while, so somebody has the rights. I need you to find out who has them. Meanwhile, I'm going to get the book and read it, because I think I have to do this.\"",
      "There was no way around it. This was a Broadway concept not suited to a small-budget theater company. And he knew it was a highly theatrical idea, not one meant for film or television. Although he had firmly decided, indeed pledged, never to work on Broadway again, his instincts didn't leave him a choice.",
      "But with such a popular novel, surely someone in Hollywood was converting it to the silver screen. Schwartz would have to stop them, and somehow inspire the rights holders to consider instead the risky, expensive, and time-consuming venture of producing a musical in New York City.",
      "While his attorney, Nancy Rose, followed clues on the rights trail, Wicked's prospective composer-lyricist read the novel and confirmed that his hunch had been right: musicalizing the Wicked Witch's story seemed \"quintessentially an idea for me,\" meaningful enough to be worth the potential struggle.",
      "For one thing, he loved looking at traditional stories from a new angle. When he was in college he saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard's play in which two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet are made the central characters. \"It was a revelation to me,\" he recalls. \"From that point on, the idea of looking at familiar material from an unfamiliar point of view became a goal for my own work.\" Godspell had approached the New Testament in a fresh way, Children of Eden reworked Genesis for a new take on family life, and The Prince of Egypt explored the Exodus story from the standpoint of the brother relationship between Moses and Ramses. But Gregory Maguire's twist on The Wizard of Oz was a chance to do something more directly like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern concept. \"I recognized immediately that this was a genius idea and that it was an idea for me: the way it took a familiar subject and spun it,\" Schwartz recalls.",
      "Wicked also felt inherently musical to him. \"Elphaba is a very musical character with big emotions. She is fantastical. The world is fantastical. Glinda is very musical.\" To him it was clear that the world of musical theater was where the story belonged.",
      "And then there was the character Maguire's vision had moved to the center of the story: Elphaba, the quirky and misunderstood green girl who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Maguire named her after L. Frank Baum, who penned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, when he pondered the sound of the author's initials \"eL\" \"Fa\" \"Ba.\" Elphaba's story seemed close to Schwartz's own emotional experience. He knew what it felt like to be \"green\" and what inner resources are needed to carry on with life. \"The idea of the story created a sympathetic resonance in me,\" Schwartz affirms, \"and I know that I'm not alone. Anyone who is an artist in our society is going to identify with Elphaba. Anyone who is of an ethnic minority, who is black or Jewish or gay, or a woman feeling she grew up in a man's world, or anyone who grew up feeling a dissonance between who they are inside and the world around them, will identify with Elphaba. Since that's so many of us, I think there will be a lot of people who will.\"",
      "\"There were things that I knew right away. I knew how it was going to begin, I knew how it was going to end, I knew who Elphaba was, and I knew why\u2014 on some strange level\u2014this was autobiographical even though it was about a green girl in Oz.\" \u2014Stephen Schwartz",
      "Schwartz bought a spiral notebook in which he would capture all his story and lyric ideas\u2014snatches of inspiration, research notes, lists of rhyming words, first drafts of lyric lines, and later drafts. On the black cover, the manufacturer's slogan, \"Five Star\u2014In a Class By Itself,\" hinted at what would become of the musical that began as penciled scrawls on the lined pages.",
      "Maguire had created, as the author himself described it, a dense, almost nineteenth-century-type novel that takes place over thirty-eight years and has thirty-eight speaking parts. Could any group of musical collaborators successfully distill these ingredients into a viable evening of theater?",

    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

      "Schwartz has been telling stories through song for over five decades. \"My sort of glib joke where people say, like, how do you write a song? I just say, tell the truth and make it rhyme,\" he said. \"And if I can be honest enough, then that'll speak to other people.\"",
      "\"Wicked\" opened 22 years ago, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway show in history.",
      "And where was Schwartz on the night of Oct. 30, 2003? \"Well, that was the opening night of 'Wicked' on Broadway, and therefore, I was not at the Gershwin Theatre, because I don't go to my own openings,\" he said. \"It's too nerve-wracking for me. I don't like the opening night parties where everybody is just waiting to hear what reviews come in.\"",
      "Kristin Chenoweth originated the role of Glinda on Broadway. She and Schwartz have reunited for the recently-opened new musical, \"The Queen of Versailles.\" \"I'm working with my Rodgers and Hammerstein; it's just packed into one person,\" she said of Schwartz. \"There's not five of him. There's one. He's original. He's singular. And there's nobody else like him.\"",
      "Schwartz grew up on New York's Long Island. A prodigy, he attended the prestigious Juilliard School as a high schooler. Just after college, he collaborated on the musical that became his first big hit, \"Godspell.\" The musical features a ragtag group who help Jesus tell various parables.",
      "I asked, \"It's a musical with Jesus as a central character. You're a Jewish guy. Did you think, well, alright, I'll give it a go?\"",
      "Schwartz replied, \"I think one of the things that made 'Godspell' work was the fact that I didn't know a lot of those stories. So, I think I came to it with a kind of fresh eye about not preaching to the converted, so to speak.\"",
      "In 1972, Schwartz brought that fresh eye to the story of \"Pippin,\" a young man searching for the meaning of life in the Middle Ages. Hit #3, 1974's \"The Magic Show,\" starred magician Doug Henning. Schwartz was 3-for-3, with all three playing simultaneously on Broadway when he was just 27 \u2013 a theatrical trifecta that Schwartz described as \"very dizzying.\"",
      "\"The truth is, when you are very young and unprepared for a success, it can be difficult to handle,\" he said. \"It was difficult for me to handle. I think I got very, quite full of myself. I got kind of difficult to deal with. I kept thinking, well, why isn't everybody just doing exactly what I say? I lost somewhat the ability to collaborate. You know, it took some failures to kind of learn how to deal with both success and failure.\"",
      "The failures came in short order, a \"four-fecta\" of flops\": \"Working\" (which closed after a month), and 'Rags\" (which closed after four performances), while \"The Baker's Wife\" and \"Children of Eden\" never made it to Broadway.",
      "I noted, \"You haven't always been critic's choice.\"",
      "\"I'm almost never a critic's choice,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Why? \"I have no idea,\" he said. \"I'll be frank about it, you know, I wish I got Steve Sondheim's reviews.\"",
      "\"But listen, as great as he was, his shows didn't run the way yours have.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the grass is always greener,\" Schwartz replied.",
      "In the early 1990s Schwartz stepped away from the piano. Had he quit Broadway? \"Absolutely, a hundred percent,\" he said.",
      "\"Did you worry that you were out of juice?\" I asked.",
      "\"Totally, yeah. And in the '90s, I actually went back to school. I was pursuing a degree in psychology. I was gonna become a therapist.\"",
      "Studying to become a therapist turned out to be quite therapeutic. \"I think that time away reminded me of how to behave myself and how to collaborate and how to deal with other people, and not just come in like a bull in a china shop,\" he said.",
      "When he returned to songwriting, it was not for Broadway, though, but for Hollywood, writing songs for \"Pocahontas,\" \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" \"Enchanted,\" and music and lyrics for \"The Prince of Egypt.\" He picked up three Academy Awards along the way.",
      "\"The Colors of the Wind,\" from \"Pocahontas\":",
      "But Stephen Schwartz's home will always be the stage. \"I feel so blessed and so fortunate that work I've done has this ongoing life that I know is gonna keep going when I'm not here on this planet anymore,\" he said. \"Listen, I'm 77 years old, and they still let me do this!\"",

      "The Vatican shared the spotlight with Hollywood on Saturday as Pope Leo XIV hosted dozens of stars, including Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee and Monica Bellucci for a special audience celebrating the power of cinema.",
      "The event, organized by the Vatican's culture ministry, took place in a frescoed Vatican audience hall. Leo called on the attending artists to use their art to include marginalized voices and praised film to console and challenge audiences.",
      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",
      "\"His speech was beautiful and very inspiring, about hope and our work in cinema. We're glad we came,\" said Judd Apatow, who attended the audience with his wife and fellow Hollywood star Leslie Mann.",
      "\"It was so inspiring,\" Mann added.",
      "Leo spent nearly an hour greeting guests and making conversation with each attendee. Lee, a basketball lover, gifted the pontiff a New York Knicks jersey that featured the No. 14 and Leo's name on the back. Leo may be a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks' current roster includes three players from Villanova University, the Holy Father's alma mater. Lee said Leo's words about film were \"very, very moving.\"",
      "Pope Francis held similar audiences with artists and comedians. The audiences are part of the Vatican's efforts to reach out beyond the Catholic Church to engage with the secular world.",
      "A pope who \"grew up with cinema\"",
      "Leo is the first American-born Pope and grew up during Hollywood's heyday. Earlier this week, he listed his four favorite movies: \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"The Sound of Music,\" \"Ordinary People,\" and \"Life Is Beautiful,\" all classics that celebrate love and hope in the face of darkness. Leo will also be the subject of his own movie, a documentary from the Vatican that traces his life from Chicago to St. Peter's.",
      "\"He is a pope who grew up with television and grew up with cinema, and it's a natural (medium) to tell his story,\" said Monsignor Paul Tighe, the Vatican's culture secretary, in a conversation with CBS Saturday Morning.",
      "Tighe said the large group of filmmakers and actors was pulled together during the last three months. Vatican officials used contacts in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, to help craft the list of attendees. The hardest part, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation wasn't a hoax. Tighe told CBS Saturday Morning that he hopes the event shows that the Church embraces the arts, instead of just tolerating them.",
      "\"We have to trust that the artist, even when he or she is being provocative, is trying to wake us up, grab our attention, and make us think about things that are important,\" Tighe said.",

    "story": [
      "Like many of her Democratic colleagues, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is urging Congress to act quickly to address the spiraling cost of health care for millions of Americans who could soon see huge spikes in their insurance premiums.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview Friday. \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",
      "About 22 million lower- and middle-income Americans rely on the tax credits to reduce their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. During the longest government shutdown in history, Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but the shutdown ultimately ended Wednesday without a deal to extend the tax credits. Democrats were promised, however, that a vote on the tax credits will be held next month.",
      "But House Democrats took notice of Greene's views on health care. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he had found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse, replied,\"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "And top Republicans noticed, too. Earlier this week, President Trump said of Greene after she criticized him for focusing on foreign policy, rather than high prices at home, \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "\"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone.\" But she added that the rapidly rising health insurance costs had affected her personally.",
      "\"As far as health insurance is concern it hurt my own family. Back in 2010, the Democrats passed Obamacare, and in 2014 when it went into effect my family's health insurance went from $800 to over $2,400 a month, and we've seen the health insurance industry prices just go up and up,\" Greene said.",
      "\"I see simply that the American people have been done wrong, and I want my party to produce a solution and a plan that fixes this mess once and for all,\" Greene said. \"And so that is what I've been urging here in Washington, and I really hope to see Republicans and Democrats both work together to come up with a very good solution with health care for the American people.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 05:00:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Government documents show that federal regulators rarely warn plans that their networks of health providers are so skimpy they violate legal requirements.",
    "story": [
      "Along with the occasional aches and pains, growing older can bring surprise setbacks and serious diseases. Longtime relationships with doctors people trust often make even bad news more tolerable. Losing that support \u2014 especially during a health crisis \u2014 can be terrifying. That's why little-known federal requirements are supposed to protect people with privately run Medicare Advantage coverage when contract disputes lead their health care providers and insurers to part ways.",
      "But government documents obtained by KFF Health News show the agency overseeing Medicare Advantage does little to enforce long-standing rules intended to ensure about 35 million plan members can see doctors in the first place.",
      "In response to a Freedom of Information Act request covering the past decade, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services produced letters it sent to only five insurers from 2016 to 2022 after seven of their plans failed to meet provider network adequacy requirements \u2014 lapses that could, in some cases, harm patient care.",
      "Agency officials said some plans lacked enough primary care clinicians, specialists, or hospitals, according to the letters. And they warned that failure to meet the requirements could result in a freeze on marketing and enrollment, fines, or closure of the plan.",
      "CMS declined to detail why it found so few plans with network violations over the 10 years. \"The number of identified violations reflects the outcomes of targeted reviews, not a comprehensive audit of all plans in all years,\" said Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson.",
      "Officials in states with Advantage network violations say CMS didn't notify them, including directors of the government-funded State Health Insurance Assistance Program, which helps people navigate Medicare.",
      "\"It's hard for me to believe that only seven Medicare Advantage plans violated network rules,\" said David Lipschutz, a co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group. \"We often hear from folks \u2014 particularly in more rural areas \u2014 who have to travel significant distances in order to find contracted providers.\"",
      "Medicare Advantage is an increasingly popular alternative to the government-run Medicare program, which covers adults 65 and older and some people with disabilities. Of the 63 million Americans who were eligible to join Advantage plans instead of traditional Medicare, 54% did so for this year. The plans usually offer lower out-of-pocket costs and extra benefits, like coverage for vision, dental, and hearing care, but typically require their members to stick to select networks of doctors, hospitals, and other providers. Last year, the federal government paid Advantage plans an estimated $494 billion to care for patients.",
      "Traditional Medicare, by comparison, has no network and is accepted by nearly all doctors and hospitals in the nation.",
      "Conflicts between Medicare Advantage plans and the doctors, hospitals, and other providers that serve their members are common. Just this year, at least 38 hospital systems serving all or parts of 23 states have cut ties with at least 11 Advantage plans after failing to agree on payment and other issues, according to a review of news releases and press reports. Over the past three years, separations between Advantage plans and health systems have increased 66%, said FTI Consulting, which tracks reports of the disputes.",
      "After March, Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are generally locked into their plans for the year until the annual open enrollment period happening now through Dec. 7, for coverage beginning Jan. 1. But hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, and other health providers can leave plans anytime.",
      "When providers and insurers separate, Advantage members can lose access to longtime doctors or preferred hospitals in the middle of the year. In response, CMS sometimes gives Advantage customers a little-known escape hatch called a \"special enrollment period\" to change plans or enroll in traditional Medicare midyear.",
      "How CMS decides who gets an SEP is a mystery even to well-versed state insurance regulators and U.S. senators who oversee federal health programs. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) cited previous KFF Health News reporting on Medicare Advantage in an Oct. 30 letter asking CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz for an explanation.",
      "\"Despite the serious impacts of SEPs on enrollees and the market, the process of SEP determinations is opaque, leaving enrollees and state regulators in the dark,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Seniors deserve to know their Medicare plan isn't going to pull the rug out from under them halfway through the year,\" Wyden told KFF Health News.",
      "\"Help us\"",
      "Oz spoke to Medicare Advantage insurers Oct. 15 at a conference organized by the Better Medicare Alliance, a trade group, and encouraged them to help CMS police fraud in the program.",
      "\"Be our early-warning system,\" he told them. \"Tell us about problems you're witnessing. Help us figure out better ways of addressing it.\"",
      "When he finished speaking, he took a seat in the audience next to the president and chief executive of the group, Mary Beth Donahue, and smiled for photos.",
      "In six letters KFF Health News obtained, CMS officials told five insurers that their network adequacy violations could affect Advantage members' access to care. Five letters listed the number or types of medical specialists or facilities missing from the networks. In three cases, CMS noted that plans could request exceptions to the rules but didn't. In one letter, CMS requested the plan allow members to receive out-of-network care at no additional cost. Four letters required specific steps to address deficiencies, including submitting evidence that more clinicians were added to networks.",
      "Three letters required a \"corrective action plan,\" set deadlines for fixing problems, and warned that failure to comply with the rules could result in enrollment and marketing suspensions, fines, or forced plan closure. The other three letters were a \"notice of non-compliance,\" which urged insurers to comply with legal requirements.",
      "Although CMS regards the letters as the first step in its enforcement process, the agency did not provide information about whether these violations were resolved or if they resulted in penalties.",
      "The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a group created by Congress to monitor the program, said in a June 2024 report that \"CMS has the authority to impose intermediate sanctions or civil monetary penalties for noncompliance with network adequacy standards, but it has never done so.\"",
      "One of the network adequacy violation letters went to Vitality Health Plan of California in November 2020. That came after five hospitals and 13 nursing homes in one county and four hospitals in another all left the insurer's network, according to the letter from Timothy Roe, then-director of CMS' Division of Compliance, Surveillance, and Marketing. Two months before sending its letter, CMS granted Vitality plan members a special enrollment period.",
      "Beneficiaries welcomed the opportunity, said Marcelo Espiritu, program manager of the Santa Clara County office of California's Health Insurance Counseling & Advocacy Program. But Espiritu didn't know at the time that Vitality's depleted network violated CMS requirements, which Roe said put \"the health of Vitality's beneficiaries at risk.\"",
      "\"By not having enough network providers, beneficiaries may not be able to receive necessary services timely, or at all,\" Roe wrote.",
      "That's information patients need to know, Espiritu said.",
      "\"People would not be able to receive promised benefits and there would be delays in care and a lot of frustration in trying to find a new plan,\" he said. \"We would certainly warn people about the plan and remove it from our materials.\"",
      "Representatives from Commonwealth Care Alliance, which acquired Vitality in 2022, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Network minimums",
      "Federal law requires Medicare Advantage plans to include in their networks a minimum of 29 types of health care providers and 14 kinds of facilities that members can access within certain distances and travel times. The rules, which vary depending on a county's population and density, also limit how long patients should wait for appointments. The agency checks compliance every three years, or more often if it receives complaints.",
      "Networks can vary widely even within a county because the provider minimums apply to the insurer, not each plan it sells, according to a report from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. The company can offer the same network to members of multiple plans in one or more counties or create a separate network for each plan.",
      "In Arizona's Maricopa County, KFF researchers found, UnitedHealthcare offered 12 plans with 12 different networks in 2022. Depending on the plan, the company's customers had access to 37% to 61% of the physicians in the area available to traditional Medicare enrollees.",
      "In early 2016, CMS allowed 900 people in an Advantage plan in Illinois run by Harmony, then a WellCare subsidiary, to leave after the Christie Clinic, a large medical practice, left its provider network. The WellCare plan continued to operate without the clinic. But in June 2016, CMS told the plan in one of the letters KFF Health News obtained that losing the Christie Clinic meant the remaining provider network violated federal requirements.",
      "It was \"a significant network change with substantial enrollee impact,\" the letter said.",
      "Claudia Lennhoff, executive director at Champaign County Health Care Consumers, a government-funded Medicare counseling service that helped the WellCare members, said her group didn't know about the letter at the time.",
      "\"Not disclosing such information is a violation of trust,\" Lennhoff said. \"It could lead someone to make a decision that will be harmful to them, or that they will deeply regret.\"",
      "Centene Corp. bought WellCare in 2020, and representatives for the St. Louis-based company declined to comment on events that occurred before the acquisition.",
      "Two violation letters KFF Health News obtained from CMS went to Provider Partners Health Plan of Ohio in 2019 and 2022. The Ohio Department of Insurance was unaware of the violations, spokesperson Todd Walker said. He said CMS also did not notify the Ohio Senior Health Insurance Information Program, the state's free counseling service.",
      "Rick Grindrod, CEO and president of Provider Partners Health Plans, which is based in Maryland, said that after CMS reviewed its 2019 network, \"we proactively reduced our service area and deferred enrollment in the plan until 2021.\"",
      "But Grindrod said the plan enrolled only a small number of members in one county in 2021 and decided to withdraw from the Ohio market entirely at the end of that year.",
      "After Provider Partners withdrew from Ohio, CMS sent it another letter in March 2022 saying its network in 2021 had gaps in four counties for four types of providers and facilities. CMS asked the plan to comply with network rules by adding more providers.",
      "\"We believe CMS' network adequacy standards are generally clear and appropriate for ensuring beneficiary access,\" Grindrod said. \"While the standards are not difficult to understand, as a provider-sponsored plan with a small footprint, we sometimes face challenges securing contracts with large systems that prioritize larger Medicare Advantage plans.\"",
      "In 2021, CMS also sent a violation letter to North Carolina's Liberty Advantage. CMS didn't tell the state's free counseling service, the Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program, about the letter, said its director, Melinda Munden.",
      "Liberty representatives did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "CMS sent a letter in 2016 to CareSource about network deficiencies in some of its Medicare Advantage plans sold in Kentucky and Indiana. The agency asked the company to fix the problems, including by reimbursing any members billed for services from doctors who were not in the plans' networks.",
      "\"In response to the 2016 violations, we promptly implemented a Corrective Action Plan, which included a thorough review of our provider network to ensure adequacy standards were met,\" said Vicki McDonald, a CareSource spokesperson. \"CMS approved our plan, and no further action was required.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

    "story": [
      "Nvidia's third-quarter financial results on Wednesday surpassed analyst expectations, signaling that demand for its artificial intelligence chips remains robust amid investor concerns about an AI bubble.",
      "The chipmaker reported earnings of $31.9 billion on record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter. Revenue for the period surged 22% from the previous quarter and 62% from a year ago. Its earnings per share were $1.30. The Santa Clara, Calif., company had been expected to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $54.9 billion for the quarter, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "\"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday, referring to the company's proprietary superchips that power large language models.",
      "\"Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference \u2014 each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once,\" Huang added.",
      "Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The company's shares, which have jumped 39% this year, rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading to $193.80.",
      "\"This is a huge print and guidance from Nvidia that should reignite the bullish tech trade into year-end,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, adding that he thinks \"fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated.",
      "In October, the chipmaker became the first publicly listed company worth $5 trillion, with its shares buoyed by Wall Street expectations of surging demand.",
      "Rational exuberance?",
      "In recent weeks, some investors have expressed caution about the hype surrounding AI and whether the soaring market value of companies linked to the technology is warranted. Despite the promise of AI, most companies that are implementing AI have yet to see a measurable increase in productivity or profits, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Nvidia earnings are such an important event both because of the weighting that the stock has in the major equity indices and because it is ground zero for the entire Artificial Intelligence build out,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "The rapid construction of data centers across the U.S. has boosted demand for Nvidia's chips. Data center investment, which includes spending on AI research and development, has become the largest contributor to U.S. growth this year, according to S&P Global.",
      "The S&P 500's 15% gain this year has been driven largely by big tech companies with AI investments. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 accounts for 37% of the index's total value,\u00a0according\u00a0to Morningstar.",
      "\"Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure build out was a bubble, and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was, Zaccarelli said. \"But in the meantime, the largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable, and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real.\"",

      "Price increases are nowhere near the level reached in June of 2022, when the Consumer Price Index hit a 40-year high of 9.1%. Yet many people feel squeezed by the cost of simple daily necessities, including the ability to afford healthy food, and by long-term increases in the cost of essentials such as housing and health care.",
      "This affordability crisis is rooted in a combination of both longstanding economic issues dating back decades and more recent developments. For instance, housing costs have surged partly due to a lack of available homes, a result of cutbacks in construction following the Great Recession, while more recently steep new U.S. tariffs have fueled inflation.",
      "Inflation and the economy now rank as Americans' top national concerns, according to an October CBS News poll.",
      "\"Everything is going up in price very quickly,\" said Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Lawrence, Kansas.",
      "With his family's monthly health care premiums set to rise 18% to $2,600 next year, he's planning to cut back in other areas. \"Our food budget is going to go down \u2014 we're not talking about eating beans and rice, but going from a comfortable middle-class lifestyle to eating how we did when we first got out of college,\" Tolbert said.",
      "Here are five key categories of spending that many Americans are struggling to afford.",
      "Food",
      "Almost half of Americans say it's harder to afford groceries today than it was a year ago, according to a September survey\u00a0by Axios and the Harris Poll. Only 19% said food prices are cheaper than a year earlier, with roughly a third seeing no change.",
      "Growth in food prices has eased considerably, although it is still rising, with the latest CPI report showing grocery prices rose 2.7% in September on an annual basis, a sharp contrast to the\u00a011.4% increase in 2022. Overall, however, food prices as of September were more than 18% higher than in January of 2022, according to the CBS News price tracker.",
      "Shoppers don't assess food costs the same way economists do. They focus on their day-to-day spending \u2014 which keeps climbing \u2014 and compare their out-of-pocket spending today with what they paid several years ago,\u00a0according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "In other words, people's experience of inflation and how they measure it in their daily lives may not mesh with official economic measures that paint a more optimistic picture.",
      "Meanwhile, other recent signals underscore the difficulty many Americans have simply putting food on the table. Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to data from Purdue University's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "In New York City, for example, 40% of local families can't afford their weekly food costs, according to new data from charitable organization Robin Hood and Columbia University.",
      "Housing",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "The data backs that up, with a homebuyer today needing to earn $121,400 a year to afford a typical home, meaning that their monthly costs would remain below 30% of their annual income, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The average American earns about $84,000 a year, highlighting the considerable gap between incomes and home prices.",
      "Several forces have pushed housing costs higher. The rate of home construction plunged after the 2008-09 financial crisis, leading to a shortfall in housing inventory. Meeting today's demand for housing would require building as many as 4 million additional homes beyond current construction levels, Goldman Sachs estimates.",
      "The low interest rates that prevailed during the pandemic, when homebuyers could secure mortgages below 3%, sparked a buying rush that sent prices soaring. Even with a slight cooling this year, homes are selling for about 25% above their 2019 levels, while mortgage rates have more than doubled since their pandemic lows.",
      "Child care",
      "The challenge of affording child care is another pain point for many families. In 2024, the average annual cost of care for one child around the U.S. topped $13,000, up 30% from 2020, according to Child Care Aware America, a nonprofit group.",
      "Families with a single child can end up paying between roughly 9% and 16% of their median income on full-time day care,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Labor. That means parents are often spending more on child care than they do on other expenses, such as groceries or even rent, data shows.",
      "Gina Monroe, a 42-year-old mom based in Massapequa, New York, said the financial strain of child care has made her and her husband think twice about having another child. She started sending her 2-year-old son to day care in September and pays around $450 a week.",
      "\"Nothing's getting any cheaper,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Child care costs have surged partly because there aren't enough early education workers to support the number of children who need care, according to experts. The industry also pays meager wages, adding to the challenges of recruiting new workers, said Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families.",
      "Health care",
      "Americans are also getting socked by rising health care costs, ranging from higher insurance premiums to out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-pays. The increase in medical costs stems largely from the emergence of more expensive treatments, such as the popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs, as well as an aging population that requires more care, according to consulting firm Mercer.",
      "The cost of health care was at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, with Democratic lawmakers pushing to extend a tax credit to defray the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The shutdown ended without an agreement to extend the subsidies, which means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums rise from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "Employees who get their insurance through employer-based plans are likely to see their health care costs rise as much as 7% for their 2026 plans, according to Mercer.",
      "Electricity and utility costs",
      "Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utility costs, up 12% since last year, according to a new\u00a0report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.",
      "The surge stems from a succession of rate hikes across the U.S, as electricity demand outstrips supply. In 2025 alone, more than 124 million Americans are expected to see some sort of rate increase in their energy bill, a recent PowerLines\u00a0report\u00a0found.",
      "Even if you do your best to shut off every light, some fixed costs are unavoidable, such as the so-called \"delivery charge,\" or what a utility charges to send electricity from a power plant to a home, said Rodrigues of the National Parents Union.",
      "The energy burden falls most acutely on low- and middle-income families, who spend between 6% and 10% of their income on energy, or three to five times that of higher-income households, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.",

      "Customers will be able to browse Target's selection and make purchases within the ChatGPT app, according to the retailer. The tool will debut next week, providing access to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly active users in time for the holiday shopping season.",
      "Target is leaning on price cuts and a $1 billion investment plan to revive its brand, the retailer said separately Wednesday, as same-store sales fell 2.7% in the latest quarter and profit tumbled 19%. With shoppers increasingly relying on AI to find products online, other big retailers \u2014 including Walmart, which struck a similar partnership with OpenAI last month \u2014 are turning to the technology to boost sales.",
      "Here's how the ChatGPT-powered Target tool will work: Inside the ChatGPT app, consumers can tag Target and ask for ideas, such as if they're planning something like a holiday family movie night. The Target app will then suggest specific products, such as blankets or snacks, and allow users to buy them directly without leaving the ChatGPT interface.",
      "Target said that AI will eventually start to understand and predict what customers want to buy.",
      "A recent Harris Poll\u00a0shows that nearly half of Gen Z consumers would trust AI as a personal shopper that helps them pick out what they buy and find deals. Streamlining the purchasing process could help retailers boost sales, according to retail experts.",

    "story": [
      "As child care costs soar, many Americans today find themselves paying more for a caregiver than they do for their monthly rent, according to a new analysis.",
      "Child care costs for parents with two kids exceed rental costs in 85 of the country's largest metro areas, personal finance site\u00a0LendingTree found. In Omaha, Neb., Milwaukee, Wis., and Buffalo, N.Y., which have the highest child care costs in the country relative to local rents, families with an infant and a 4-year-old under care on average pay more than double the cost of their rent.",
      "Families around the U.S. pay an average of $1,282 for full-time infant care, still below the average monthly cost to rent a two-bedroom unit, LendingTree's data shows. Families with two children, on the other hand, spend an average of $2,252 per month on child care.",
      "LendingTree, which determined how child care costs stack up against rent in 100 cities. compiled its findings using data from nonprofit group Child Care Aware of America and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Exorbitant child care costs are contributing to what amounts to a crisis of affordability for many Americans, who also face rising food, housing,\u00a0energy and\u00a0health care costs. A\u00a0survey\u00a0of roughly 3,000 people released this week by Brigham Young University and Deseret News found that 7 in 10 respondents said that raising children is unaffordable, a sentiment that has surged over the last decade.",
      "One parent facing a child care crunch is New York City resident Gina Monroe, who started sending her son to day care in September.",
      "\"Having to have a household with both parents working and a grandmother that was getting too old to take care of a two-year-old, you don't have a choice,\" she told CBS News.",
      "The 42-year-old said she pays $450 a week to send her son to a day care center on nearby Long Island. That's less than her monthly mortgage payment of $3,200, but still represents one of her family's biggest expenses, she said.",
      "The financial strain of everyday life in the U.S., especially following the fierce inflation that erupted during the pandemic, has emerged as a political flashpoint this year.",
      "For example, the Trump administration has in recent weeks floated several ideas aimed at easing costs for Americans, including proposals for a\u00a0$2,000 tariff rebate check\u00a0and a 50-year mortgage. The administration also last week\u00a0announced tariff exemptions on some popular grocery store staples, including bananas, beef and coffee, as Americans continue to battle elevated food costs.",
      "Incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also made issues around affordability the centerpiece of his campaign, urging city officials to establish free child care for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old.",
      "Why are child care costs soaring?",
      "Child care expenses have been rising steadily for years, and show little sign of relenting. From 2020 to 2024, costs rose nearly 30%, data from the nonprofit group Child Care Aware shows.",
      "The main driver for that surge, according to experts: a shortage of early education workers and available places at daycare centers, relative to the enormous demand for such services from families around the U.S.",
      "To that end, Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, pointed to what he described as \"child care deserts\" in some regions, where parents face a dearth of acceptable options. These are most common in low-income rural areas, which have difficulty recruiting and retaining a qualified workforce, a 2023 government report found.",
      "Where high-quality child care is in short supply, the owners can charge a premium given they face little competition, Schulz noted.",
      "Many households also don't have the benefit of having nearby family members who can help with child care responsibilities, Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families, told CBS News.",

The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",

    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",

      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market sank sharply in early trading, with investors increasingly skittish about the strength of the artificial intelligence boom.",
      "The S&P 500, which set a record high in late October, fell 78 points, or 1.2%, to 6,594 roughly an hour into Tuesday's session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively.",
      "The S&P 500 remains up more than 12% this year, the Dow has added 8% and the Nasdaq has risen more than 15%.",
      "AI pioneer Nvidia was again the heaviest weight on the market. The chipmaker's drop of 3.2% brought its loss for the month to nearly 11%, putting it in \"correction\" territory, or when a stock falls at least 10% from its previous high. The company is scheduled to report is third-quarter financial results on Wednesday.",
      "\"Stocks are extending their losses so far on [Tuesday] as sentiment stays downbeat and investors continue to dial back on tech exposure,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a research note.",
      "What Nvidia does matters disproportionately to investors because it's the most influential stock on Wall Street. It can almost single-handedly steer the direction of the S&P 500 on some days because of its immense size, after fervent demand for its AI chips helped it briefly top $5 trillion in total value. The S&P 500 sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts.",
      "\"The boost AI has given to the U.S. stock market since the launch of ChatGPT has been so strong that the S&P 500 would currently be closer to 5,000 without it,\" John Higgins, chief markets economist with Capital Economics, said in a note to investors. \"It's therefore hardly surprising that investors are preoccupied with whether the gains racked up by titans in the sectors at the heart of this transformative technology can be sustained.\"",
      "Nvidia's and the U.S. stock market's struggles are a sharp turnaround from months of relentless rallying since April, when Wall Street sold off after President Donald Trump shocked the world with stiff tariffs.",
      "That rally, though, was so strong that critics said it may have carried stock prices too high, too fast and left the market at risk of a sharp drop. They pointed in particular to stocks swept up in the mania around AI.",
      "Despite Wall Street's recent stumble, many big investors expect stocks to recover, according to the latest monthly survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Global Research. But when asked what the No. 1 risk for the market is, one with a lower probability of happening but a high chance of damage, 45% pointed to an AI bubble. That beat out trouble in the bond market, inflation and trade wars.",
      "The highest net percentage of investors in 20 years is also saying companies are \"overinvesting,\" according to the survey. The worry is that all the investment pouring into AI chips and data centers worldwide may not produce the kind of revolution that proponents have been predicting, or at least not as profitable a one.",
      "Other high-flying areas of the market with their own evangelists have also been struggling lately. Bitcoin's price briefly fell below $90,000 during the morning, down from nearly $125,000 last month.",
      "Elsewhere on Wall Street, Cloudflare fell 3.1% after an issue at the internet infrastructure provider caused global outages for ChatGPT and other services.",

    "story": [
      "Tokyo\u00a0\u2014 Japan said Monday that it had scrambled aircraft after detecting a suspected Chinese drone near its southern island of Yonaguni, which is close to Taiwan, on Saturday, as tension between the Asian adversaries spiked.",
      "On Sunday, Chinese coast guard vessels spent several hours in Japan's territorial waters around the disputed Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu in China and a frequent flashpoint, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said.",
      "The incidents came amid escalating tension between the neighbors over remarks by Japan's staunchly conservative new leader, who suggested Tokyo could intervene militarily in any hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan.",
      "Beijing insists Taiwan \u2014 which Japan occupied for decades until its 1945 defeat in World War II \u2014   is part of its territory, and the prime minister's comments have sparked outrage among Chinese officials.",
      "Japanese leader's controversial remarks about China and Taiwan",
      "Before taking power last month, Prime Minister Senae Takaichi, 64, was a vocal critic of China and its military build-up in the Asia-Pacific.",
      "If a Taiwan emergency entails \"battleships and the use of force, then that could constitute a situation threatening the survival (of Japan),\" she told parliament on Nov. 7. Under Japan's self-imposed domestic rules, an existential threat is one of the few cases where it can act militarily. Taiwan sits around 60 miles from the nearest Japanese island.",
      "In response to Takaichi's remarks, a Chinese diplomat stationed in Japan threatened to \"cut off that dirty neck,\" apparently referring to Takaichi, as China and Japan summoned each other's ambassadors.",
      "In Beijing, tech worker Daniel Feng called the Chinese government's responses \"very restrained\" given Takaichi's \"extremely unreasonable\" remarks.",
      "\"If she spouts words, that's not a problem ... but if they take real action, our country's military will definitely defeat them,\" the 40-year-old told AFP.",
      "Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te called on Beijing on Monday to \"show restraint, act like a major power, and not become the troublemaker\" in the Asia-Pacific region, where peace and stability have been \"severely impacted.\"",
      "\"China should return to the path of a rules-based international order, which would help maintain peace, stability and prosperity in the region,\" Lai told reporters.",
      "Beijing, meanwhile, said Chinese premier Li Qiang had no plans to meet with Takaichi at the G20 summit in South Africa later this week, which they are both set to attend.",
      "Economic impact as Asian economic giants feud",
      "Beijing also advised its citizens over the weekend to avoid traveling to Japan, and warned the roughly 100,000 Chinese students in the country that there were alleged risks to their safety.",
      "Cabinet chief Kihara told reporters on Monday that the announcements were \"incompatible with the broader direction agreed upon by the leaders of the two nations.\"",
      "Japanese tourism and retail shares dived on Monday after China urged its citizens to avoid the neighboring nation's tourist hotspots.",
      "Asia's two top economies are closely entwined, with China the biggest source of tourists \u2014   almost 7.5 million visitors in the first nine months of 2025 \u2014   coming to Japan.",
      "Drawn by a weak yen making shopping cheaper, they collectively splurged more than a billion dollars a month in the third quarter, accounting for almost 30% of all tourist spending.",
      "Japan was also the fourth-most popular destination for Chinese tourists last year, helping the land of Mount Fuji, sushi and geishas set new records for foreign arrivals. But in fears that this may now stop, investors wiped 9% off Japanese cosmetics firm Shiseido's market value on Monday.",
      "Department store group Mitsukoshi fell 11.3% and Pan Pacific, behind discount retail chain and tourist magnet Don Quijote, slid 5.3%.",
      "Japan Airlines, whose shares nosedived 3.4%, has not seen any major cancellations on flights to and from China, a spokesperson told AFP.",
      "CBS News foreign correspondent Anna Coren reports that, apart from tourism there are concerns in Japan that China could inflict more economic pain by weaponizing its dominance in the supply chains of rare earth and other critical minerals, both of which are vital to Japan's electronics and automotive industries.",
      "Even Japan's film industry has been affected. Two movies due for release in China have been suspended.",
      "No off-ramp in sight for China and Japan's feud",
      "In response to the fallout, Coren said Japan on Tuesday urged its citizens in China to take precautions, including avoiding crowds and watching for suspicious people. Last year, a Japanese schoolboy was fatally stabbed in southern China.",
      "The tit-for-tat warnings from both capitals have fueled concern about nationalism being whipped up, and Coren said there was no apparent off-ramp available to ease tension. Japan sent a senior diplomat to Beijing for talks on Tuesday, but there was no announcement of any significant progress to ease the bilateral standoff.",
      "During the daily briefing on Tuesday at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesman demanded that Japan \"immediately retract its erroneous remarks, engage in profound self-reflection, change course, and provide the Chinese people with a clear explanation\" of Takaichi's comments.",
      "In Tokyo, the government maintains that the new prime minister's remarks did not represent any departure from previous policy.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:18:14 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Nov. 9 said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a\u00a0Truth Social post last week. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later\u00a0told Fox News that the rebates would likely be given to families making \"less than, say, $100,000.\"\u00a0 That threshold is still in discussion, he added.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "Speaking from the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said his administration plans on issuing dividends from tariffs \"probably in the middle of next year.\"\u00a0He said \"thousands of dollars\" would go to \"moderate income, middle income\" Americans, adding that his administration has taken in \"tremendous amounts of money\" from tariffs.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "Bessent on Nov. 9 told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending new tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:27:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age is changing next year, affecting when the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers can collect 100% of their benefits.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security's so-called \"full retirement age\" \u2014 the age when people can start collecting all of their earned benefits \u2014 is about to hit a new threshold, a change that will affect Americans born in 1960 or later.",
      "The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security is calculated using a worker's birth year, while their monthly benefits are based on the number of years they've worked and their income over that period. People may claim Social Security as early as age 62, but doing so permanently reduces their monthly benefit by about 30% compared with waiting until hitting their FRA.",
      "Starting in 2026, Social Security's full retirement age is set to make its final scheduled increase, marking the last step-up in age enacted under a\u00a01983 congressional reform\u00a0designed to shore up the program's finances. Before that overhaul, people could claim their FRA benefits at 65, but the law gradually pushed that age higher, culminating in the change that takes effect in 2026.",
      "Since 2021, the FRA has been rising by two months each year. It now stands at 66 years and 10 months for people born in 1959. Next year brings the final step in that schedule, when the FRA will reach 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later.",
      "With the FRA hitting 67, people born in 1960 won't qualify for their full benefits until 2027, rather than 2026. (You can check your own full-benefit age by entering your birthdate into this Social Security calculator.)",
      "The increase in the FRA will first impact the youngest baby boomers, or those born between 1960-1964, followed by Generation X, which spans 1965 to 1980. The change comes as many workers report feeling financially unprepared for retirement, with only about four in 10 Americans saying they're on track to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement,\u00a0according\u00a0to recent research from Vanguard.",
      "\"Raising the retirement age is an effective cut in lifetime benefits for younger baby boomers, members of Gen X and all the generations after,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the advocacy group National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, in an email to CBS News.",
      "While the increase in the full retirement age shouldn't come as a surprise given it was enacted 43 years ago, it doesn't guarantee older workers will be any more prepared financially for retirement, he added.",
      "\"Having time to plan, however, does not mean they have been able to put aside more for retirement, considering the stagnation of real wages and the rising cost of college tuition, home prices and other key living expenses,\" Richtman said.",
      "Retirement expectations versus reality",
      "There's also a longstanding gap between the age at which people expect to stop working and their real-world experiences, which can add to the financial strain of funding retirement. Many Americans believe they'll retire at age 65, but the median retirement age in the U.S. is in fact 62.",
      "Nearly six in 10 retirees say they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned, according to research published last year by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. An October survey from the same group found that most middle-class retirees \u2014 people with annual household incomes between $50,000 and $199,999 \u2014 stopped working earlier than they envisioned because of employment issues, such as losing their jobs, or poor health.",
      "That gap between expectations and reality may explain recent research that found 44% of Americans said they plan to claim Social Security before they\u00a0reach their full retirement age, which would result in lower monthly benefits.",
      "Some Americans also flle for Social Security before reaching their FRA out of a belief it makes more sense to bank more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower monthly amount.",
      "Transamerica also found that nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore the conventional financial advice of\u00a0waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which locks in a 24% boost to a retiree's FRA payments.",
      "In the meantime, younger boomers and Gen Xers will have to hold off a little longer to claim their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"These younger cohorts will have to try their best to plan for retirement, knowing that they cannot collect full benefits until 67,\" Richtman added.",

The tools will help compare prices at different stores, and can even offer step-by-step instructions on how to prepare a Thanksgiving meal, as well as outline different recipes for various dishes.",
      "For example, Microsoft Co-Pilot lets users take photos of specific products and then ask questions about the product, like \"where can I find the best deal on this boxed stuffing?\" or \"how many boxes of this stuffing will I need to feed 10 people?\" The chatbot will offer suggestions based on those prompts, help shoppers buy the appropriate amount of ingredients and stay on budget by pointing to any cheaper options at local stores.",
      "Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst who goes by \"The SupermarketGuru,\" said smart shoppers can feed guests this holiday season for under $6 a person.",
      "AI is one tool consumers can use to ensure they're getting the best deals and to keep their holiday budgets under control. This year, shoppers can expect to spend roughly $80 to $95 \u2014 or $8 to $9.50 per person \u2014 preparing Thanksgiving dinner, according to a recent Wells Fargo analysis.",
      "That's about 2% to 3% less this year compared with Turkey Day costs in 2024, the bank found. Consumers are catching a break on foods such as bread, butter, eggs and wine, while the cost of staples such as potatoes, milk and some vegetables has remained flat or risen only modestly, according to the CBS News price tracker.",
      "As for the star ingredient, turkey, wholesale prices have jumped about 40% since last year, from 94 cents a pound to $1.32, according to the Department of Agriculture. However, wholesale costs don't always mean higher store prices. Wells Fargo found that retail prices for turkey are down 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Retailers are also making it easier for shoppers to save money and time by offering budget-friendly Thanksgiving dinner packages. Target offers a dinner option that serves four people for $20, while Amazon provides a similar package that feeds five for $25. Each bundle includes a turkey, along with ingredients for classic sides such as stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy and bread.",
      "For larger gatherings, Walmart and ALDI also have $40 meal baskets designed to serve up to 10 people.",
      "Tech can also help consumers find the best deals at supermarkets in their area. The Flipp app compiles digital ads from more than a thousand retailers and lets users browse weekly flyers, compare prices across stores and create shopping lists.",

    "story": [
      "A growing share of lower-income Americans are struggling to get by financially as their wages fail to keep up with inflation, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Roughly 29% of lower-income households are living paycheck to paycheck, up slightly from 2024 and from 27.1% in 2023, data from the Bank of America Institute shows. The financial firm defines that as spending more than 95% of household income on necessities such as housing, gasoline, groceries, utility bills and internet service.",
      "In 2025, nearly a quarter of all U.S. households lived paycheck to paycheck, Bank of America estimates. Several factors explain why many people are falling behind.",
      "First, the nation's inflation rate this year has edged up to an annual rate of 3%\u00a0after dipping to 2.3% in April. The rise in consumer prices this year is well below their pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in 2022, but remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%.",
      "\"Inflation is picking back up again, and cost increases are picking back up again,\" said Joe Wadford, an economist at the Bank of America Institute, which recently\u00a0examined\u00a0the financial pressures facing Americans by income. \"That's definitely going to put some renewed pressure on those households.\"",
      "Second, the cost of groceries and other essentials is continuing to rise as lower-wage workers see their paychecks and purchasing power stagnate. In October, wages for lower-income households were up only 1% from a year ago, according to Bank of America deposit data.",
      "\"The gap between their wages and expenses has just continued to widen since the beginning of the year,\" Wadford said. \"When the cost of living is increasing 3% but your wages are only increasing 1%, you're just going to really struggle to keep up.\"",
      "Lower-wage workers experienced strong wage growth during the pandemic and subsequent economic recovery, but that rise has slowed sharply since late 2022, according to Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. One factor weighing on wage growth \u2014 a decline in job openings and the rate at which workers are leaving their jobs.",
      "\"When people aren't looking for other offers or quitting, that is going to cause wage growth to slow,\" she said.",
      "In the trailing 12 months through October, higher-income millennial households have seen their average wages grow five percentage points faster than those of lower-income millennials, according to the Bank of America Institute.",
      "While lower-income households are struggling to scrape by, middle- and higher-income households are on firmer financial footing, buoyed by stronger wage growth. This group has seen little to no increase in the share of households living paycheck to paycheck, the Bank of America Institute found.",
      "\"These higher-income cohorts are more able to absorb the recent reacceleration in inflation due to their outsized wage growth,\" Wadford wrote in the report.",
      "That bifurcation is fueling what economists refer to as the \"K-shaped economy,\" a term experts use to describe the divergence in spending and financial health between wealthier Americans and people with more modest incomes.",
      "Gould also noted that many low-income Americans are unbanked and that Bank of America's findings, which are drawn from an analysis of its depositor data, may not fully capture the impact of slowing wage growth on poor households.",
      "\"You're missing some of the bottom end and how much pain [and] economic distress they may be feeling,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Wendy's plans to close hundreds of U.S. restaurants in the coming months as revenue and profits decline, with the company citing cutbacks by lower-income consumers that it expects will persist through year's end.",
      "On a Friday investor call, Ken Cook, Wendy's interim CEO, didn't disclose the exact number or locations of restaurants that it plans to shutter. But he said the Dublin, Ohio-based company is likely to close in the \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its 6,011 U.S locations, or roughly 300 store closures if it shuts 5% of its existing restaurants.",
      "Wendy's said the closures will start in the fourth quarter this year. Closing underperforming locations will improve traffic and profitability at its remaining U.S. restaurants, Cook added.",
      "Fast-food chains have been struggling to lift sales as lower-income consumers feel increasingly squeezed by rising food costs. Both Wendy's and McDonald's have introduced value meals to entice diners, but Cook said he doesn't expect the financial strain on these households to ease soon.",
      "\"We do see more pressure on the lower-income consumer,\" he said Friday. \"We continued to see that in [the third quarter] and we expect that to continue into the fourth.\"",
      "The new round of closures comes on top of the closure of 140 U.S. Wendy's locations in 2024. At the time, Wendy's said that many of the 55-year-old chain's restaurants are simply out of date.",
      "Cook became Wendy's CEO in July after the company's previous CEO, Kirk Tanner, left to become the president and CEO of Hershey Co.",
      "Cook said in some cases, Wendy's will make improvements to struggling stores, including adding technology or equipment. In other cases, it will transfer ownership to a different operator or close the restaurant altogether.",
      "\"When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective. The goal is to address and fix those restaurants,\" Cook said during a conference call with investors.",
      "In the first nine months of this year, Wendy's said its U.S. same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 4% compared to the same period last year. Wendy's revenue fell 2% to $1.63 billion in the same period, while its net income fell 6% to $138.6 million.",
      "Cook said $5 and $8 meal deals \u2014 which have been matched by McDonald's \u2014 have helped bring some traffic back to its U.S. stores. But Wendy's isn't doing a good job of bringing in new customers, Cook said, so the company plans to shift its marketing to emphasize its value and the freshness of its ingredients.",

      "The flight cuts started at 4% and later grew to 6% before the FAA on Friday rolled the restrictions back to 3%, citing continued improvements in air traffic controller staffing since the record 43-day shutdown ended on Nov. 12.",
      "The number of flights canceled this weekend was at its lowest point since the order took effect and was well below the 3% cuts FAA was requiring for Saturday and Sunday. Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium showed that less than 1% of all flights were canceled this weekend. The flight tracking website FlightAware said 149 flights were cut Sunday and 315 were canceled on Saturday.",
      "The FAA statement said an agency safety team recommended the order be rescinded after \"detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events in air traffic control facilities.\"",
      "The statement said the FAA \"is aware of reports of non-compliance by carriers over the course of the emergency order. The agency is reviewing and assessing enforcement options.\" It did not elaborate.",
      "Cancellations hit their highest point Nov. 9, when airlines cut more than 2,900 flights because of the FAA order, ongoing controller shortages and severe weather in parts of the country. Conditions began to improve throughout last week as more controllers returned to work amid news that Congress was close to a deal to end the shutdown. That progress also prompted the FAA to pause plans for further rate increases.",
      "The agency had initially aimed for a 10% reduction in flights. Duffy had said worrisome safety data showed the move was necessary to ease pressure on the aviation system and help manage worsening staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities as the shutdown entered its second month and flight disruptions began to pile up.",
      "Air traffic controllers were among the federal employees who had to continue working without pay throughout the shutdown. They missed two paychecks during the impasse.",
      "Duffy hasn't shared the specific safety data that prompted the cuts, but he cited reports during the shutdown of planes getting too close in the air, more runway incursions and pilot concerns about controllers' responses.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 06:21:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed changes include the elimination of the \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's administration moved Wednesday to roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live, reviving a suite of changes to Endangered Species Act regulations from the Republican's first term that were blocked under former Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "The proposed changes include the elimination of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened. Government agencies instead would have to craft species-specific rules for protections, a potentially lengthy process.",
      "The administration's announcement answers longstanding calls for revisions to the Endangered Species Act from Republicans in Congress and industries including oil and gas, mining and agriculture. The president has voiced frustration with the\u00a01973 law\u00a0and similar environmental protections, saying environmentalists are impeding growth. Critics argue the landmark 1973 environmental law has been wielded too broadly, to the detriment of economic growth.",
      "But environmentalists warned the changes could cause yearslong delays in efforts to save species such as the\u00a0monarch butterfly, Florida\u00a0manatee, California spotted owl\u00a0and North American wolverine.",
      "Scientists and government agencies say extinctions are accelerating globally because of habitat loss and other pressures.",
      "Trump has made oil and gas production a centerpiece of his presidency and sought to strip away environmental regulations that impede development. Other pending proposals from the administration would revise the definition of \"harm\"\u00a0under the Endangered Species Act and potentially bypass species protections for logging projects in national forests and on public lands.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement that the administration was restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent while respecting \"the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources.\"",
      "\"These revisions end years of legal confusion and regulatory overreach, delivering certainty to states, tribes, landowners and businesses while ensuring conservation efforts remain grounded in sound science and common sense,\" Burgum said in a statement.",
      "Another proposed change tasks officials with analyzing economic impacts when deciding whether habitat is critical to a species' survival.",
      "In April, a White House official confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump planned to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in the U.S. where endangered species live. The president\u00a0directed\u00a0agencies regulating energy and the environment to sunset a number of environmental protections, among other steps to curb environmental protections to spur construction and economic growth.",
      "Case of lizard shows potential outcome of proposals",
      "The case of the Yarrow's spiny lizard in the Southwest exemplifies the potential consequences of the proposals. Rapidly warming temperatures have ravaged a population of the lizard in Arizona's Mule Mountains, pushing the reptiles further up the mountainsides toward the highest peaks and possibly toward extinction.",
      "A petition filed Wednesday seeks protections for the lizard and the designation of critical habitat. Advocates say analyzing the economic impacts could delay protections. Designating critical habitat could be another hurdle because the primary threat to this population of spiny lizard is climate change.",
      "\"We think that the species should be listed as endangered. In fact, we are somewhat shocked that it is not already extinct,\" said John Wiens, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, who co-authored the petition.",
      "The Interior Department was sued over the blanket protection rule in March, by the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) and Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. The two groups argued the rule was illegal and discouraged states and landowners from assisting in species recovery efforts.",
      "Species designated as \"threatened\" under the rule automatically qualify for the same protections as those with the more severe designation of \"endangered.\"",
      "PERC Vice President Jonathan Wood said Wednesday's proposal was a \"necessary course correction.\"",
      "\"This reform acknowledges the blanket rule's unlawfulness and puts recovery back at the heart of the Endangered Species Act,\" Wood said.",
      "Proposals would undermine protections, critic says",
      "Kristen Boyles with the environmental law firm Earthjustice said the changes undermine protections even more than in Trump's first term. That includes allowing the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to not count negative effects on species if those impacts are not regulated by the agencies themselves, Boyles said.",
      "\"The Services are required to prevent harmful consequences to species, not ignore them,\" she said.",
      "Trump officials during his first term also rolled back protections for individual species including the northern spotted owl and gray wolf.",
      "The spotted owl decision was reversed in 2021 after officials said Trump's political appointees used faulty science to justify opening millions of acres of West Coast forest to potential logging. Protections for wolves across most of the U.S. were restored by a federal court in 2022.",
      "The Endangered Species Act protects more than 1,600 species in the United States and its territories. In the more than 50 years since the law was enacted, the\u00a0act has been credited with saving 99% of the listed species. Notable species saved include the bald eagle, American alligators, whooping cranes and peregrine falcons.",
      "CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2023 that since the passage of the law, more than 1,7000 plants, mammals, fish, insects and other species in the U.S. have been listed as threatened or endangered. But federal data shows that of the roughly $1.2 billion a year spent on endangered and threatened species, about half goes toward recovery of just two types of fish:\u00a0salmon\u00a0and steelhead trout along the West Coast.",
      "Last month, an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature said that arctic seals\u00a0are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of\u00a0bird species\u00a0around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion. One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said as it released its latest\u00a0Red List of Threatened Species.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is pushing to remove Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year.",
    "story": [
      "A top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is set to testify Thursday about the steps the Trump administration has taken to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the West African country of Liberia, as the Trump administration continues its push to remove him from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration urged U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to lift an August order that prevents Abrego Garcia from being deported to a third-party country without due process, arguing that the government has gone through all the necessary steps to remove Abrego Garcia.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has been a flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown since the Salvadoran immigrant was removed from where he lived in Maryland to his native country in March. He was sent to El Salvador even though in 2019, an immigration judge granted him a legal status known as withholding of removal because of concerns Abrego Garcia\u00a0 could be persecuted by gangs there.",
      "He faces deportation proceedings because he entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2011.",
      "In June, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. after he was detained in El Salvador's notorious mega-prison to face two felony charges of human smuggling. He has denied those charges.",
      "Before Abrego Garcia's criminal trial is scheduled to begin next year, the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. again, proposing to send him to several African countries, including Uganda, Eswatini and now, Liberia.",
      "The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, was interviewed in October by a U.S. government asylum officer, and that officer determined that he failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia. The Justice Department said any additional due process steps would be unwarranted.",
      "Abrego Garcia's \"claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event,\" the Justice Department said in its filing. \"This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia.\"",
      "In addition, the Justice Department submitted declarations from U.S. officials stating that Liberia has made \"sufficient and credible\" assurances that Abrego Garcia would not be harmed there or removed from Liberia to another country where he potentially could be persecuted.",
      "In a press release late last month, Liberia's government said it had agreed to receive Abrego Garcia on \"a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis,\" following a U.S. request.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his legal team have repeatedly challenged the government's attempts to deport him to African nations, claiming fear of persecution or torture. They have also argued that the Trump administration's repeated efforts to send Abrego Garcia to Africa is a form of retaliation, and Abrego Garcia should instead be sent to Costa Rica.",
      "They noted the government had offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica this summer, but only if he pleaded guilty to the federal human smuggling charges he faces in Tennessee.",
      "\"The timeline suggests a pattern: when the Government received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's civil case challenging his unlawful removal to El Salvador; it initiated a criminal prosecution in retaliation; and when it received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's criminal case, it initiated third-country removal efforts in retaliation,\" the attorneys said in a response to the Justice Department's motion.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have also asked Xinis to keep her block on his deportation in place \"unless and until an immigration judge concurs\" with the Trump administration's determinations.",

The defendants in the case allegedly \"conspired to steal\" the money by sending it through multiple accounts.",

I am deeply grateful for the support of my district, and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I look forward to my day in court.

    "summary": "A federal judge penned a heated dissent after this week's ruling that blocked Texas' redistricting effort, accusing the judge who wrote the majority opinion of \"outrageous conduct\" and \"cherry-picking of the highest order.\"",
    "story": [
      "One day after a Trump-appointed federal judge helped toss out Texas' redistricting effort, a Reagan-appointed judge penned a heated and invective-filled dissent accusing his fellow jurist of \"cherry-picking of the highest order.\"",
      "A three-judge panel ruled 2-1 on Tuesday that Texas must set aside the new congressional maps that it drew earlier this year, with Judge Jeffrey Brown writing for the majority that the map \u2014 which would create five new GOP-friendly House seats \u2014 was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling was issued by Brown and Judge David Guaderrama, nominated to the bench by President Trump and former President Barack Obama, respectively. The state of Texas quickly\u00a0appealed the ruling\u00a0to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The ruling could upend this year's nationwide redistricting gambit. Multiple states have followed Texas' lead and redrawn their maps, including California, which made five congressional districts more friendly to Democrats in response.",
      "The panel's third member, Judge Jerry Smith, filed his response on Wednesday, writing the phrase \"I dissent\" some 16 times over the course of his 104-page opinion.",
      "Smith, nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan in 1987, accused the two other judges of issuing the ruling without giving him enough time to respond, which he called an \"outrage.\" He wrote that in the days prior to the ruling, Brown sent him a pair of drafts that were more than 160 pages long, only offered a few days to react, and didn't wait for Smith to write his dissent.",
      "\"In my 37 years on the federal bench, this is the most outrageous conduct by a judge that I have ever encountered in a case in which I have been involved,\" Smith wrote.",
      "The dissent \u2014 which started by warning readers, \"Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night!\" \u2014 also attacked the opinion itself in often-harsh terms. He called Brown an \"unskilled magician,\" compared his reasoning to a \"bizarre multiple-choice question from hell,\" and called the ruling the \"most blatant exercise of judicial activism that I have ever witnessed.\"",
      "At one point, when discussing the court's decision to grant a preliminary injunction, Smith writes: \"If this were a law school exam, the opinion would deserve an 'F.'\"",
      "Race or politics?",
      "At the heart of Smith and Brown's disagreement is whether Texas lawmakers redrew the state's House districts for partisan reasons or racial reasons.",
      "The map-drawing effort began after Mr. Trump and his allies pushed Texas officials over the summer to create as many as five new GOP-leaning seats, as Republicans fight to hold onto a razor-thin House majority in next year's midterms.",
      "At one point during that gambit, Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, sent Texas Gov. Greg Abbott a letter alleging that a handful of the state's existing districts were illegal \"coalition\" districts where non-Hispanic White voters are in the minority but no single racial group has a majority.",
      "Tuesday's majority opinion, penned by Brown, said that Abbott \"explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race\" and \"repeatedly stated that his goal was to eliminate coalition districts and create new majority-Hispanic districts.\"",
      "The court concluded that the state's redistricting effort was unconstitutional because it was driven by racial considerations, not pure politics. It's legal for lawmakers to redraw maps for partisan reasons, Brown wrote, but racially gerrymandered maps can be challenged in court.",
      "Smith disagreed, pointing to evidence that he said shows the new Texas maps were actually driven mainly by partisan politics rather than race.",
      "The judge cited testimony from one of the mapmakers, Adam Kincaid, who explained at length why he made certain decisions to shift around the boundaries of congressional districts. Smith said Kincaid \"had a perfectly legitimate and candidly partisan explanation for his every decision.\"",
      "Smith also noted at one point that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who pushed to redraw his state's maps in response to Texas, \"took a victory lap\" after this week's ruling.",
      "\"That tells you all that you need to know\u2014this is about partisan politics, plain and simple,\" Smith said.",
      "In response Wednesday night, Newsom wrote on X: \"This judge says California's redistricting in response to Texas was overwhelmingly partisan. Yes, ours was. That was the ENTIRE POINT!\"",
      "Smith claimed the \"main winners from Judge Brown's opinion are George Soros and Gavin Newsom.\" He alleged Soros, the liberal megadonor, and his son, Alex Soros, \"have their hands all over this,\" claiming several lawyers and experts for the plaintiffs have links to groups that have received funding from the Soros family's Open Society Foundations.",
      "And Smith warned that, if the decision stands, it could disrupt next year's congressional races.",
      "\"As a legal and practical matter, Judge Brown's injunction turns the Texas electoral and political landscape upside down,\" he said. \"It creates mayhem, chaos, misinformation, and confusion.\"",
      "The League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the plaintiffs, said Smith's claim that the redistricting was purely political is \"flatly contradicted by the record.\" The group also rejected Smith's claim that the ruling would lead to \"chaos,\" saying the \"true risk would be allowing an unlawful, racially discriminatory map to stand.\"",
      "\"Protecting voters from racial discrimination is not activism; it is a constitutional obligation,\" LULAC CEO Juan Proa\u00f1o said. \"The majority acted responsibly to uphold the law and safeguard the rights of millions of Texans.\"",

      "The president announced earlier this week that they would meet in Washington, but they had not set a date for the meeting at that time.",
      "Mr. Trump often spoke out against Mamdani in the months leading up to the mayoral election, frequently calling the democratic socialist a \"communist.\" In his post announcing Friday's meeting, he referred to the mayor-elect as \"Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran 'Kwame' Mamdani.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Wednesday he has signed a bill that requires the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days, after months of controversy that ended with the House and Senate passing the bill by nearly unanimous margins this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the bill-signing in a Truth Social post that lashed out at prominent Democrats with links to Epstein.",
      "\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" the president wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump endorsed the legislation over the weekend, after a handful of House Republicans joined with Democratic lawmakers and forced the House to hold a vote. The legislation passed the House 427-1 on Tuesday and moved through the Senate unanimously.",
      "Mr. Trump's support for the bill marks an about-face after the president had urged Republicans to avoid focusing on the Epstein issue for months, calling the push for more federal records on Epstein to be released a distraction tactic.",
      "Maria Farmer, who accused Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, of sexual abuse in the 1990s, said the bill-signing was a \"long time coming.\"",
      "\"I have waited nearly three decades for answers about how my reports of abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were investigated by federal authorities,\" she said in a statement. \"After being left in the dark for decades, having my repeated calls for transparency and action ignored, and living through nearly five administrations that turned a blind eye to this enormous travesty of justice, Congress finally listened to survivors.\"",
      "Farmer is currently suing the FBI, which she alleges ignored her initial sexual assault accusation. She said Wednesday that the bill's passage \"doesn't absolve the government and law enforcement's enormous failure to do its job the past 30 years.\"",
      "\"I hope to see the government make good on its promise of transparency and release the entirety of the files \u2013 not bits and pieces, not mass redactions but the complete truth, removing only child sexual abuse material and victim names and identifying information,\" she said.",
      "What will the Epstein files bill do?",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to make public all of the Justice Department and FBI's unclassified records, communications and investigative materials related to Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator, Maxwell.",
      "It's not clear what new documents will emerge, but Epstein and Maxwell were at the center of a series of federal investigations dating back nearly two decades. Tens of thousands of pages of records on their cases have been released by lawmakers in recent months, including files held by the government and Epstein's estate.",
      "Epstein was initially investigated by federal and local authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended with him controversially agreeing to plead guilty to state prostitution charges in exchange for avoiding a federal indictment. Then, in 2019, he was charged in New York federal court with sex trafficking of minors, but he died by suicide while in federal custody. Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking a year later and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "The case has drawn years of public fascination, including speculation and conspiracy theories spurred by Epstein's extensive ties to wealthy and powerful people. Democrats have criticized Mr. Trump for his yearslong friendship with Epstein, while Mr. Trump has scrutinized former President Bill Clinton for his relationship with the late financier. Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and representatives for Clinton say he was not aware of Epstein's crimes. Neither Mr. Trump nor Clinton has been accused of illegality or charged with a crime, and both have denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The Trump administration has faced calls from both sides to release more information on Epstein \u2014 and criticism from its own allies after some administration officials had promised further disclosures.",
      "In February, Bondi gave out binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" to a group of right-wing influencers, but she faced backlash after the influencers said much of the information was already public.",
      "Five months later, the Justice Department and FBI finished a review of the Epstein case and concluded that there was no incriminating \"client list,\" no evidence that he blackmailed prominent people and no evidence that would support an investigation into anybody else. The review also found that he died by suicide while awaiting trial in 2019. Some Trump supporters were dissatisfied and unconvinced by the findings.",
      "The push to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act was led by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie. Seeking to navigate around GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson's skepticism of the bill, the pair circulated a \"discharge petition,\" a procedural move that requires the House to vote on a bill if a majority of its members sign on.",
      "The petition drew support from four Republicans, including Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a onetime Trump ally who has increasingly broken with her party in recent weeks. Mr. Trump announced last week he was withdrawing his endorsement of Greene, which the Georgia lawmaker speculated was driven by the Epstein issue.",
      "For weeks, the petition sat at 217 signatures \u2014 one short of the number needed to force a vote \u2014 as newly elected Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva awaited her swearing-in ceremony after winning her seat in a September special election. Democrats accused Johnson of slow-walking Grijalva's swearing-in due to the Epstein bill, but Johnson said the delay was because the House remained out of session during the government shutdown.",
      "Grijalva signed the petition last week, forcing the House to hold a vote. Within days, Mr. Trump encouraged House Republicans to vote for the bill, leading it to pass easily on Tuesday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House blocked an effort to formally censure Republican Rep. Cory Mills of Florida and strip him of his committee assignments over allegations related to federal contracting violations, stolen valor and assault.",
      "GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced the censure resolution earlier Wednesday, citing troubling allegations against the congressman.",
      "She introduced the resolution as privileged, meaning GOP leadership had two legislative days to hold a floor vote on the measure. Mills successfully maneuvered to effectively kill the resolution by referring it to the House Ethics Committee.",
      "\"All the accusations and false things that are being said will be proven to be absolutely false in many ways,\" Mills said ahead of the vote. \"And I have the evidence and receipts.\"",
      "The vote came hours after the Ethics Committee announced it is investigating Mills for alleged campaign finance violations, sexual misconduct and other potential wrongdoing. Mace called the investigation \"a naked attempt to kill my resolution.\"",
      "Mills has faced a number of controversies this year, including allegations that he threatened to release nude photos of a former girlfriend, which prompted a judge to grant a protective order in October. The censure resolution also cites reports that Mills was investigated for potential domestic violence in February. Mills has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime.",
      "\"Cory Mills' alleged conduct makes him unfit to serve on any committee responsible for our national security,\" Mace said in a statement.",
      "\"I will not stand by while women risk everything to come forward with credible allegations of abuse and threats. I will not stay silent while a Member of Congress may be lining his pockets through federal contracts. And I will not look the other way while allegations of stolen valor, a slap in the face to every veteran who earned their service and sacrifice, goes unchecked,\" she said.",
      "The financial allegations revolve around a report by a congressional watchdog in August 2024 that found Mills may have misrepresented information on his campaign finance disclosure forms and may have \"entered into, held, or enjoyed contracts with federal agencies while he was a Member of Congress in violation of House rules, standards of conduct, and federal law.\"",
      "Mace's resolution also stated that \"individuals who served in the military with Representative Cory Mills have called into question the veracity of the account of events which formed the basis of a recommendation that ... Mills receive an award of a Bronze Star, bestowed in 2021, for his service under enemy fire in Iraq in 2003.\"",
      "In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson earlier Wednesday, Mace expressed \"grave concern regarding the fitness\" of Mills and urged the Louisiana Republican to take action to remove him from his committee assignments. Mills serves on the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "Mace's effort followed attempts from Democrats to formally rebuke him in retaliation for censure measures that GOP members brought against Democrats for their conduct.",
      "Democrats threatened to force a vote on another censure measure against Mills on Tuesday if Republicans had succeeded in censuring Del. Stacey Plaskett, a Democrat from the Virgin Islands. The push to punish Plaskett came after revelations that she was texting convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a House Oversight Committee hearing in 2019. The messages were released last week by the House Oversight Committee, which has made tens of thousands of documents public as part of its investigation into the Epstein case.",

      "But the panel also found that even though his initial ruling had been struck down, Boasberg, who is the chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., could continue his probe into whether the Trump administration had violated his court order.",
      "\"The district court's order here was a measured and essential response to what it reasonably perceived as shocking executive branch conduct,\" Judges Nina Pillard, Robert Wilkins and Bradley Garcia wrote in a joint opinion.",
      "\"I will be going forward with it,\" Boasberg said. \"I certainly intend to find out what happened that day.\"",
      "In April, Boasberg wrote that the Justice Department's actions were \"sufficient for the court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt. The court does not reach such [a] conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.\"",
      "\"The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders \u2014 especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "Boasberg will also continue to hear arguments on the merits of the case, which arose after the president issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a seldom-invoked law from 1798, to summarily deport Venezuelans whom his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "After Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a group of Venezuelan migrants immediately sued to prevent their removal under the more than 200-year-old wartime law. Boasberg swiftly blocked the Trump administration from removing the plaintiffs from the U.S. for 14 days and, in an emergency hearing, ordered government lawyers to return to the U.S. people subject to the proclamation who were on planes headed toward El Salvador.",
      "The judge then blocked the Trump administration from conducting deportations of noncitizens in its custody under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg's order did not block the government from deporting the alleged gang members or others under other immigration authorities, however.",
      "But Boasberg said that after his orders, the government did not stop the removal process under the Alien Enemies Act, and planes carrying migrants subject to deportation under the invocation of the act later landed in El Salvador, where most were transferred to its Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT.",
      "Remarks by Trump administration officials raised questions for Boasberg regarding whether it had violated his\u00a0 order. In his opinion, Boasberg wrote that \"boasts\" by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele \"intimated that they had defied the court's order deliberately and gleefully.\"",
      "Who, exactly, in the Trump administration ordered the two planes to continue on to El Salvador, is unclear.",
      "On Wednesday, Boasberg said that he plans to find that out through further proceedings and live witness testimony under oath, if needed.",
      "Potential witnesses, Boasberg said, include Erez Reuveni, who admitted in court that the Justice Department should not have deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia in March and was put on leave and then fired by the Justice Department.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes\", Reuveni said he was called to a meeting with Emil Bove, who was then the No. 3 in charge at the Justice Department and is now a federal judge, and Bove told him to potentially ignore court orders if a judge tried to slow the Alien Enemies Act deportations that were underway.",
      "\"Bove emphasized, those planes need to take off, no matter what,\" Reuveni said. \"Then after a pause, he also told all in attendance, and if some court should issue an order preventing that, we may have to consider telling that court, 'f*** you.'\"",
      "Another likely witness, Boasberg said, is Drew Ensign, a deputy assistant attorney general who was the attorney of record in the first hearings in the case.",
      "In court, Boasberg asked Ensign if he understood the verbal orders to turn the plane around and if Ensign understood if the order was immediate. Ensign said he did, but the planes never turned around.",
      "He said he's likely to hold his first hearing on the contempt investigation the week after Thanksgiving.",
      "\"Justice requires me to move promptly on this,\" Boasberg said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-vote-500k-lawsuits-senators-shutdown-deal/",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 21:05:13 -0500",
    "summary": "House lawmakers moved quickly to repeal a provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 over phone record seizures. It's unclear what the Senate will do.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House unanimously passed a bill Wednesday to repeal a\u00a0controversial provision\u00a0that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if federal investigators search their phone records without their knowledge.",
      "House leaders fast-tracked the bill under suspension of the rules, which requires a two-thirds majority for passage. The bill easily cleared the lower chamber in a 426 to 0 vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Tuesday that he wasn't sure how the upper chamber would approach the legislation, but he defended the provision allowing the lawsuits.",
      "\"The House isn't implicated in what we did. It just simply applies to the Senate,\" he said. \"There's a statute that obviously was violated and what this does is enables people who are harmed \u2014 in this case, United States senators \u2014 to have a private right of action against the weaponization by the Justice Department.\"",
      "The new law requires service providers to notify senators if their phone records or other data are seized or subpoenaed. A court cannot delay notification unless the senator is the target of a criminal investigation.",
      "The bill states: \"Any senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any federal department or agency.\"",
      "Senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation under the new law, which also limits how the government can rebut the claims. The law is retroactive to 2022, meaning it would allow at least eight senators to sue the federal government over their phone records being seized during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "The provision was tucked into a yearlong measure to fund the legislative branch, which passed Congress last week as part of a broader package to end the government shutdown. Thune told reporters Wednesday that he takes the fact that some lawmakers were unaware of the provision as a \"legitimate criticism in terms of the process.\"",
      "\"But I think on the substance, I believe that you need to have some sort of accountability and consequence for that kind of weaponization against a co-equal independent branch of the government,\" he added.",
      "As the package moved through the House Rules Committee last week, Democrats tried to amend the bill to remove the provision. Several Republicans on the committee expressed surprise and anger over the provision's inclusion, but said they had to support the overall package to reopen the government because removing it would prolong the shutdown by sending the amended bill back to the Senate.",
      "\"What they did is wrong,\" GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia said last week. \"There's actually a list of people that know they will get paid as soon as this thing is signed \u2014 at least they've got the coupon where all they have to do is go file at the courthouse to get paid.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas called the provision \"self-serving\" and criticized its last-minute insertion into the bill without any debate.",
      "\"It is beside my comprehension that this got put in the bill, and it's why people have such a low opinion of this town,\" Roy said.",
      "Citing the provision, Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, refused to vote for the funding package to reopen the government.",
      "After a conversation with Thune last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the South Dakota Republican \"regretted the way it was done.\" Johnson said the Senate's move was \"way out of line.\"",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said he did not ask Thune to commit to holding a vote in the Senate, but he expected the chamber to do so.",
      "Johnson said Wednesday he met with Thune and hoped the Senate would take up the bill.",
      "\"We'll have that discussion,\" Johnson told reporters.",
      "The Republican senators whose phone records were subpoenaed as part of Smith's election interference investigation were: Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.",
      "Most of the eight senators said they do not plan to seek damages under the new law. And Thune said it isn't about the money, but the principle.",
      "\"I don't think there's anybody that was targeted for whom the money matters,\" he said.",
      "Graham, however, indicated he plans to take action.",
      "\"If you think I'm going to settle this thing for a million dollars \u2014 no,\" he said last week. \"I want to make it so painful no one ever does this again.\"",
      "Still, Thune said \"everybody's focusing on the private right of action,\" but he said \"the important thing in all of this is, where is the accountability and what is the consequence of bad behavior? And if there's no penalty associated with it, you're going to get more of the same.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Wednesday he is resigning from the board of OpenAI and leaving a number of other roles after last week's release of emails between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI,\" Summers said in a statement.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company and look forward to following their progress,\" he said.",
      "On Wednesday night, Summers went on leave from teaching at Harvard University, with his spokesperson, Steven Goldberg, saying in a statement: \"Mr. Summers has decided it's in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review. His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester.\" A Harvard spokesperson said Summers \"communicated his decision\" to the university.",
      "Summers said earlier this week that he will be stepping back from \"public commitments\" after dozens of messages between him and Epstein were included in a trove of documents from Epstein's estate that was released by the House Oversight Committee last week.",
      "His other departures include positions with Bloomberg News, The New York Times, the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project, the Center for American Progress, the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Summers joined the OpenAI board in 2023.",
      "The emails showed Summers and Epstein communicated regularly during the last years of Epstein's life, even as the accused sex trafficker's public infamy and notoriety grew. Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "The exchanges between Summers and Epstein include one in which they appeared to banter about a woman Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer him advice.",
      "There is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of Summers.",
      "Summers, who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration, was a key economic adviser in the Obama administration. The former president of Harvard University, Summers was teaching two classes at the school.",
      "In a statement on Wednesday, Harvard said it is \"conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\"",
      "On Tuesday, both the House and Senate voted overwhelmingly to require the Justice Department to release its files related to Epstein, sending the bill to President Trump's desk. Mr. Trump called on the Justice Department last week to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton and other high-profile Democrats.",

      "Messages from the tranche of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents released by Congress on Nov. 13 shed new light on the deceased sex offender's effort to court billionaire Bill Gates.",
      "The newly released material from 2017 shows a series of text messages between Epstein and an apparent adviser to Gates, discussing the tech baron and other attendees at an annual banquet in Washington.",
      "Epstein had been hoping to sell Gates on a donor-advised fund, a tax-deductible charitable vehicle Epstein wanted to operate, but that never ultimately materialized.",
      "Gates was interested in the idea, the adviser said, but for the misgivings of one person who didn't want him communicating with Epstein: Gates' then-wife Melinda.",
      "\"He wants to talk to you but his wife won't let him,\" the adviser said. In a series of texts a minute later, the adviser said of Gates, \"he loves you,\" \"he says hi,\" and \"he feels bad about the [donor advised fund] btw He thought great idea but wife wouldn't allow.\"",
      "Later in the day, Epstein suggested to the same person that former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler \"would love to sit with Melinda and give her the other side of Jeffrey.\" A source tells CBS News that meeting never took place.",
      "CBS News previously reported that Ruemmler, who is currently the chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs, was among Epstein's inner circle in the final years of his life. Ruemmler has described it as a business relationship; she is not accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Requests for comment sent to Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates were not immediately returned. The couple divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.",

      "Gates is among a slew of famous and powerful people who have long sought to publicly downplay their connections to Jeffrey Epstein. In some cases, documents have come to light showing they in fact had more involved relationships than they've acknowledged.",
      "Epstein was a prolific networker who sought to build relationships with world leaders, business titans and celebrities, often casting himself as a middleman who could connect the powerful.",
      "His ability to build an elite social circle continued even after he had become a registered sex offender,\u00a0 following a 2008 deal with prosecutors in Florida that allowed Epstein to plead guilty to lesser state charges. He then was able to return to his globetrotting life.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Wednesday formally sent to the Senate a bill that would force the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the final procedural move before the legislation can be sent to President Trump for his signature.",
      "After the House passed the measure in a 427-1 vote on Tuesday, the Senate approved the bill unanimously before it could even be formally transmitted from the lower chamber. With the transmission of the bill Wednesday morning, the bill is formally considered passed, and now heads to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "Mr. Trump, who had initially expressed opposition to the release of the files, is expected to sign the measure into law, after he changed his tune Sunday and urged Republicans to vote in favor of the bill.",
      "With his signature, the Justice Department, FBI and U.S. attorney's offices would be forced to release their files related to Epstein, his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell and other entities connected to them within 30 days. Survivors' personal information and other sensitive material can be withheld or redacted with explanations to Congress.",
      "A long path to passage",
      "The final hurdles for the bill come months after the effort began. After the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures in July, interest in the files has swelled, sparking widespread calls for greater transparency from the Trump administration.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July that would require the Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days. And when Congress returned from recess in September, Massie filed a discharge petition to force a vote on the bill, circumventing GOP leadership. The petition, which required 218 signatures, picked up support from all Democrats and four Republicans, but the final signature needed remained out of reach as Rep. Adelita Grijalva's swearing in was delayed during the government shutdown.",
      "Meanwhile, Republican leaders had pushed back on the discharge petition and underlying legislation, warning against the possible release of sensitive information while touting work from congressional committees to look into the Epstein files. But public pressure on lawmakers to force the release of the documents remained high.",
      "Last week, Grijalva was sworn in and became the final signature needed on the discharge petition and force a vote. On Wednesday, after Mr. Trump gave his blessing, the House voted almost unanimously in favor of the measure.",
      "The Senate quickly followed suit, unanimously agreeing to deem the bill passed once it arrived from the House.",
      "A GOP split",
      "The effort, and the Epstein issue more broadly, often divided Republicans, who faced conflicting pressure from constituents and the administration.",
      "Last week, the president lashed out at Republicans who pushed to release the files, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a long-time supporter. Mr. Trump reversed his endorsement of Greene, calling her a \"traitor,\" after she called his prior opposition to releasing the files a \"huge miscalculation.\"",
      "As the bill approached passage on Tuesday, Khanna spoke of the \"extraordinary political consequences\" suffered by Massie and Greene, along with other Republicans who supported the measure. And Greene lamented that the fight over the disclosure of the Epstein files had \"ripped MAGA apart.\"",
      "The issue also seemed to divide GOP leaders. Johnson led the charge against it in Congress. On Tuesday, even as he expressed concerns about the bill, the speaker voted to move it forward, saying that he expected the Senate to amend it and insisting that Senate Majority Leader John Thune do so. Thune did not, and the bill sailed through the Senate unanimously.",
      "Thune acknowledged Johnson's concerns to reporters ahead of the vote, saying, \"I think there are some things he'd like to change, but you got a 427 to 1 vote, it's probably not likely to happen.\" Johnson told reporters afterward, when asked whether he was frustrated with Thune, that \"I'm frustrated with the process, but I trust Leader Thune.\"",

    "summary": "A judge repeatedly questioned prosecutors about the validity of the indictment returned by a grand jury and its handling by interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department's criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey appears to be on shaky ground as a judge Wednesday repeatedly questioned federal prosecutors about the validity of the indictment returned by a grand jury and how it was handled by interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan.",
      "During a hearing on Comey's bid to have the charges tossed on the grounds his prosecution is vindictive and selective, U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff pressed government lawyers for clarity about the events that surrounded the grand jury proceedings on Sept. 25, when it voted to indict Comey on two counts related to testimony he provided to Congress in September 2020. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Halligan had said in a declaration filed with the federal court in Alexandria on Friday that after she made her presentation to the grand jury, it deliberated for roughly two hours. Halligan said she was then informed by her deputy that the grand jury had rejected one count, but voted to indict Comey on two others.",
      "The indictment was then re-drafted to remove the first count, and listed only the two counts that the grand jury approved, Tyler Lemons, a federal prosecutor working on Comey's case, told Nachmanoff on Wednesday. Lemons said a grand-jury coordinator told prosecutors about the outcome of the vote.",
      "Judge has questions about second indictment",
      "But Nachmanoff questioned whether the second indictment \u2014 with only the two charges \u2014 had been presented to the grand jury and voted on, or given straight to a U.S. magistrate judge. That judge, Lindsey Vaala, presided over the return of the indictment and also expressed confusion as to why she was presented with two documents: The indictment with two counts, and a report of the grand jury's failure to concur in an indictment, which lists three counts.",
      "Lemons said the second indictment was given straight to the judge, and argued it was not a \"new\" indictment, but had been edited only to reflect the grand jury's decision to charge Comey with lying to Congress and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.",
      "Nachmanoff pressed Lemons further, asking if the second indictment was never shown to the entire grand jury. The prosecutor said that was correct. Lemons was not at the proceedings before the grand jury in September. Halligan presented the case by herself.",
      "While Lemons answered most of the judge's questions, Halligan briefly appeared before Nachmanoff to tell him that only the foreperson and another grand juror were in the courtroom when the indictment was presented to the magistrate judge.",
      "One of Comey's attorneys, Michael Dreeben, said moments later that the Justice Department had just acknowledged the indictment was never presented to the grand jury and never returned.",
      "\"There is no indictment that Mr. Comey is facing,\" Dreeben said, adding this is a \"threshold basis\" to dismiss the case with prejudice, which would prohibit prosecutors from re-filing charges. He said there should be no charges against his client because the five-year statute of limitations for Comey's alleged offenses has now expired.",
      "Halligan's presentation before the grand jury and her handling of the indictments have puzzled not only Nachmanoff, but two other judges that have presided over different aspects of Comey's criminal case, which remains in its early stages.",
      "A Justice Department official told CBS News Wednesday evening in a statement that \"the Government remains committed to following the law, respecting grand-jury secrecy, and ensuring that judicial decisions rest on facts\u2014not assumptions. The magistrate judge's order does not meet that standard.\"",
      "Earlier hearing raises questions about transcript of Halligan's grand jury presentation",
      "During a hearing last week on a separate legal issue involving Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney, U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie raised what she said was a missing portion of the transcript from the grand jury proceedings.",
      "The judge said it appeared no court reporter was present during part of Halligan's presentation, or did not transcribe the period at issue. Halligan later said in her declaration Friday that the missing portion reflects the time when the grand jury was deliberating, which must be done without any other person in the room, including a court reporter.",
      "\"There are no missing minutes, contrary to the suggestion raised by the court,\" Halligan wrote.",
      "Another judge raises questions about grand jury transcript",
      "But then, on Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick raised his own issues with the \"completeness\" of the transcript and the manner in which the second indictment was presented to the grand jury.",
      "Fitzpatrick said the second indictment was new, and he concluded after reviewing the grand-jury transcript that Halligan would've presented it to the grand jury for consideration before it was returned in open court.",
      "\"It now appears that may not have happened,\" he wrote.",
      "Citing the timeline that Halligan laid out in her filing, the judge said the short time span between when she learned that the grand jury rejected one count in the initial indictment and when she appeared in court to return the second indictment \u2014 which is about seven minutes \u2014 \"could not have been sufficient\" to draft and sign the second document, present it to the grand jury, provide legal instructions and give them a chance to deliberate and render a decision.",
      "\"If the prosecutor is mistaken about the time she received notification of the grand jury's vote on the original indictment, and this procedure did take place, then the transcript and audio recording provided to the Court are incomplete,\" Fitzpatrick wrote in an order. \"If this procedure did not take place, then the Court is in uncharted legal territory in that the indictment returned in open court was not the same charging document presented to and deliberated upon by the grand jury.\"",
      "He ordered federal prosecutors to turn over all grand jury material to Comey's defense team, and criticized the Justice Department for what he described as a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in its handling of the case.",
      "Fitzpatrick wrote that there is \"the prospect that government misconduct may have tainted the grand jury proceedings.\"",
      "The Justice Department official told CBS News Wednesday that \"the grand jury transcript \u2014 which Magistrate Judge Fitzpatrick read \u2014 speaks for itself. When read in full, it shows no misstatement of law, no improper instruction, and no basis for the extraordinary remedy of breaching grand-jury secrecy. Partial snippets cannot overcome the actual record.\"",

      "When it comes to the growing feud between Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of President Trump's earliest and most vocal supporters, there is faith, loyalty, and a respect for being true to one's own self.",

    "summary": "The court ruling came after California voters formally approved a ballot measure that was introduced to counteract Texas' redistricting.",
    "story": [
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom said California's redistricting was in response to Texas' rare mid-decade redistricting push. That doesn't mean California is turning back after a federal court in Texas blocked the state's recently redrawn congressional map from going into effect for the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Tuesday's court ruling came weeks after California voters formally approved a ballot measure that was introduced to counteract Texas' redistricting \u2014 but lawmakers removed the trigger language from the ballot measure. Without the trigger language, changes to California's districts are unlikely.",
      "\"Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned and democracy won,\" Newsom wrote on X Tuesday following the court ruling. \"This ruling is a win for Texas, and for every American who fights for free and fair elections.\"",
      "Paul Mitchell, whose firm was hired to draw California's congressional districts, posted on social media that the maps will be staying in place.",
      "\"The trigger language was removed in the legislative process as it was clear that TX was redistricting. So, even if their map is invalidated/postponed, the Prop 50 maps stay in place,\" Mitchell wrote.",
      "Earlier this year, Texas lawmakers redrew their congressional maps in a rare mid-decade redistricting effort, kicked off after President Trump pushed for new congressional district boundaries that could help secure five Republican-friendly seats.",
      "The move set off a redistricting battle across the U.S., with\u00a0 Newsom \u2014- a potential 2028 presidential candidate \u2014\u00a0 leading an effort to neutralize potential Republican gains in Texas by redrawing California's own congressional lines to net up to five seats for Democrats.",
      "In August, California lawmakers approved several bills to redraw the state's congressional map to potentially make five Republican-held congressional districts more favorable to Democrats. Because the measures required changes to the state's constitution, they had to be put before voters in a special election.",
      "Earlier this month, California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, setting the stage for newly-drawn congressional maps for the 2026 midterms.",
      "California lawmakers removed trigger clause",
      "When California state lawmakers had initially introduced their redistricting legislation, it included a trigger clause under which California would only redraw its congressional map in response to a similar move by a Republican state.",
      "Under that trigger language, California's redistricting map would \"become operative only if Texas, Florida, or another state adopts a new congressional district map that takes effect after Aug. 1, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2031, and such redistricting is not required by a federal court order.\"",
      "However, the trigger clause was removed just before California lawmakers voted on the redistricting bills. Without that trigger language, as it stands now, the Texas ruling does not impact California's redrawn map.",
      "During an August press conference, Newsom was asked if California would move forward with Proposition 50 even if a court were to strike down Texas' maps.",
      "\"We're moving forward,\" Newsom responded. \"Texas moved forward. Texas acted. Texas is moving forward. You're suggesting, people are suggesting. Texas is not going to move forward because of what we just did? Come on.\"",
      "The Trump administration has sued California over its new congressional lines. A hearing is scheduled for Dec 3.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration denounced the ruling striking down Texas' maps. Texas on Tuesday afternoon appealed the ruling striking down its maps to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"We strongly disagree with today's district court ruling on Texas's redistricting map - Texas's map was drawn the right way for the right reasons,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X. \"We look forward to Texas's victory at the Supreme Court.\"",
      "According to Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, the ruling invalidating Texas maps would not have an effect on California's redistricting efforts given the facts that were considered by the court.",
      "\"Texas maps were struck down by the court based on how Texas actually drew the lines, and that has very little to do with how California drew their lines,\" Levitt told CBS News.",
      "In the Texas ruling, in a 2-1 decision, federal judges found \"substantial evidence\" that \"Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.\" The court considered a letter that the Justice Department sent to Texas lawmakers in July stating the state's 2021 map was \"unconstitutional\" because it included four congressional districts where no ethnic group had an outright majority, concluding that the state must therefore dismantle and redraw its lines.",
      "The court found this to be a \"legally incoherent assertion.\"",
      "\"California didn't do anything like that,\" Levitt said. \"California drew districts overwhelmingly for partisan reasons and there's actually nothing that the litigants in California have pointed to that indicates that California focused predominantly or excessively based on race.\"",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on a dispute over Louisiana's congressional map and whether race can be used as a factor when drawing districts. In October, justices appeared poised to weaken a key provision, Section 2, of the Voting Rights Act that has allowed the consideration of race when drawing districts, and has been used to ensure minority voters have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.",
      "This could lead to more redistricting efforts as states eliminate race as a factor for their standing congressional voting lines.",
      "\"It is terribly disturbing that this is where we are at,\" Texas Democratic state Rep. Ramon Romero told CBS News. \"A point where communities that have been so grossly underrepresented for basically our entirety of the history of our country and now that there's growth in opportunity, there's growth in education, there's growth in representation, those wealthy billionaires that are manipulating our country for their benefit have won at the expense of so many families and people of color.\"",
      "Romero was among the Texas lawmakers who broke quorum in August by leaving the state in attempts to block the GOP-backed congressional maps. Though he says today's ruling was a victory for Democrats, much remains to be determined after the Supreme Court weighs in.",
      "The timing of a Supreme Court decision is unknown, but the clock is ticking for Texas. Congressional candidates have until Dec. 8 to file to run for next year's midterm election and appear on the primary ballot set for March.",

In it, Patel writes: \"I have determined that you exercised poor judgment with an inappropriate display of political signage in your work area during your previous assignment at the Los Angeles Field Office. Pursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution and the laws of the United States, your employment with the Federal Bureau of Investigation is hereby terminated.\"",
      "The FBI had no comment regarding Maltinsky's lawsuit.",

      "In an hourlong interview with CBS News, Maltinsky said his firing has had a chilling impact inside the Bureau.",
      "\"The ripple effect of fear has been felt. Many gay colleagues have removed Pride flags from their desks, allies have removed Pride flags from their desk,\" he said.",
      "\"David's dream was to serve our country as an FBI Special Agent,\" said Christopher M. Mattei, counsel for Maltinsky and a partner at Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, PC. \"When that dream was cruelly taken from him, he stayed true to his oath and is now fighting to protect the rights of all Americans.\"",
      "\"This case is about far more than one man's career\u2014it's about whether the government can punish Americans simply for saying who they are,\" Mattei said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-comey-indictment-vindictive-selective-prosecution/",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:11:02 -0500",
    "summary": "In court Wednesday, former FBI Director James Comey sought to have the criminal charges against him dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "The federal judge overseeing the criminal case of former FBI Director James Comey questioned the Justice Department in a contentious hearing Wednesday about the leadup to his indictment and whether or not the grand jury was presented with the final version.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff is considering Comey's effort to have the two-count federal indictment against him dismissed on the grounds that it is based on a \"vindictive and selective\" prosecution.",
      "The government sought to defend its indictment, but was peppered with questions from Nachmanoff about whether there had been a declination memo written by federal prosecutors who had overseen the investigation into Comey before Lindsey Halligan took over as interim U.S. attorney. Such a memo would outline the reasons not to pursue a prosecution.",
      "Tyler Lemons, arguing for the Justice Department, said there was \"written correspondence of whether to pursue charges\" but also said that any he had been directed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's office to not answer \u2014 because some material could be privileged, and a decision to waive that privilege has not been made.",
      "Lemons did tell the court, however, that a prosecution memo had been prepared.",
      "Nachmanoff also questioned Lemons about whether the correct indictment of Comey was ever actually presented to the full grand jury for a vote. He asked Lemons about the timing of the presentation and the two different indictments that emerged in the case. Nachmanoff suggested the record shows that Halligan took the three-count indictment \u2014 which contained one count that was rejected \u2014 and merely made \"edits to reflect the vote of the grand jury as to the two counts,\" as Lemons put it, without presenting the updated version to the grand jury. Lemons acknowledged the updated indictment that reflected the two charges was not shown to the grand jury.",
      "The hearing was the second in two weeks stemming from Comey's bids to dismiss the criminal charges, which stem from testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee more than five years ago. Comey has pleaded not guilty to both charges and has argued that the prosecution is a result of Mr. Trump's efforts to target a political foe.",
      "During arguments on Wednesday, one of Comey's attorneys, Michael Dreeben, said that the Justice Department's prosecution of his client is part of President Trump's effort to \"punish and deter\" those who speak out against him, citing a \"pattern\" of Comey speaking out against Mr. Trump and in turn, the president attacking him. Dreeben said that pattern began after the president fired Comey from his role leading the FBI in 2017.",
      "\"The government cannot use the power of prosecution in an attempt to silence a critic,\" he said.",
      "Comey's lawyer pointed to a social media post from Mr. Trump on Sept. 20 in which he appeared to direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey as well as two other Democrats, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff.",
      "Dreeben said the post is an \"admission this is a political prosecution.\" Mr. Trump, he said, effectively substituted himself for the U.S. attorney as the decision maker in prosecuting Comey.",
      "Comey's legal team is asking the court to dismiss the indictment with prejudice, so prosecutors cannot re-file charges. Dreeben said that remedy is needed because of the stakes of the case.",
      "The nation has never before seen a \"blatant use of criminal justice to achieve political ends,\" he said.",
      "Defendants must clear a high bar in order to win the dismissal of an indictment on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive and selective.",
      "For vindictive prosecution, the defendant must show that the prosecutor acted with \"genuine animus\" toward him, and that prosecutor pursued charges to punish the defendant for exercising a protected right.",
      "In a claim of selective prosecution, the defendant must show that the government was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, either by demonstrating that similarly situated individuals were spared from prosecution or that the decision to bring charges was \"invidious or in bad faith.\"",
      "Comey's lawyers have argued in filings that direct evidence establishes that Mr. Trump harbors \"genuine animus\" toward Comey based on his protected speech and the president's \"arbitrary personal bias.\" The former FBI chief has repeatedly spoken out against Mr. Trump's conduct in office and in response, the president has \"resorted to personal attacks and calls to retaliate against Mr. Comey through punishment and imprisonment,\" defense lawyers wrote.",
      "To demonstrate the breadth of Mr. Trump's dislike of Comey, his lawyers provided the court with nearly 60 pages of social media posts from the president dating back to May 2017 in which he attacks and accuses the former FBI director of wrongdoing.",
      "\"As a private citizen, Mr. Comey has vigorously and prominently exercised his First Amendment right to criticize President Trump. In response, President Trump has repeatedly attacked and threatened Mr. Comey,\" Comey's lawyers wrote. \"That pattern began soon after Mr. Comey's May 2017 termination as FBI Director and has continued up until \u2014 and even after \u2014 the indictment in this case.\"",
      "Defense lawyers also highlighted the timing of Comey's indictment \u2014 sought days before the five-year statute of limitations expired \u2014 and the fact that it was pursued only after the president installed his former personal defense lawyer and White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who did not have any prosecutorial experience before being tapped to lead the Virginia prosecutors' office. She replaced Erik Siebert in the role, whose abrupt departure came amid concerns he would be removed for failing to bring a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, another critic of the president.",
      "\"With the statute-of-limitations deadline looming and no career prosecutor \u2014 not even President Trump's own interim U.S. Attorney (Mr. Siebert) \u2014 willing to seek the indictment, the President took matters into his own hands by directing his Attorney General to seek 'JUSTICE' against Mr. Comey and to unlawfully appoint a White House aide who would prosecute this case. She then immediately did so,\" they wrote in court filings.",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Nachmanoff asked Comey's legal team if Halligan was a \"puppet\" and \"stalking horse\" who was taking orders from the White House.",
      "\"She did what she was told to do,\" Dreeben said.",
      "In defense of Comey's indictment and Halligan's conduct, Lemons argued that it was \"her decision and her decision only\" to seek an indictment of the former FBI director. He added there was \"no proof\" anyone at the White House or Justice Department spoke to Halligan ahead of the indictment being presented to the grand jury.",
      "\"Ms. Halligan was not directed to pursue this prosecution,\" Lemons said, adding she was \"not a puppet.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyers responded by arguing in court filings that Comey \"weaves a tale\" through \"news reports, social media posts, and speculation\" that does not meet the \"rigorous legal standard\" to dismiss the case.",
      "They argued that numerous high-ranking government officials have been prosecuted for lying to Congress about official actions. The department also argued that Comey has not alleged that Halligan, who sought the indictment, harbored animus against Comey, and there is no evidence that Mr. Trump displaced her as the decision-maker in bringing the prosecution.",
      "\"The true affront to the criminal justice system would be to allow the defendant to escape accountability for lying to and obstructing Congress under oath about actions he took while serving as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" prosecutors wrote. \"The indictment was presented by a duly appointed and unbiased prosecutor. And a duly constituted grand jury found probable cause that he committed the indicted offenses.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyers also pointed to Mr. Trump's years of social media posts about Comey, but said they show the president's view that Comey committed a crime preceded the former FBI director's public criticism of the president.",
      "They said Comey was prosecuted because of his \"extraordinary conduct\" and \"flagrant violation\" of the public's trust by allegedly lying to Congress.",
      "\"The Executive cannot be expected to ignore agency heads lying about official actions simply because they later become outspoken critics,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Comey's motion claiming selective and vindictive prosecution is one of several pursued by his defense team that aim to have the charges dismissed before the start of a trial.",
      "As proceedings have moved forward in the weeks since his indictment in late September, prosecutors have run into issues that could doom their case.",
      "On Monday, a federal magistrate judge took what he called the \"extraordinary remedy\" of ordering federal prosecutors to turn over all grand jury materials to Comey's defense team, citing a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in the case, including potential issues with how the Justice Department handled evidence used in the grand jury presentation and how Halligan conducted herself in front of the grand jury.",
      "Nachmanoff, has temporarily paused that order while the Justice Department appeals it.",
      "Comey's legal team also argued alongside New York Attorney General Letitia James' legal team last week that the indictments against them should be dismissed because Halligan's appointment was unlawful. James was indicted last month on federal mortgage fraud charges and has pleaded not guilty. The federal judge who heard arguments on that issue said she would have a ruling on the validity of Halligan's appointment by Thanksgiving.",

    "summary": "President Trump said the U.S. is getting involved in peace efforts in Sudan at the request of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the U.S. is getting involved in efforts to strike peace in Sudan amid an ongoing civil war there, at the request of his \"very good friend\" Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump made the announcement Wednesday as he spoke at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, one day after a lengthy meeting with the crown prince, known as MBS, in the Oval Office. The State Department has already said the U.S. has been working with international partners, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, to broker an end to the war, but the president said he views the situation \"differently now than I did just a day ago.\"",
      "The people of Sudan are suffering from a staggering humanitarian crisis, as the two-and-a-half-year war takes its toll. The power struggle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, has displaced millions, sparked famine and led to claims of genocide. Mr. Trump said he wasn't planning to get involved in the yearslong conflict in Sudan, but the crown prince suggested he add Sudan to his list of peace deals he has helped broker. The United Nations says what's happening in Sudan is the greatest humanitarian crisis on Earth.",
      "\"His majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan,\" Mr. Trump told his audience at the U.S.-Saudi business forum. \"It was not on my charts to be involved in that. ... But I just see how important that is to you and to a lot of your friends in the room, Sudan, and we're going to start working on Sudan.\"",
      "The president's announcement was met with great applause in the room. Mr. Trump said his administration got started on working for peace in Sudan about half an hour after his meeting with MBS concluded Tuesday.",
      "\"And you know we've already started working on that, OK?\" he said.",
      "Earlier this month, a State Department spokesperson told reporters the Trump administration was engaging directly with the RSF and the Sudanese army, and called on both sides to \"move forward in response to the U.S.-led effort to conclude a humanitarian truce, given the immediate urgency of de-escalating the violence and ending the suffering of the Sudanese people.\"",
      "But the president's push for action draws more focus to the region, while spotlighting MBS' influence. Mr. Trump has emphasized his excellent relationship with MBS, as well as the \"great wealth\" the Saudis are pouring into the U.S.",
      "MBS announced Tuesday in the Oval Office that a planned $600 billion investment in the U.S. from Saudi entities would be closer to $1 trillion. The two leaders also signed what the president called a \"historic\" and \"strategic\" defense agreement, and the U.S. will be selling the Saudis extensive military equipment.",
      "The crown prince's visit has been filled with fanfare, complete with a military jet flyover, cannon fire and an elaborate White House dinner with some of the richest people in the world. But more meaningful to MBS is what Mr. Trump has said on camera about the leader of the country with a troubled human rights record.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's intelligence agencies in 2018 determining the crown prince ordered the killing of journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, Mr. Trump claimed in the Oval Office that MBS \"knew nothing about\" it. The president criticized reporters for asking questions about Khashoggi and Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Families of the victims are suing the Saudi government, and a federal judge reviewing thousands of pages of evidence from the attacks concluded the families can move forward with their case.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",

    "story": [
      "Annie Farmer, who testified that she was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0and Ghislaine Maxwell when she was 16 years old, said Congress' vote on the Epstein files \"feels like a victory, a long overdue victory.\"",
      "Both chambers of Congress passed a bill that would force the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files following President Trump's signature.",
      "Farmer said she believes the files contain information \"that we have not heard before.\"",
      "\"In terms of names of people that not only participated in these crimes but the people that enabled the crimes and the people that funded the crimes,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" on Wednesday.",
      "The Senate unanimously approved the Epstein Files Transparency Act to compel the documents release, following the House's 427 to 1 vote. The passage comes after months of opposition by many Republicans, including Mr. Trump, who recently changed his stance.",
      "\"I think that they felt pressure to get on the right side of history here because it was becoming so clear that this wasn't going away, that people cared about it,\" Farmer said.",
      "\"I feel hopeful\"",
      "Now, Farmer is hopeful for transparency, adding Tuesday's moment was bittersweet because of what it took to get there.",
      "\"I feel hopeful not because I have a lot of trust in the political process, but because of what I've seen, what is possible when people come together and demand something and pressure is placed by the American people here,\" she said. \"I appreciate everyone who spoke out about this.\"",
      "But she admitted she still has concerns about getting full transparency.",
      "Farmer's sister, Maria, who is also a survivor of Epstein's abuse and was one of the first in 1996 to report it to law enforcement, has made Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to investigations of Epstein over the years.",
      "\"The things that have been released have been heavily redacted and, therefore, you know, really not very helpful,\" Farmer said.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump asked the Department of Justice to investigate Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats, even though the FBI said over the summer that they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of Epstein-related materials and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "\"So these files should be available now. They should not be tied up in any kind of investigation,\" she said. \"But we're concerned about things like that, that might get in the way of what we're looking for.\"",
      "Maxwell's sentence",
      "Farmer testified at Maxwell's trial in 2021. A key accuser in the trial, Farmer said that she went to Epstein's New Mexico ranch in 1996 hoping he and Maxwell would help with academic endeavors. Farmer told jurors at the trial that Maxwell allegedly massaged her breasts and Epstein climbed into bed with her without her permission.",
      "Earlier this month, CBS News reported Maxwell planned to ask Mr. Trump to commute her sentence, according to documents obtained by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "\"She needs to serve her full sentence,\" Farmer said about Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for her role in the Epstein sex abuse case.",
      "\"She harmed so many more than just individuals that were involved in the trial and so I think to now see her getting this special treatment and potentially be receiving some kind of pardon, it's really unfathomable,\" Farmer said.",
      "In a letter from Democrats to Mr. Trump, which was seen by CBS News, the lawmakers alleged Maxwell was receiving preferential treatment.",
      "\"Federal law enforcement staff working at the camp have been waiting on Ms. Maxwell hand and foot,\" says the letter signed by Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee.",
      "\"I think it's absolutely disgusting that she's getting this preferential treatment,\" Farmer said.",
      "Maxwell's attorneys have denied she is trying to get her sentence reduced and that she is receiving preferential treatment, saying, \"It is clear that no effort to fact check the credibility or veracity of the so-called 'whistleblower' was made.\"",
      "Justice and healing",
      "Farmer said what justice looks like is \"a complicated question.\"",
      "\"A big part of it is just recognition of what actually happened here,\" she said.",
      "She said her sister Maria hasn't been given any protections as a whistleblower and has been threatened.",
      "\"I think just the acknowledgment that, 'wow, what you did was so brave and this didn't need to happen.' That there have been mistakes made over and over by law enforcement that we don't want those things to continue happening,\" she said.",

      "Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday as part of a delegation of senior Pentagon officials on a fact-finding mission to discuss military technology and explore ways to restart peace talks, according to multiple U.S. officials.",
      "The delegation includes Driscoll, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, the commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa Gen. Chris Donahue, and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Weimer.",
      "The White House picked Driscoll to lead the delegation, according to one U.S. official. It opted to send a delegation from the Pentagon in part because the officials will be able to speak from a military perspective, which may be more effective in getting through to the Russians, the official said.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported the visit.",
      "\"Secretary Driscoll and team arrived this morning in Kyiv on behalf of the administration on a factfinding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,\" Army spokesman Colonel David Butler said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "During the visit, Driscoll will view Ukrainian technology from the Ukrainian military and defense industry, according to a defense official.",
      "Driscoll told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that Ukraine's use of drones and AI technology is an \"incredible treasure trove of information for future warfare.\" He referred to the stunning surprise attack launched in June by Ukraine deep inside Russia \u2014 Operation Spider's Web \u2014 which used what Driscoll called a \"couple hundred thousand dollars worth of drones\" to destroy Russian equipment valued at about $10 billion. During Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the White House last month, he offered drone technology to the U.S.",
      "Over the course of a few days in Ukraine, Driscoll will also spend time with top Ukrainian leaders and is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy to try to restart negotiations.",
      "A Ukrainian official told CBS the focus of the visit would be on the military situation on the ground in addition to plans for a possible ceasefire. The official said Driscoll's visit \"is extremely important, as we are stepping into a decisive phase now.\"",
      "\"Presidents Zelenskyy and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees,\" the Ukrainian official added, noting that Ukraine has also spoken with the group of over 30 countries that support it. \"Ukraine has also held talks with the \"Coalition of the Willing\" on the security guarantees.\" Ukraine has not agreed to permanently cede that territory to Russia.",
      "\"I think a lot of the questions are, how do we actually execute on the president's agenda of peace in that part of the world,\" Driscoll said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"I have not been to the White House, where it has not come up that we just want peace so that the American industrial base can thrive everywhere, and we have to focus on that part of the world unnecessarily right now.\"",
      "Negotiations to end the war have largely stalled since the spring, even after President Trump attempted to revive them in the summer and fall during a summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin and a meeting at the White House with Zelenskyy.",
      "Since then, the U.S. has resumed intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which has used U.K-provided long-range equipment, as well as drones, to conduct attacks on Russia.",

      "Hours after federal judges blocked Texas from using its newly drawn congressional map, state leaders filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The redrawn map sparked a nationwide redistricting battle and is part of President Trump's efforts to preserve a Republican majority in the House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The Tuesday ruling came in a 2-1 vote by a three-judge panel. It dealt a blow to Republicans while Democrats celebrated it.",
      "That's because under the newly drawn map approved by Republicans, who stood to gain five congressional seats in Texas, the Democrats were facing a game of political musical chairs -- some were set to retire or primary each other. Now, that may not have to happen.",
      "\"Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map,\" which is illegal, the two federal judges who voted to block the map said in the ruling.",
      "They also cited a U.S. Department of Justice letter to Gov. Greg Abbott from July about four coalition districts made up of Blacks and Latinos that include the 33rd Congressional District in North Texas, represented by Democrat Marc Veasey.",
      "\"DOJ threatened legal action if Texas didn't immediately dismantle and redraw these districts, a threat based on their racial makeup. Notably, the DOJ letter targeted only majority non-white districts,\" the judges' ruling said. \"Any mention of majority white districts, which DOJ presumably would have also targeted if its aims were partisan rather than racial, was conspicuously absent.\"",
      "There was no initial word on what the third judge on the panel said in dissenting.",
      "Abbott slams judge's \"erroneous\" decision",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Abbott slammed the judges' decision, calling it \"clearly erroneous\" and saying it \"undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict. The State of Texas will swiftly appeal to the United States Supreme Court.\"",
      "The state filed its appeal to the highest court late Tuesday afternoon.",
      "CBS News Texas spoke with Democratic members of Congress from North Texas who praised the ruling.",
      "\"I totally agree with the court,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Farmers Branch. \"You know, what the Republicans and Greg Abbott did in Texas, to seeking to disenfranchise voters of color was egregious, and the court clearly agreed with that. This opinion is sharp, and it is clear, and it is concise.\"",
      "Veasey, whose district covers Fort Worth, said, \"I feel like we're on good legal grounds here. So, I feel confident, but, you know, I'm going to be again cautiously optimistic in watching what the Supreme Court says.\"",
      "\"I've always made it clear that this was racial, and I know that some people want to run away from the race element, but the law protects it. We know that our Constitution recognizes and protects it,\" said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Dallas.",
      "Texas Republicans criticize judges' decision",
      "CBS News Texas also spoke with Republicans Tuesday night who called the judges' decision wrong and said they are putting their faith in the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Aaron Reitz, a GOP candidate for Texas attorney general, said, \"My view is similar to Gov. Abbott's and Attorney General Paxton, who have criticized the decision because, in fact, race was not used to draw these lines. Only politics was used, which is the appropriate standard.\"",
      "Another candidate for attorney general, State Senator Mayes Middleton, R-Galveston, said it was a partisan map.",
      "\"Quite simply, this is a partisan map that draws more Republican seats and that's why we're going to win,\" said Middleton. \"That is why we're going to be victorious in this appeal before the Supreme Court.\"",
      "As a result of the ruling, Rep. Johnson and Rep. Veasey said they will run for re-election in the districts they represent now.",
      "Crockett she said she still hasn't decided whether to run for re-election in her district in Dallas or if she is going to run statewide for U.S. Senate. She said she is waiting for polling to come back and that she hopes to make a decision by Thanksgiving.",
      "The key, Crockett said, is if the polling shows she can beat a Republican candidate in the general election next November.",
      "\"At the end of the day, if the numbers are strong that I am our best shot, then it's bigger than my district, it's bigger than the state of Texas,\" said Crockett. \"This is about the country because we know if we can change the Senate map in this country, then that's where we start to get wins.\"",
      "Crockett said the only way she or another Democrat can win is if they attract new voters, people who haven't gone to the polls before, and not simply by attracting Republicans who cross the political aisle.",

      "Mr. Trump announced the move at a black-tie dinner at the White House in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders signed a new strategic defense deal earlier in the day, and Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The designation could open the door to further collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. military, including easier access to U.S.-made military equipment. It's also a symbolic move: Mr. Trump said in brief remarks Tuesday evening that it would take \"our military cooperation to even greater heights.\"",
      "There are currently 20 major non-NATO allies, including other Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.",
      "\"A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries, and it will serve the highest interests of peace,\" Mr. Trump said during Tuesday's dinner.",
      "The U.S.'s close relationship with Saudi Arabia dates back eight decades, bookended by a meeting between King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud and former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser in 1945. The two countries have long cooperated on defense, and in recent decades, they have been bound together in part by a mutual rivalry with Iran.",
      "During Tuesday's meetings \u2014 marked by elaborate White House ceremonies and a military flyover \u2014 Mr. Trump pressed for even further military and economic cooperation with the Gulf state. The White House said\u00a0Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will buy hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and will partner with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and civil nuclear issues, while bin Salman pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion in the U.S., up from $600 billion.",
      "Members of Mr. Trump's family also have some business interests in the country. Mr. Trump insisted earlier Tuesday he has \"nothing to do\" with those deals, and \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "Still unclear is whether Saudi Arabia will sign onto the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic deals brokered by Mr. Trump between Israel and majority-Muslim states like the United Arab Emirates. Most of those agreements were inked during the president's first term, and Mr. Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he believes Saudi Arabia will also join.",
      "During an Oval Office event earlier Tuesday, bin Salman told reporters he wants to join the accords but needs to see a path toward a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump added that the two leaders \"had a very good talk on the Abraham Accords.\"",
      "But Saudi Arabia's human rights record makes it a controversial U.S. partner. American intelligence agencies concluded in 2021 that bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who regularly criticized the country's regime in the pages of The Washington Post.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, to the White House with an elaborate military display Tuesday, praising the crown prince and insisting the U.S.-Saudi relationship has never been better as the two countries look to sign major business and national security deals.",
      "The pomp and circumstance \u2014 and the president's praise and warmth toward MBS \u2014 were more typical of a visit from an allied Western democracy than an absolute monarchy with a troubled human rights record, pointing to the president's focus on economic and business ties above virtually all else. The White House sees Saudi Arabia as a critical security partner in a turbulent Middle East, as well as an economic partner.",
      "The White House arrival ceremony for the crown prince on Tuesday morning was laden with fanfare, complete with a U.S. military flyover, cannons, horses, and a red carpet. American and Saudi flags adorned the White House South Lawn, and a military band greeted the Saudi royal. Mr. Trump and the crown prince exchanged greetings as they shook hands, and then watched the formation of F-35 and F-16 fighter jets fly by before going inside the White House.",
      "The crown prince's meeting with the president concluded and MBS departed the White House Tuesday afternoon, though he returned later in the evening for a black-tie dinner in his honor. Guests spotted at the dinner included Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for Saudi team Al-Nassr.",
      "Ahead of bin Salman's arrival, Mr. Trump\u00a0told reporters\u00a0Monday that the U.S. would sell F-35 fighter jets to the Saudis. In the Oval Office, MBS said the Saudis will increase a planned investment of $600 billion in the U.S. to closer to $1 trillion, an announcement that pleased Mr. Trump greatly.",
      "Mr. Trump praised the crown prince in the Oval Office, calling him a \"very good friend\" and insisting his record on human rights is commendable, despite the State Department's long list of concerns of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Arbitrary and unlawful killings, disappearances, torture, serious restrictions on freedom of expression and restrictions on religious freedom continue to plague the nation, according to the latest 2024 State Department report.",
      "The trip to the White House is the crown prince's first U.S. visit since Washington Post journalist and human rights activist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul by members of the Saudi government. The president has smoothed over relations with the Saudis since the CIA assessed about a month after Khashoggi's killing, during Mr. Trump's first term, that the crown prince had\u00a0ordered it.",
      "Bin Salman has denied any involvement, but he\u00a0told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell\u00a0in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview, \"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\"",
      "The Biden administration later released the Trump-era intelligence report concluding the crown prince \"approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\"",
      "Bin Salman was asked about Khashoggi directly in the Oval Office Tuesday, giving U.S. reporters a rare chance to question the future king. \"About the journalist, it's really painful to hear that anyone losing his life for no real purpose,\" MBS said.",
      "The crown prince sought to distance the Saudi government from the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, as families of the attacks criticize the White House for inviting him. Bin Salman said he feels \"painful about families of 9/11 in America,\" but claimed Osama bin Laden used the Saudi people to \"destroy\" the American-Saudi relationship. Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years, drawing\u00a0vehement denials\u00a0from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized members of the media for some of the questions.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",
      "Later in the day Tuesday, the crown prince attended a dinner at the White House. There are 120 invited guests, according to a person familiar with the planning, and 30 will be from the Saudi delegation.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening's dinner is a perfect example of why his large ballroom under construction is necessary. Although it's not a state dinner, it is the first formal dinner hosted by Mr. Trump in his second term to honor a nation's leader. Bin Salman's father, Salman bin Abdulaziz, is technically the head of state of the kingdom, but he delegated his duties as ruler to MBS in 2017.",
      "\"We're more than meeting,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of the visit. \"We're honoring Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy, defense sales and the fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge, which was announced during the president's trip to Saudi Arabia in May.",
      "Mr. Trump is also planning to attend a Saudi business summit in Washington, D.C., Wednesday. An invitation previously obtained by CBS News said the event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia and the U.S.-Saudi Business Council.",
      "Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and former top White House adviser Jared Kushner have fostered close relationships with the Saudis and the crown prince in particular, viewing them as critical partners for both security and business in a turbulent Middle East. The president said the Abraham Accords \u2014 an agreement from his first term that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel, Bahrain and the UAE\u00a0 \u2014 would be a big topic of discussion during the visit.",
      "\"The Abraham Accords will be a part we're going to be discussing,\" Mr. Trump said over the weekend. \"I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly. We've had tremendous interest in the Abraham Accords since we put Iran out of business.\"",
      "Mr. Trump recently told \"60 Minutes\" contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell that he thought bin Salman would join the agreement, although the Saudis have indicated that would not happen without a path to Palestinian statehood.",
      "The Trumps also have extensive and longheld personal business ties in Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.",
      "Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told Reuters that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "And Kushner started a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received a reported $2 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by bin Salman.",
      "Asked about the potential conflicts of interest given his family business ties, Mr. Trump insisted Tuesday,\"I have nothing to do with the family business.\"",
      "\"They've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually, I'm sure they could do a lot,\" Mr. Trump said of his family.",
      "Criticism of human rights record",
      "Following the killing of Khashoggi, Mr. Trump did not seek to punish bin Salman personally during his first administration and said he viewed Saudi Arabia as a \"great ally,\" noting the economic ties between the U.S. and the Saudis. The Trump administration did sanction 19 Saudi nationals over the killing.",
      "\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Mr. Trump posted on social media in November 2018.",
      "\"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\"",
      "Human rights advocates are dismayed about the treatment bin Salman is expected to receive in Washington, not only because of Khashoggi's murder, but also because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record under bin Salman.",
      "\"We know President Trump won't ask MBS to reveal where Jamal's remains are so his family can finally bury him,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now, an organization Khashoggi founded months before he was killed. \"But the least he can do \u2014 the absolute minimum \u2014 is publicly press MBS to release the dozens of activists, writers and reformers languishing in Saudi prisons for the 'crime' of speaking freely.\"",
      "Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director at DAWN, called bin Salman's journey from castigation over Khashoggi's murder to a high-profile White House welcome an \"extraordinary political feat.\" And that's not just because of Mr. Trump's gestures of friendship toward the crown prince. Whitson mentioned the \"fist bump seen around the world,\" as former President Joe Biden warmly greeted Khashoggi in Riyadh during his presidency \"hat in hand.\"",
      "\"We went from the Biden administration narrowly sanctioning Mohamamd bin Salman himself for the murder of Khashoggi \u2026 to now welcoming him into Washington and not only sort of feting him for whatever lucrative deals he can pass to American businesses, but also to potentially actually help as a stabilizing force,\" Whitson said.",

      "What to know about the Epstein files bill:",
      "The Senate approved a House-passed bill that would require the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, effectively sending it to President Trump's desk.The measure was formally transmitted to the Senate on Wednesday, the final step before heading to the president.

    "story": [
      "Former Treasury Secretary and Harvard President Larry Summers said Monday he will step back from \"public commitments\" after messages between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were released last week.",
      "\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement. \"While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.\"",
      "Dozens of messages between Summers and Epstein were included in a trove of documents from Epstein's estate that was released by the House Oversight Committee last week.",
      "The emails show Summers and Epstein communicated regularly during the last years of Epstein's life, even as the accused sex trafficker's public infamy and notoriety grew. Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "In one March 2019 exchange, the pair appeared to banter about a woman that Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer advice to the Harvard professor.",
      "\"I said what are you up to,\" Summers wrote in part of one message, describing a conversation with the woman. \"She said 'I'm busy.' I said awfully coy u are.\"",
      "Epstein's reply read, in part: \"shes smart. making you pay for past errors.\"",
      "In a separate conversation, Epstein appears to call himself Summers' \"wing man.\"",
      "There is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of Summers.",
      "It's not clear what public commitments Summers will call off. An economist by training, he has remained a professor at Harvard University since stepping down as the Ivy League school's president in 2006. He currently teaches two classes at the Harvard Kennedy School on globalization and U.S. economic policy, according to the school's course catalog.",
      "A former Treasury Secretary during the Clinton administration, Summers is an influential voice on economic policy. He advised former President Barack Obama during the financial crisis, and he publicly tangled with the Biden administration over its approach to post-COVID-19 economic stimulus.",
      "Epstein's ties with Harvard were well known. The late financier donated upward of $9 million to the university prior to his 2008 guilty plea in Florida, Harvard found in a 2020 investigation. The school said it didn't accept donations from Epstein after that, but he continued to engage with faculty and visit the school dozens of times.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Harvard said it is \"conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\"",
      "President Trump called on the Justice Department last week to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton and other high-profile Democrats. A spokesperson for former President Clinton said he wasn't aware of Epstein's actions and didn't do anything wrong.",
      "Mr. Trump's own relationship with Epstein has also drawn intense scrutiny. The two men traveled in the same Manhattan and Palm Beach social circles for a period of time, but Mr. Trump says he cut ties many years ago. The president hasn't been charged with a crime or been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Epstein regularly brought up Mr. Trump in the emails that were released last week. In one correspondence, Epstein said of the president, \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" referring to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing related to Epstein, and has called the controversy over it a \"hoax\" perpetuated by Democrats.",
      "The House and Senate\u00a0votied Tuesday on a bill that would order the Justice Department to release additional documents related to investigations of Epstein.",

      "NASA released close-up images on Wednesday of the rare interstellar comet that's making a single pass through the solar system.",
      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",

    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-birth-control-study-science/",
    "published": "Sat, 15 Nov 2025 07:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The study sought to answer questions about how breast cancer risk differs by type of hormonal contraceptive. Doctors say the results won't change how they counsel patients.",
    "story": [
      "As misinformation about women's health spreads faster than ever, doctors say new research on the risks of hormonal birth control underscores the challenge of communicating nuance in the social media age.",
      "The massive study, which was conducted in Sweden and tracked more than two million teenage girls and women under age 50 for more than a decade, found that hormonal contraception remains safe overall, but also found small differences in breast cancer risk based on the hormones used in the formulation. In addition, the researchers observed a small, short-term rise in breast cancer diagnoses among current or recent users. Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a 2017 Danish registry analysis and a 2023 meta-analysis.",
      "It was published online Oct. 30 in JAMA Oncology.",
      "Doctors say these study results won't change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.",
      "Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.",
      "Case in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24% higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn't. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year \u2014 about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.",
      "Co-authors \u00c5sa Johansson and Dr. Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.",
      "Rachel Fey \u2014 interim co-CEO of Power to Decide, a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods \u2014 said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media. \"I get really angry at this because it's designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,\" she said. \"It's really frustrating \u2026 especially when it's given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they're talking about providing that context.\"",
      "The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel \u2014 found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea \u2014 but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo\u2011Provera.",
      "How to interpret the findings",
      "Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumors, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.",
      "\"A substantial proportion of the 'cases' would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,\" said Lina S. M\u00f8rch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. M\u00f8rch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.",
      "The doctor-patient conversation",
      "Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasize that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: that hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman's needs and values.",
      "Dr. Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won't change how she talks to her patients.",
      "\"When counseling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what's important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),\" White wrote in an email. \"Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counseling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.\"",
      "Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.",
      "Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, \"For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,\" referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.",
      "Dr. Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn't change their advice yet.",
      "Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. \"It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,\" they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.",
      "Keeping the risk in perspective",
      "Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. M\u00f8rch noted that even small risks are worth discussing but said decisions should be guided by women's \"values and preferences.\"",
      "White said it's important to see the big picture. \"The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85% for people who do not use contraception\u2014so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,\" she wrote.",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

      "What is thought to be the world's largest-known spider's web, housing tens of thousands of arachnids, has been discovered in a cave on the Albanian-Greek border.",
      "After researchers published their findings of two different spider species peacefully cohabiting in a giant colony nestled in a pitch-black, sulfur-rich cave, evolutionary biologist Lena Grinsted likened the \"extremely rare\" occurrence to humans living in an apartment block.",
      "\"When I saw this study, I was very excited because \u2026 group living is really rare in spiders,\" Grinsted, a senior lecturer at the U.K.'s University of Portsmouth, told The Associated Press. \"The fact that there was this massive colony of spiders living in a place that nobody had really noticed before \u2014 I find extremely exciting.\"",
      "The results of the study, published last month in the journal Subterranean Biology, spread rapidly online due to the striking images of the giant 1,140-square-foot spider's web, a carpet-thick sprawl stretching along a narrow passage wall inside Sulfur Cave, which extends into Albania from its entrance in Greece.",
      "This arachnophobe's worst nightmare was quickly labelled the \"world's largest spiderweb.\"",
      "But the most surprising thing about the spider colony \u2014 which boasts an estimated 110,000 spiders \u2014 had less to do with its size and more to do with what scientists found inside the huge mass of funnel-shaped webs.",
      "Two different spider species \u2014 about 69,000 Tegenaria domestica, or common house spider, and 42,000 Prinerigone vagans \u2014 were living side by side and thriving. The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
      "\"So often if you have spiders in close vicinity, they will fight and end up eating each other,\" said Grinsted, who was not part of the cave study but has extensively researched spiders. \"We can sometimes see that if there's an abundance of food that they sort of become a bit less aggressive.\"",
      "In addition to spiders, the terrestrial fauna in the cave include centipedes, terrestrial isopods, scorpions and beetles, the researchers said.",
      "\"In the stream passage located close to the cave entrance, a dense swarm of adult chironomid flies fills the air in the immediate vicinity of the sulfidic stream, and a large portion of the cave wall is covered by a massive colonial spider web,\" the study's authors write.",
      "Abundant food source",
      "Scientists are keen to understand how and why the two species came to coexist peacefully in a \"permanently dark zone\" about 160 feet from the entrance of the cave, carved out by the waters of the Sarandaporo River to form the Vromoner Canyon. (The study's authors note that Vromoner means \"smelly water\" in Greek.)",
      "Part of the answer, the research suggests, may lie in the combination of the estimated 2.4 million midge flies that buzz around the spider colony \u2014 an \"unusually dense swarm\" that provides a constant food source in an otherwise predator-scarce environment. The scientists also speculate that the friendly living arrangement could be a result of darkness impairing the spiders' vision.",
      "However, Grinsted says it is more likely that the larger spiders evolved or simply grew accustomed to responding to vibratory cues when the small flies land on their silken web \u2014 and maybe don't attack otherwise.",
      "\"Spiders, in general, are not particularly good at seeing stuff ... and that includes these two species,\" she said. She added that the two species might cooperate \"to some extent in building the web \u2026 but I think it's highly unlikely that they cooperate in anything else like prey capture, in brood care, or looking after each other's babies.\"",
      "Grinsted draws parallels between the cohabiting spiders and how humans tend to coexist in apartment blocks.",
      "\"You're very happy to share the stairs, the lift,\" she said. \"But if anybody comes into your living room and you haven't invited them, you'll be aggressive towards them.\"",
      "She added that while many spiders are \"typically solitary, very aggressive\" toward other critters, the cohabitation of two species is \"relatively common\" once spiders have evolved the ability to live in groups.",
      "\"But again, because these two species have never been found to live together and never been found to live in groups, it makes it particularly exciting,\" she said.",
      "\"The web is dense \u2014 like a blanket\"",
      "Blerina Vrenozi, a biologist and zoologist at the University of Tirana, in Albania, who co-authored the research paper, told the AP that the expeditions this year helped understand \"how this mystery existed in there.\"",
      "\"The DNA is interesting because they revealed that the species which live inside the cave is different from the one which lives outside the cave,\" she said. \"So it's the same species, but different DNA.\"",
      "The cave colony's giant web was first observed in 2021 by a team of Czech speleologists led by Marek Audy. A year later, the Czech team expanded to include scientists from multiple universities, which led to the recently published scientific paper.",
      "\"The web is dense; it's more like a blanket, and when there's danger, the female crawls back and hides, and no creature of a higher order can dig her out of there,\" Audy said. \"Spiders in the cave lay about a third of the eggs compared to spiders that live outdoors. Because it's certain that they will raise their offspring there \u2026 so they can afford to lay fewer eggs.\"",
      "Audy added that the cave, which is also home to large bat colonies, also thrive on the abundance of midges inside the humid, dark space. \"They are constantly having a party there, both the spiders and the bats,\" he said.",
      "Seemingly ideal environment",
      "The study noted that the methodology used might \"slightly overestimate\" the total population count of spiders in the colony, as some funnel webs may be abandoned or unoccupied. However, other experts agree that the team's exciting new research could offer broader evolutionary clues and deserves deeper study.",
      "Sara Goodacre, professor of evolutionary biology and genetics at the School of Life Sciences, at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, says these kinds of research projects help pave the way for more studies that could prove \"fundamental to our understanding of what forces shape the world around us \u2014 spidery or not.\"",
      "\"Natural selection will favor the 'best' strategies \u2026 the 'winning strategy,' whatever this is,\" she said. \"My guess is that the benefits of being part of this community far outweigh the costs.\"",
      "She added that if the dynamics in the seemingly ideal environment of abundant food and relative safety were to change, \"then 'freeloading' will emerge and it will all break down.\"",
      "The politics of coexistence will hopefully not prove trickier above ground. Audy said that Albania has already asked which side the newly famous spiders lie.",
      "\"From a conservation point of view, we did something interesting there and marked out a border,\" he said. \"I just looked into it \u2014 and the spider web is on the Greek side.\"",
      "The discovery of the massive web comes just months after Australian scientists discovered a new species of the deadly funnel-web spider that is bigger and more venomous than its relatives, nicknaming it \"Big Boy.\"",

      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",

Her wife, previously identified as astronaut\u00a0Anne McClain, was at the ISS from December 2018 to June 2019. It was the first allegation of a crime being committed in space.",
      "An investigation by NASA's Office of the Inspector General found that Worden had opened the bank account in April 2018 and that both she and McClain had access to it until January 2019, the Justice Department said. The investigation also found that Worden had regularly given McClain access to her bank records, including login credentials, from at least 2015, the news release said.",
      "McClain said in 2019 that she had accessed the bank account with Worden's permission, The New York Times reported. Worden, a former Air Force intelligence officer, disputed that claim and filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. A complaint filed to NASA's Office of Inspector General by Worden's family accused McClain of identity theft and improper access.",

      "SpaceX launched a joint NASA-European environmental research satellite early Monday, the second in an ongoing billion-dollar project to measure long-term changes in sea level, a key indicator of climate change.",
      "The first satellite, known as Sentinel-6 and named in honor of NASA climate researcher Michael Freilich, was launched in November 2020. The latest spacecraft, Sentinel-6B, was launched from California atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 12:21 a.m. EST.",
      "Both satellites are equipped with a sophisticated cloud-penetrating radar. By timing how long it takes beams to bounce back from the ocean 830 miles below, the Sentinel-6 satellites can track sea levels to an accuracy of about one inch while also measuring wave height and wind speeds.",
      "The project builds on earlier missions dating back to the early 1990s that have provided an uninterrupted stream of sea level data.",
      "That data indicates sea levels are slowly but surely rising, widely interpreted as evidence of global warming caused in large part by human industrial activity.",
      "But in keeping with recent Trump administration policies aimed at scaling back climate research and the interpretation of such data, NASA did not directly refer to \"climate change\" or \"global warming\" in a Sentinel-6B pre-launch briefing Saturday.",
      "In the press kit released by NASA for the first Sentinel 6 mission in 2020, the first item in a \"need to know list\" said the satellite would \"provide information that will help researchers understand how climate change is reshaping Earth's coastlines \u2014 and how fast this is happening.\"",
      "In the press kit for the Sentinel 6B mission launched Monday, NASA's first \"need to know\" item said simply that \"Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multi-decade dataset that is ... key to helping improve public safety, city planning and protecting commercial and defense interests.\"",
      "Karen St. Germain, director of NASA's Earth Science Division, did not directly mention climate change in the Saturday briefing, focusing instead on the practical importance of monitoring sea levels.",
      "\"Sentinel 6B is the latest in a line of missions stretching over three decades, keeping an uninterrupted watch over our planet's sea surface height, finding patterns and advancing our understanding of planet Earth,\" she said.",
      "She said the data provided by the Sentinel-6 satellites \"underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping. These measurements form the basis for U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites and other assets along our shoreline.\"",
      "The data, she continued, will help scientists \"understand and predict coastal erosion and salt water encroachment into inland supplies of water that are used for agriculture, irrigation as well as municipal drinking water.\"",
      "Regardless of interpretation, the launch of Sentinel-6B went off without a hitch.",
      "After blasting off from launch complex 4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage powered the vehicle out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated and flew itself back to a landing pad at the California launch site.",
      "The upper stage then carried out two firings of its single engine before releasing the 2,600-pound Sentinel-6B into an 830-mile-high orbit tilted 66 degrees to the equator, the same orbit used by Sentinel-6A and earlier sea level-monitoring spacecraft.",
      "Taking 112 minutes to complete one orbit, the solar-powered satellite will fly over locations between 66 degrees north and south latitude, covering 90 percent of the world's oceans.",
      "Along with measuring sea levels, the new satellite will monitor temperature and humidity in the lower atmosphere as well as the higher-altitude stratosphere using an instrument that measures atmospheric effects on signals broadcast by navigation satellites.",
      "But the primary mission is monitoring Earth's changing sea levels.",
      "\"The dynamic balance that persisted before the industrial revolution has been upset by the almost instantaneous combustion of huge reserves of carbon as our society has developed,\" Craig Donlon, a European Space Agency project scientist, said before the first Sentinel-6 launch in 2020.",
      "\"We see evidence of this dramatic change in many different measurements ... but they all point the same direction: the Earth is warming. And the greatest indicator of this Earth system imbalance is sea level rise.\"",
      "The Sentinel-6 satellites are the result of a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",

Despite the promise of AI, most companies that are implementing AI have yet to see a measurable increase in productivity or profits, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Nvidia earnings are such an important event both because of the weighting that the stock has in the major equity indices and because it is ground zero for the entire Artificial Intelligence build out,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",

      "Customers will be able to browse Target's selection and make purchases within the ChatGPT app, according to the retailer. The tool will debut next week, providing access to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly active users in time for the holiday shopping season.",
      "Target is leaning on price cuts and a $1 billion investment plan to revive its brand, the retailer said separately Wednesday, as same-store sales fell 2.7% in the latest quarter and profit tumbled 19%. With shoppers increasingly relying on AI to find products online, other big retailers \u2014 including Walmart, which struck a similar partnership with OpenAI last month \u2014 are turning to the technology to boost sales.",
      "Here's how the ChatGPT-powered Target tool will work: Inside the ChatGPT app, consumers can tag Target and ask for ideas, such as if they're planning something like a holiday family movie night. The Target app will then suggest specific products, such as blankets or snacks, and allow users to buy them directly without leaving the ChatGPT interface.",
      "Target said that AI will eventually start to understand and predict what customers want to buy.",
      "A recent Harris Poll\u00a0shows that nearly half of Gen Z consumers would trust AI as a personal shopper that helps them pick out what they buy and find deals. Streamlining the purchasing process could help retailers boost sales, according to retail experts.",

    "summary": "Facing pressure from states and families, Roblox will require players to use AI-powered technology that helps verify their age.",
    "story": [
      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",

      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

    "summary": "State-sponsored cybercriminals used Anthropic's tech to target tech companies, financial institutions and other organizations, AI company alleges.",
    "story": [
      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",
      "Chris Krebs, the former head of the federal government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS Mornings on Friday that this attack is a sign of what's to come.",
      "\"As security experts, we've been talking about events and attacks like this for close to a decade,\" he said. To see an AI cyberattack come to life like this is \"pretty chilling,\" he added.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 06:21:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed changes include the elimination of the \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's administration moved Wednesday to roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live, reviving a suite of changes to Endangered Species Act regulations from the Republican's first term that were blocked under former Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "The proposed changes include the elimination of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened. Government agencies instead would have to craft species-specific rules for protections, a potentially lengthy process.",
      "The administration's announcement answers longstanding calls for revisions to the Endangered Species Act from Republicans in Congress and industries including oil and gas, mining and agriculture. The president has voiced frustration with the\u00a01973 law\u00a0and similar environmental protections, saying environmentalists are impeding growth. Critics argue the landmark 1973 environmental law has been wielded too broadly, to the detriment of economic growth.",
      "But environmentalists warned the changes could cause yearslong delays in efforts to save species such as the\u00a0monarch butterfly, Florida\u00a0manatee, California spotted owl\u00a0and North American wolverine.",
      "Scientists and government agencies say extinctions are accelerating globally because of habitat loss and other pressures.",
      "Trump has made oil and gas production a centerpiece of his presidency and sought to strip away environmental regulations that impede development. Other pending proposals from the administration would revise the definition of \"harm\"\u00a0under the Endangered Species Act and potentially bypass species protections for logging projects in national forests and on public lands.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement that the administration was restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent while respecting \"the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources.\"",
      "\"These revisions end years of legal confusion and regulatory overreach, delivering certainty to states, tribes, landowners and businesses while ensuring conservation efforts remain grounded in sound science and common sense,\" Burgum said in a statement.",
      "Another proposed change tasks officials with analyzing economic impacts when deciding whether habitat is critical to a species' survival.",
      "In April, a White House official confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump planned to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in the U.S. where endangered species live. The president\u00a0directed\u00a0agencies regulating energy and the environment to sunset a number of environmental protections, among other steps to curb environmental protections to spur construction and economic growth.",
      "Case of lizard shows potential outcome of proposals",
      "The case of the Yarrow's spiny lizard in the Southwest exemplifies the potential consequences of the proposals. Rapidly warming temperatures have ravaged a population of the lizard in Arizona's Mule Mountains, pushing the reptiles further up the mountainsides toward the highest peaks and possibly toward extinction.",
      "A petition filed Wednesday seeks protections for the lizard and the designation of critical habitat. Advocates say analyzing the economic impacts could delay protections. Designating critical habitat could be another hurdle because the primary threat to this population of spiny lizard is climate change.",
      "\"We think that the species should be listed as endangered. In fact, we are somewhat shocked that it is not already extinct,\" said John Wiens, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, who co-authored the petition.",
      "The Interior Department was sued over the blanket protection rule in March, by the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) and Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. The two groups argued the rule was illegal and discouraged states and landowners from assisting in species recovery efforts.",
      "Species designated as \"threatened\" under the rule automatically qualify for the same protections as those with the more severe designation of \"endangered.\"",
      "PERC Vice President Jonathan Wood said Wednesday's proposal was a \"necessary course correction.\"",
      "\"This reform acknowledges the blanket rule's unlawfulness and puts recovery back at the heart of the Endangered Species Act,\" Wood said.",
      "Proposals would undermine protections, critic says",
      "Kristen Boyles with the environmental law firm Earthjustice said the changes undermine protections even more than in Trump's first term. That includes allowing the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to not count negative effects on species if those impacts are not regulated by the agencies themselves, Boyles said.",
      "\"The Services are required to prevent harmful consequences to species, not ignore them,\" she said.",
      "Trump officials during his first term also rolled back protections for individual species including the northern spotted owl and gray wolf.",
      "The spotted owl decision was reversed in 2021 after officials said Trump's political appointees used faulty science to justify opening millions of acres of West Coast forest to potential logging. Protections for wolves across most of the U.S. were restored by a federal court in 2022.",
      "The Endangered Species Act protects more than 1,600 species in the United States and its territories. In the more than 50 years since the law was enacted, the\u00a0act has been credited with saving 99% of the listed species. Notable species saved include the bald eagle, American alligators, whooping cranes and peregrine falcons.",
      "CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2023 that since the passage of the law, more than 1,7000 plants, mammals, fish, insects and other species in the U.S. have been listed as threatened or endangered. But federal data shows that of the roughly $1.2 billion a year spent on endangered and threatened species, about half goes toward recovery of just two types of fish:\u00a0salmon\u00a0and steelhead trout along the West Coast.",
      "Last month, an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature said that arctic seals\u00a0are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of\u00a0bird species\u00a0around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion. One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said as it released its latest\u00a0Red List of Threatened Species.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is pushing to remove Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year.",
    "story": [
      "A top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is set to testify Thursday about the steps the Trump administration has taken to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the West African country of Liberia, as the Trump administration continues its push to remove him from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration urged U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to lift an August order that prevents Abrego Garcia from being deported to a third-party country without due process, arguing that the government has gone through all the necessary steps to remove Abrego Garcia.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has been a flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown since the Salvadoran immigrant was removed from where he lived in Maryland to his native country in March. He was sent to El Salvador even though in 2019, an immigration judge granted him a legal status known as withholding of removal because of concerns Abrego Garcia\u00a0 could be persecuted by gangs there.",
      "He faces deportation proceedings because he entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2011.",
      "In June, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. after he was detained in El Salvador's notorious mega-prison to face two felony charges of human smuggling. He has denied those charges.",
      "Before Abrego Garcia's criminal trial is scheduled to begin next year, the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. again, proposing to send him to several African countries, including Uganda, Eswatini and now, Liberia.",
      "The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, was interviewed in October by a U.S. government asylum officer, and that officer determined that he failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia. The Justice Department said any additional due process steps would be unwarranted.",
      "Abrego Garcia's \"claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event,\" the Justice Department said in its filing. \"This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia.\"",
      "In addition, the Justice Department submitted declarations from U.S. officials stating that Liberia has made \"sufficient and credible\" assurances that Abrego Garcia would not be harmed there or removed from Liberia to another country where he potentially could be persecuted.",
      "In a press release late last month, Liberia's government said it had agreed to receive Abrego Garcia on \"a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis,\" following a U.S. request.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his legal team have repeatedly challenged the government's attempts to deport him to African nations, claiming fear of persecution or torture. They have also argued that the Trump administration's repeated efforts to send Abrego Garcia to Africa is a form of retaliation, and Abrego Garcia should instead be sent to Costa Rica.",
      "They noted the government had offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica this summer, but only if he pleaded guilty to the federal human smuggling charges he faces in Tennessee.",
      "\"The timeline suggests a pattern: when the Government received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's civil case challenging his unlawful removal to El Salvador; it initiated a criminal prosecution in retaliation; and when it received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's criminal case, it initiated third-country removal efforts in retaliation,\" the attorneys said in a response to the Justice Department's motion.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have also asked Xinis to keep her block on his deportation in place \"unless and until an immigration judge concurs\" with the Trump administration's determinations.",

      "Seattle \u2014 Washington state's governor declared an emergency Wednesday to ensure enough jet fuel gets to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport after a leak shut down a major fuel pipeline.",
      "The order temporarily waives and suspends state regulations limiting the number of hours commercial vehicle operators can drive when transporting jet fuel, Gov. Bob Ferguson's office said in a news release. The proclamation ensures safe-driving measures are in place, the release said.",
      "\"This declaration will help the airport maintain its fuel supply while the pipeline is offline and limit disruptions to travelers,\" Ferguson is quoted as saying.",
      "The Olympic Pipeline was shut down on Nov. 11 because of a leak north of Seattle, between the cities of Everett and Snohomish. Operators notified the state of the leak and were working with state and federal agencies to contain, clean and repair it, the governor's office said.",
      "There was no estimate for when the pipeline would resume delivering fuel normally. But if it doesn't start back up by Saturday, the governor's office said airport operations would be \"significantly affected.\" The office didn't share details on what that impact would look like.",
      "The airport \"has limited fuel on hand to sustain operations,\" the governor's office said, and since last week, airport officials have told incoming flights to fuel up to capacity before arriving because of the pipeline shutdown. That practice, Ferguson's office notes, is known as \"ferrying fuel.\"",
      "The 400-mile-long Olympic Pipeline is operated by BP Pipelines North America, Inc. It carries gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum products from refineries in northwest Washington to points in Washington and Oregon.

The defendants in the case allegedly \"conspired to steal\" the money by sending it through multiple accounts.",
      "Some of that overpaid money was then used to help fund Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign to represent South Florida in the House, the Justice Department alleged.

      "\"Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain.

The ruling was issued by Brown and Judge David Guaderrama, nominated to the bench by President Trump and former President Barack Obama, respectively.

      "Smith, nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan in 1987, accused the two other judges of issuing the ruling without giving him enough time to respond, which he called an \"outrage.\" He wrote that in the days prior to the ruling, Brown sent him a pair of drafts that were more than 160 pages long, only offered a few days to react, and didn't wait for Smith to write his dissent.",
      "\"In my 37 years on the federal bench, this is the most outrageous conduct by a judge that I have ever encountered in a case in which I have been involved,\" Smith wrote.",
      "The dissent \u2014 which started by warning readers, \"Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night!\" \u2014 also attacked the opinion itself in often-harsh terms. He called Brown an \"unskilled magician,\" compared his reasoning to a \"bizarre multiple-choice question from hell,\" and called the ruling the \"most blatant exercise of judicial activism that I have ever witnessed.\"",
      "At one point, when discussing the court's decision to grant a preliminary injunction, Smith writes: \"If this were a law school exam, the opinion would deserve an 'F.'\"",
      "Race or politics?",
      "At the heart of Smith and Brown's disagreement is whether Texas lawmakers redrew the state's House districts for partisan reasons or racial reasons.",
      "The map-drawing effort began after Mr. Trump and his allies pushed Texas officials over the summer to create as many as five new GOP-leaning seats, as Republicans fight to hold onto a razor-thin House majority in next year's midterms.",
      "At one point during that gambit, Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, sent Texas Gov. Greg Abbott a letter alleging that a handful of the state's existing districts were illegal \"coalition\" districts where non-Hispanic White voters are in the minority but no single racial group has a majority.",
      "Tuesday's majority opinion, penned by Brown, said that Abbott \"explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race\" and \"repeatedly stated that his goal was to eliminate coalition districts and create new majority-Hispanic districts.\"",
      "The court concluded that the state's redistricting effort was unconstitutional because it was driven by racial considerations, not pure politics. It's legal for lawmakers to redraw maps for partisan reasons, Brown wrote, but racially gerrymandered maps can be challenged in court.",
      "Smith disagreed, pointing to evidence that he said shows the new Texas maps were actually driven mainly by partisan politics rather than race.",
      "The judge cited testimony from one of the mapmakers, Adam Kincaid, who explained at length why he made certain decisions to shift around the boundaries of congressional districts. Smith said Kincaid \"had a perfectly legitimate and candidly partisan explanation for his every decision.\"",
      "Smith also noted at one point that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who pushed to redraw his state's maps in response to Texas, \"took a victory lap\" after this week's ruling.",
      "\"That tells you all that you need to know\u2014this is about partisan politics, plain and simple,\" Smith said.",
      "In response Wednesday night, Newsom wrote on X: \"This judge says California's redistricting in response to Texas was overwhelmingly partisan. Yes, ours was. That was the ENTIRE POINT!\"",
      "Smith claimed the \"main winners from Judge Brown's opinion are George Soros and Gavin Newsom.\" He alleged Soros, the liberal megadonor, and his son, Alex Soros, \"have their hands all over this,\" claiming several lawyers and experts for the plaintiffs have links to groups that have received funding from the Soros family's Open Society Foundations.",
      "And Smith warned that, if the decision stands, it could disrupt next year's congressional races.",
      "\"As a legal and practical matter, Judge Brown's injunction turns the Texas electoral and political landscape upside down,\" he said. \"It creates mayhem, chaos, misinformation, and confusion.\"",
      "The League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the plaintiffs, said Smith's claim that the redistricting was purely political is \"flatly contradicted by the record.\" The group also rejected Smith's claim that the ruling would lead to \"chaos,\" saying the \"true risk would be allowing an unlawful, racially discriminatory map to stand.\"",
      "\"Protecting voters from racial discrimination is not activism; it is a constitutional obligation,\" LULAC CEO Juan Proa\u00f1o said. \"The majority acted responsibly to uphold the law and safeguard the rights of millions of Texans.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 21:46:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said Wednesday he has signed a bill that requires the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Wednesday he has signed a bill that requires the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days, after months of controversy that ended with the House and Senate passing the bill by nearly unanimous margins this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the bill-signing in a Truth Social post that lashed out at prominent Democrats with links to Epstein.",
      "\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" the president wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump endorsed the legislation over the weekend, after a handful of House Republicans joined with Democratic lawmakers and forced the House to hold a vote. The legislation passed the House 427-1 on Tuesday and moved through the Senate unanimously.",
      "Mr. Trump's support for the bill marks an about-face after the president had urged Republicans to avoid focusing on the Epstein issue for months, calling the push for more federal records on Epstein to be released a distraction tactic.",
      "Maria Farmer, who accused Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, of sexual abuse in the 1990s, said the bill-signing was a \"long time coming.\"",
      "\"I have waited nearly three decades for answers about how my reports of abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were investigated by federal authorities,\" she said in a statement. \"After being left in the dark for decades, having my repeated calls for transparency and action ignored, and living through nearly five administrations that turned a blind eye to this enormous travesty of justice, Congress finally listened to survivors.\"",
      "Farmer is currently suing the FBI, which she alleges ignored her initial sexual assault accusation. She said Wednesday that the bill's passage \"doesn't absolve the government and law enforcement's enormous failure to do its job the past 30 years.\"",
      "\"I hope to see the government make good on its promise of transparency and release the entirety of the files \u2013 not bits and pieces, not mass redactions but the complete truth, removing only child sexual abuse material and victim names and identifying information,\" she said.",
      "What will the Epstein files bill do?",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to make public all of the Justice Department and FBI's unclassified records, communications and investigative materials related to Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator, Maxwell.",
      "It's not clear what new documents will emerge, but Epstein and Maxwell were at the center of a series of federal investigations dating back nearly two decades. Tens of thousands of pages of records on their cases have been released by lawmakers in recent months, including files held by the government and Epstein's estate.",
      "Epstein was initially investigated by federal and local authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended with him controversially agreeing to plead guilty to state prostitution charges in exchange for avoiding a federal indictment. Then, in 2019, he was charged in New York federal court with sex trafficking of minors, but he died by suicide while in federal custody. Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking a year later and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "The case has drawn years of public fascination, including speculation and conspiracy theories spurred by Epstein's extensive ties to wealthy and powerful people. Democrats have criticized Mr. Trump for his yearslong friendship with Epstein, while Mr. Trump has scrutinized former President Bill Clinton for his relationship with the late financier. Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and representatives for Clinton say he was not aware of Epstein's crimes. Neither Mr. Trump nor Clinton has been accused of illegality or charged with a crime, and both have denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The Trump administration has faced calls from both sides to release more information on Epstein \u2014 and criticism from its own allies after some administration officials had promised further disclosures.",
      "In February, Bondi gave out binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" to a group of right-wing influencers, but she faced backlash after the influencers said much of the information was already public.",
      "Five months later, the Justice Department and FBI finished a review of the Epstein case and concluded that there was no incriminating \"client list,\" no evidence that he blackmailed prominent people and no evidence that would support an investigation into anybody else. The review also found that he died by suicide while awaiting trial in 2019. Some Trump supporters were dissatisfied and unconvinced by the findings.",
      "The push to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act was led by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie. Seeking to navigate around GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson's skepticism of the bill, the pair circulated a \"discharge petition,\" a procedural move that requires the House to vote on a bill if a majority of its members sign on.",
      "The petition drew support from four Republicans, including Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a onetime Trump ally who has increasingly broken with her party in recent weeks. Mr. Trump announced last week he was withdrawing his endorsement of Greene, which the Georgia lawmaker speculated was driven by the Epstein issue.",
      "For weeks, the petition sat at 217 signatures \u2014 one short of the number needed to force a vote \u2014 as newly elected Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva awaited her swearing-in ceremony after winning her seat in a September special election. Democrats accused Johnson of slow-walking Grijalva's swearing-in due to the Epstein bill, but Johnson said the delay was because the House remained out of session during the government shutdown.",
      "Grijalva signed the petition last week, forcing the House to hold a vote. Within days, Mr. Trump encouraged House Republicans to vote for the bill, leading it to pass easily on Tuesday.",

    "summary": "The Florida congressman has faced a number of controversies this year, ranging from alleged assault and harassment to stolen valor and federal contracting violations. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House blocked an effort to formally censure Republican Rep. Cory Mills of Florida and strip him of his committee assignments over allegations related to federal contracting violations, stolen valor and assault.",
      "GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced the censure resolution earlier Wednesday, citing troubling allegations against the congressman.",
      "She introduced the resolution as privileged, meaning GOP leadership had two legislative days to hold a floor vote on the measure. Mills successfully maneuvered to effectively kill the resolution by referring it to the House Ethics Committee.",
      "\"All the accusations and false things that are being said will be proven to be absolutely false in many ways,\" Mills said ahead of the vote. \"And I have the evidence and receipts.\"",
      "The vote came hours after the Ethics Committee announced it is investigating Mills for alleged campaign finance violations, sexual misconduct and other potential wrongdoing. Mace called the investigation \"a naked attempt to kill my resolution.\"",
      "Mills has faced a number of controversies this year, including allegations that he threatened to release nude photos of a former girlfriend, which prompted a judge to grant a protective order in October. The censure resolution also cites reports that Mills was investigated for potential domestic violence in February. Mills has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime.",
      "\"Cory Mills' alleged conduct makes him unfit to serve on any committee responsible for our national security,\" Mace said in a statement.",
      "\"I will not stand by while women risk everything to come forward with credible allegations of abuse and threats. I will not stay silent while a Member of Congress may be lining his pockets through federal contracts. And I will not look the other way while allegations of stolen valor, a slap in the face to every veteran who earned their service and sacrifice, goes unchecked,\" she said.",
      "The financial allegations revolve around a report by a congressional watchdog in August 2024 that found Mills may have misrepresented information on his campaign finance disclosure forms and may have \"entered into, held, or enjoyed contracts with federal agencies while he was a Member of Congress in violation of House rules, standards of conduct, and federal law.\"",
      "Mace's resolution also stated that \"individuals who served in the military with Representative Cory Mills have called into question the veracity of the account of events which formed the basis of a recommendation that ... Mills receive an award of a Bronze Star, bestowed in 2021, for his service under enemy fire in Iraq in 2003.\"",
      "In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson earlier Wednesday, Mace expressed \"grave concern regarding the fitness\" of Mills and urged the Louisiana Republican to take action to remove him from his committee assignments. Mills serves on the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "Mace's effort followed attempts from Democrats to formally rebuke him in retaliation for censure measures that GOP members brought against Democrats for their conduct.",
      "Democrats threatened to force a vote on another censure measure against Mills on Tuesday if Republicans had succeeded in censuring Del. Stacey Plaskett, a Democrat from the Virgin Islands. The push to punish Plaskett came after revelations that she was texting convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a House Oversight Committee hearing in 2019. The messages were released last week by the House Oversight Committee, which has made tens of thousands of documents public as part of its investigation into the Epstein case.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard on Wednesday offloaded a nearly 50,000-pound haul of cocaine worth more than $360 million, bringing it onshore at Port Everglades in southern Florida..",
      "\"It's the most cocaine ever seized by a single cutter in one deployment. So business is good,\" Adm. Nathan Moore, the commander of Coast Guard Atlantic Area, said in his first network interview.",
      "But despite recent U.S. air and missile strikes on what the Trump administration says is cartel smuggling infrastructure, the Coast Guard has not seen \"any noticeable difference\" in the flow of cocaine, Moore said.",
      "\"I would just tell you that the drugs you see here on [Cutter] Stone \u2014 most have been seized in September, October and even early in the month of November. So business is good for us and we are continuing to enjoy success\" in intercepting drug vessels.",
      "According to Moore, there have been no major changes in traffickers' routes or pace, or in drug purity. The U.S. military has conducted at least 21 strikes targeting alleged drug-ferrying boats off South America since September as part of a wider anti-drug offensive.",
      "But Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole says the strikes are having a measurable impact.",
      "\"You're starting to see the rise in the price of cocaine,\" Cole told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "\"Cocaine is getting more expensive. And I think what it is \u2014 not only more expensive in the U.S., but we're seeing it become more expensive at first stops. So more expensive in Puerto Rico, more expensive in the Dominican, more expensive once it lands in Guatemala and Honduras and Central America.\"",
      "Cole said the DEA has seen an increase in the price of cocaine of 30% to 45% per kilogram.",
      "\"It's now more expensive to recruit boat captains, it's more expensive to purchase engines, it's more expensive to build larger boats for transportation,\" he added. \"And this is all due to immense pressure.\"",
      "There has also been a recent surge in Coast Guard drug seizures, which Moore attributes to upgraded cutters like the Stone, as well as tighter integration with U.S. intelligence agencies and new autonomous surveillance tools.",
      "The strikes have come amid a broader buildup of U.S. military forces in the Caribbean as the Trump administration continues to put pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom the administration has repeatedly accused of being the head of a drug trafficking operation. President Trump on Monday said he would not rule out sending American troops to Venezuela.",
      "\"I don't rule out anything,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We just have to take care of Venezuela.\"",
      "Moore, who was recently nominated to become deputy commandant for operations of the U.S. Coast Guard, said traffickers are adapting, but not slowing down.",
      "\"It's a cat-and-mouse game,\" Moore said. \"We have success in one area, they shift tactics\u2026and then we shift to counter that.\"",
      "The Coast Guard previously announced multiple drug interceptions in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean this year, including what had been the previous record haul in August.",
      "Mr. Trump recently called maritime interceptions \"totally ineffective,\" but Moore Cole pushed back on that skepticism.",
      "Moore said the Coast Guard remains \"a tool in the nation's tool bag\" that delivers disproportionate impact when deployed against large, long-range cocaine shipments.",
      "\"We'll continue to keep immense pressure on every trafficking route,\" said Cole, adding, \"We're going to apply every single tool to stop the narcotics from coming into the United States and killing American citizens. And I think the strategy of an all-hands approach \u2014 the military, intel \u2014 it's making a difference.\"",
      "Cole also dismissed concerns that the strikes on alleged drug boats were weakening the U.S.'s relationship with some of its allies, including France, Mexico and Colombia, which threatened to cut off some intelligence sharing with the U.S. over the strikes.",
      "\"There's no shortage of intel sharing back and forth between countries, and neither country wants to see these problems that we're now seeing unfold in Mexico \u2014 with the fentanyl trade with China, with the precursor chemicals. None of these countries want those problems there,\" he said.",
      "Moore acknowledged that some drug-trafficking boats do not get caught, but said that the Coast Guard strategy \u2014 pushing operations far offshore \u2014 keeps much of the flow from ever reaching U.S. shores.",
      "Looking ahead, Moore said he expects next year to be even busier in terms of drug seizures.",
      "\"We don't see any indication that the business will slow down,\" Moore told CBS News. \"I think 2026 looks even better than 2025.\"",
      "Asked what he would say to Americans who feel like the boat strikes are ineffective at reducing the amount of drugs entering the U.S., Cole pointed to what he said was a 30% increase in drug seizures.",
      "In fiscal year 2025, the Coast Guard intercepted 231,000 kilograms of cocaine, the highest haul on record and more than triple the yearly average. Moore told CBS News he expects that number to grow in the future.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 21:05:13 -0500",
    "summary": "House lawmakers moved quickly to repeal a provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 over phone record seizures. It's unclear what the Senate will do.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House unanimously passed a bill Wednesday to repeal a\u00a0controversial provision\u00a0that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if federal investigators search their phone records without their knowledge.",
      "House leaders fast-tracked the bill under suspension of the rules, which requires a two-thirds majority for passage. The bill easily cleared the lower chamber in a 426 to 0 vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Tuesday that he wasn't sure how the upper chamber would approach the legislation, but he defended the provision allowing the lawsuits.",
      "\"The House isn't implicated in what we did. It just simply applies to the Senate,\" he said. \"There's a statute that obviously was violated and what this does is enables people who are harmed \u2014 in this case, United States senators \u2014 to have a private right of action against the weaponization by the Justice Department.\"",
      "The new law requires service providers to notify senators if their phone records or other data are seized or subpoenaed. A court cannot delay notification unless the senator is the target of a criminal investigation.",
      "The bill states: \"Any senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any federal department or agency.\"",
      "Senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation under the new law, which also limits how the government can rebut the claims. The law is retroactive to 2022, meaning it would allow at least eight senators to sue the federal government over their phone records being seized during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "The provision was tucked into a yearlong measure to fund the legislative branch, which passed Congress last week as part of a broader package to end the government shutdown. Thune told reporters Wednesday that he takes the fact that some lawmakers were unaware of the provision as a \"legitimate criticism in terms of the process.\"",
      "\"But I think on the substance, I believe that you need to have some sort of accountability and consequence for that kind of weaponization against a co-equal independent branch of the government,\" he added.",
      "As the package moved through the House Rules Committee last week, Democrats tried to amend the bill to remove the provision. Several Republicans on the committee expressed surprise and anger over the provision's inclusion, but said they had to support the overall package to reopen the government because removing it would prolong the shutdown by sending the amended bill back to the Senate.",
      "\"What they did is wrong,\" GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia said last week. \"There's actually a list of people that know they will get paid as soon as this thing is signed \u2014 at least they've got the coupon where all they have to do is go file at the courthouse to get paid.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas called the provision \"self-serving\" and criticized its last-minute insertion into the bill without any debate.",
      "\"It is beside my comprehension that this got put in the bill, and it's why people have such a low opinion of this town,\" Roy said.",
      "Citing the provision, Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, refused to vote for the funding package to reopen the government.",
      "After a conversation with Thune last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the South Dakota Republican \"regretted the way it was done.\" Johnson said the Senate's move was \"way out of line.\"",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said he did not ask Thune to commit to holding a vote in the Senate, but he expected the chamber to do so.",

      "The newly released material from 2017 shows a series of text messages between Epstein and an apparent adviser to Gates, discussing the tech baron and other attendees at an annual banquet in Washington.",
      "Epstein had been hoping to sell Gates on a donor-advised fund, a tax-deductible charitable vehicle Epstein wanted to operate, but that never ultimately materialized.",
      "Gates was interested in the idea, the adviser said, but for the misgivings of one person who didn't want him communicating with Epstein: Gates' then-wife Melinda.",
      "\"He wants to talk to you but his wife won't let him,\" the adviser said. In a series of texts a minute later, the adviser said of Gates, \"he loves you,\" \"he says hi,\" and \"he feels bad about the [donor advised fund] btw He thought great idea but wife wouldn't allow.\"",
      "Later in the day, Epstein suggested to the same person that former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler \"would love to sit with Melinda and give her the other side of Jeffrey.\" A source tells CBS News that meeting never took place.",
      "CBS News previously reported that Ruemmler, who is currently the chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs, was among Epstein's inner circle in the final years of his life. Ruemmler has described it as a business relationship; she is not accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Requests for comment sent to Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates were not immediately returned. The couple divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.",

      "Epstein's appointment calendar, released by Congress in September, shows several meetings with Gates, who previously said he had met with Epstein while seeking contributions and connections for his global health philanthropy.",
      "Gates is among a slew of famous and powerful people who have long sought to publicly downplay their connections to Jeffrey Epstein. In some cases, documents have come to light showing they in fact had more involved relationships than they've acknowledged.",
      "Epstein was a prolific networker who sought to build relationships with world leaders, business titans and celebrities, often casting himself as a middleman who could connect the powerful.",
      "His ability to build an elite social circle continued even after he had become a registered sex offender,\u00a0 following a 2008 deal with prosecutors in Florida that allowed Epstein to plead guilty to lesser state charges. He then was able to return to his globetrotting life.",
      "As cache after cache of Epstein's personal communications, flight logs and calendars have come out, many of his friends and acquaintances have faced blowback.

      "Washington \u2014 The House on Wednesday formally sent to the Senate a bill that would force the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the final procedural move before the legislation can be sent to President Trump for his signature.",
      "After the House passed the measure in a 427-1 vote on Tuesday, the Senate approved the bill unanimously before it could even be formally transmitted from the lower chamber. With the transmission of the bill Wednesday morning, the bill is formally considered passed, and now heads to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "Mr. Trump, who had initially expressed opposition to the release of the files, is expected to sign the measure into law, after he changed his tune Sunday and urged Republicans to vote in favor of the bill.",
      "With his signature, the Justice Department, FBI and U.S. attorney's offices would be forced to release their files related to Epstein, his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell and other entities connected to them within 30 days. Survivors' personal information and other sensitive material can be withheld or redacted with explanations to Congress.",
      "A long path to passage",
      "The final hurdles for the bill come months after the effort began. After the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures in July, interest in the files has swelled, sparking widespread calls for greater transparency from the Trump administration.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July that would require the Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days. And when Congress returned from recess in September, Massie filed a discharge petition to force a vote on the bill, circumventing GOP leadership. The petition, which required 218 signatures, picked up support from all Democrats and four Republicans, but the final signature needed remained out of reach as Rep. Adelita Grijalva's swearing in was delayed during the government shutdown.",
      "Meanwhile, Republican leaders had pushed back on the discharge petition and underlying legislation, warning against the possible release of sensitive information while touting work from congressional committees to look into the Epstein files. But public pressure on lawmakers to force the release of the documents remained high.",
      "Last week, Grijalva was sworn in and became the final signature needed on the discharge petition and force a vote. On Wednesday, after Mr. Trump gave his blessing, the House voted almost unanimously in favor of the measure.",
      "The Senate quickly followed suit, unanimously agreeing to deem the bill passed once it arrived from the House.",
      "A GOP split",
      "The effort, and the Epstein issue more broadly, often divided Republicans, who faced conflicting pressure from constituents and the administration.",
      "Last week, the president lashed out at Republicans who pushed to release the files, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a long-time supporter. Mr. Trump reversed his endorsement of Greene, calling her a \"traitor,\" after she called his prior opposition to releasing the files a \"huge miscalculation.\"",
      "As the bill approached passage on Tuesday, Khanna spoke of the \"extraordinary political consequences\" suffered by Massie and Greene, along with other Republicans who supported the measure. And Greene lamented that the fight over the disclosure of the Epstein files had \"ripped MAGA apart.\"",
      "The issue also seemed to divide GOP leaders. Johnson led the charge against it in Congress. On Tuesday, even as he expressed concerns about the bill, the speaker voted to move it forward, saying that he expected the Senate to amend it and insisting that Senate Majority Leader John Thune do so. Thune did not, and the bill sailed through the Senate unanimously.",
      "Thune acknowledged Johnson's concerns to reporters ahead of the vote, saying, \"I think there are some things he'd like to change, but you got a 427 to 1 vote, it's probably not likely to happen.\" Johnson told reporters afterward, when asked whether he was frustrated with Thune, that \"I'm frustrated with the process, but I trust Leader Thune.\"",

    "summary": "A judge repeatedly questioned prosecutors about the validity of the indictment returned by a grand jury and its handling by interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department's criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey appears to be on shaky ground as a judge Wednesday repeatedly questioned federal prosecutors about the validity of the indictment returned by a grand jury and how it was handled by interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan.",
      "During a hearing on Comey's bid to have the charges tossed on the grounds his prosecution is vindictive and selective, U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff pressed government lawyers for clarity about the events that surrounded the grand jury proceedings on Sept. 25, when it voted to indict Comey on two counts related to testimony he provided to Congress in September 2020. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Halligan had said in a declaration filed with the federal court in Alexandria on Friday that after she made her presentation to the grand jury, it deliberated for roughly two hours. Halligan said she was then informed by her deputy that the grand jury had rejected one count, but voted to indict Comey on two others.",
      "The indictment was then re-drafted to remove the first count, and listed only the two counts that the grand jury approved, Tyler Lemons, a federal prosecutor working on Comey's case, told Nachmanoff on Wednesday. Lemons said a grand-jury coordinator told prosecutors about the outcome of the vote.",
      "Judge has questions about second indictment",
      "But Nachmanoff questioned whether the second indictment \u2014 with only the two charges \u2014 had been presented to the grand jury and voted on, or given straight to a U.S. magistrate judge. That judge, Lindsey Vaala, presided over the return of the indictment and also expressed confusion as to why she was presented with two documents: The indictment with two counts, and a report of the grand jury's failure to concur in an indictment, which lists three counts.",
      "Lemons said the second indictment was given straight to the judge, and argued it was not a \"new\" indictment, but had been edited only to reflect the grand jury's decision to charge Comey with lying to Congress and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.",
      "Nachmanoff pressed Lemons further, asking if the second indictment was never shown to the entire grand jury. The prosecutor said that was correct. Lemons was not at the proceedings before the grand jury in September. Halligan presented the case by herself.",
      "While Lemons answered most of the judge's questions, Halligan briefly appeared before Nachmanoff to tell him that only the foreperson and another grand juror were in the courtroom when the indictment was presented to the magistrate judge.",
      "One of Comey's attorneys, Michael Dreeben, said moments later that the Justice Department had just acknowledged the indictment was never presented to the grand jury and never returned.",
      "\"There is no indictment that Mr. Comey is facing,\" Dreeben said, adding this is a \"threshold basis\" to dismiss the case with prejudice, which would prohibit prosecutors from re-filing charges. He said there should be no charges against his client because the five-year statute of limitations for Comey's alleged offenses has now expired.",
      "Halligan's presentation before the grand jury and her handling of the indictments have puzzled not only Nachmanoff, but two other judges that have presided over different aspects of Comey's criminal case, which remains in its early stages.",
      "A Justice Department official told CBS News Wednesday evening in a statement that \"the Government remains committed to following the law, respecting grand-jury secrecy, and ensuring that judicial decisions rest on facts\u2014not assumptions. The magistrate judge's order does not meet that standard.\"",
      "Earlier hearing raises questions about transcript of Halligan's grand jury presentation",
      "During a hearing last week on a separate legal issue involving Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney, U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie raised what she said was a missing portion of the transcript from the grand jury proceedings.",
      "The judge said it appeared no court reporter was present during part of Halligan's presentation, or did not transcribe the period at issue. Halligan later said in her declaration Friday that the missing portion reflects the time when the grand jury was deliberating, which must be done without any other person in the room, including a court reporter.",
      "\"There are no missing minutes, contrary to the suggestion raised by the court,\" Halligan wrote.",
      "Another judge raises questions about grand jury transcript",
      "But then, on Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick raised his own issues with the \"completeness\" of the transcript and the manner in which the second indictment was presented to the grand jury.",
      "Fitzpatrick said the second indictment was new, and he concluded after reviewing the grand-jury transcript that Halligan would've presented it to the grand jury for consideration before it was returned in open court.",
      "\"It now appears that may not have happened,\" he wrote.",
      "Citing the timeline that Halligan laid out in her filing, the judge said the short time span between when she learned that the grand jury rejected one count in the initial indictment and when she appeared in court to return the second indictment \u2014 which is about seven minutes \u2014 \"could not have been sufficient\" to draft and sign the second document, present it to the grand jury, provide legal instructions and give them a chance to deliberate and render a decision.",
      "\"If the prosecutor is mistaken about the time she received notification of the grand jury's vote on the original indictment, and this procedure did take place, then the transcript and audio recording provided to the Court are incomplete,\" Fitzpatrick wrote in an order. \"If this procedure did not take place, then the Court is in uncharted legal territory in that the indictment returned in open court was not the same charging document presented to and deliberated upon by the grand jury.\"",
      "He ordered federal prosecutors to turn over all grand jury material to Comey's defense team, and criticized the Justice Department for what he described as a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in its handling of the case.",
      "Fitzpatrick wrote that there is \"the prospect that government misconduct may have tainted the grand jury proceedings.\"",
      "The Justice Department official told CBS News Wednesday that \"the grand jury transcript \u2014 which Magistrate Judge Fitzpatrick read \u2014 speaks for itself. When read in full, it shows no misstatement of law, no improper instruction, and no basis for the extraordinary remedy of breaching grand-jury secrecy. Partial snippets cannot overcome the actual record.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/affordability-2025-inflation-food-prices-housing-child-care-health-costs/",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 17:27:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Although inflation has eased, many Americans say they still feel squeezed financially. Here are five areas where households are feeling the pinch.",
    "story": [
      "Although inflation across the U.S. is far cooler than in the post-pandemic years, millions of Americans say they still feel the pinch of rising prices, struggle to pay the bills and express concern about their financial prospects.",
      "Price increases are nowhere near the level reached in June of 2022, when the Consumer Price Index hit a 40-year high of 9.1%. Yet many people feel squeezed by the cost of simple daily necessities, including the ability to afford healthy food, and by long-term increases in the cost of essentials such as housing and health care.",
      "This affordability crisis is rooted in a combination of both longstanding economic issues dating back decades and more recent developments. For instance, housing costs have surged partly due to a lack of available homes, a result of cutbacks in construction following the Great Recession, while more recently steep new U.S. tariffs have fueled inflation.",
      "Inflation and the economy now rank as Americans' top national concerns, according to an October CBS News poll.",
      "\"Everything is going up in price very quickly,\" said Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Lawrence, Kansas.",
      "With his family's monthly health care premiums set to rise 18% to $2,600 next year, he's planning to cut back in other areas. \"Our food budget is going to go down \u2014 we're not talking about eating beans and rice, but going from a comfortable middle-class lifestyle to eating how we did when we first got out of college,\" Tolbert said.",
      "Here are five key categories of spending that many Americans are struggling to afford.",
      "Food",
      "Almost half of Americans say it's harder to afford groceries today than it was a year ago, according to a September survey\u00a0by Axios and the Harris Poll. Only 19% said food prices are cheaper than a year earlier, with roughly a third seeing no change.",
      "Growth in food prices has eased considerably, although it is still rising, with the latest CPI report showing grocery prices rose 2.7% in September on an annual basis, a sharp contrast to the\u00a011.4% increase in 2022. Overall, however, food prices as of September were more than 18% higher than in January of 2022, according to the CBS News price tracker.",
      "Shoppers don't assess food costs the same way economists do. They focus on their day-to-day spending \u2014 which keeps climbing \u2014 and compare their out-of-pocket spending today with what they paid several years ago,\u00a0according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "In other words, people's experience of inflation and how they measure it in their daily lives may not mesh with official economic measures that paint a more optimistic picture.",
      "Meanwhile, other recent signals underscore the difficulty many Americans have simply putting food on the table. Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to data from Purdue University's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "In New York City, for example, 40% of local families can't afford their weekly food costs, according to new data from charitable organization Robin Hood and Columbia University.",
      "Housing",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "The data backs that up, with a homebuyer today needing to earn $121,400 a year to afford a typical home, meaning that their monthly costs would remain below 30% of their annual income, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The average American earns about $84,000 a year, highlighting the considerable gap between incomes and home prices.",
      "Several forces have pushed housing costs higher. The rate of home construction plunged after the 2008-09 financial crisis, leading to a shortfall in housing inventory. Meeting today's demand for housing would require building as many as 4 million additional homes beyond current construction levels, Goldman Sachs estimates.",
      "The low interest rates that prevailed during the pandemic, when homebuyers could secure mortgages below 3%, sparked a buying rush that sent prices soaring. Even with a slight cooling this year, homes are selling for about 25% above their 2019 levels, while mortgage rates have more than doubled since their pandemic lows.",
      "Child care",
      "The challenge of affording child care is another pain point for many families. In 2024, the average annual cost of care for one child around the U.S. topped $13,000, up 30% from 2020, according to Child Care Aware America, a nonprofit group.",
      "Families with a single child can end up paying between roughly 9% and 16% of their median income on full-time day care,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Labor. That means parents are often spending more on child care than they do on other expenses, such as groceries or even rent, data shows.",
      "Gina Monroe, a 42-year-old mom based in Massapequa, New York, said the financial strain of child care has made her and her husband think twice about having another child. She started sending her 2-year-old son to day care in September and pays around $450 a week.",
      "\"Nothing's getting any cheaper,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Child care costs have surged partly because there aren't enough early education workers to support the number of children who need care, according to experts. The industry also pays meager wages, adding to the challenges of recruiting new workers, said Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families.",
      "Health care",
      "Americans are also getting socked by rising health care costs, ranging from higher insurance premiums to out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-pays. The increase in medical costs stems largely from the emergence of more expensive treatments, such as the popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs, as well as an aging population that requires more care, according to consulting firm Mercer.",
      "The cost of health care was at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, with Democratic lawmakers pushing to extend a tax credit to defray the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The shutdown ended without an agreement to extend the subsidies, which means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums rise from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "Employees who get their insurance through employer-based plans are likely to see their health care costs rise as much as 7% for their 2026 plans, according to Mercer.",
      "Electricity and utility costs",
      "Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utility costs, up 12% since last year, according to a new\u00a0report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.",
      "The surge stems from a succession of rate hikes across the U.S, as electricity demand outstrips supply. In 2025 alone, more than 124 million Americans are expected to see some sort of rate increase in their energy bill, a recent PowerLines\u00a0report\u00a0found.",
      "Even if you do your best to shut off every light, some fixed costs are unavoidable, such as the so-called \"delivery charge,\" or what a utility charges to send electricity from a power plant to a home, said Rodrigues of the National Parents Union.",
      "The energy burden falls most acutely on low- and middle-income families, who spend between 6% and 10% of their income on energy, or three to five times that of higher-income households, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.",
      "Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Alain  Sherter",

    "summary": "It is unclear whether the killing of \"King of the Hill\" voice actor Jonathan Joss will be considered a hate crime.",
    "story": [
      "A grand jury in Texas has indicted the man accused of killing \"King of the Hill\" voice actor\u00a0Jonathan Joss\u00a0on a murder charge.",
      "But it is unclear whether Joss' killing will be considered a hate crime. Police in San Antonio did not immediately return an email seeking comment Wednesday on whether its investigation had determined that Joss'\u00a0sexual orientation\u00a0played a role in his shooting, and the Bexar County District Attorney's Office declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Police allege Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, 57, confronted Joss and his husband on June 1 as they were checking their mail at their San Antonio home, which had been burned down in January.",
      "Joss' husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, has claimed the person who killed the actor yelled \"violent homophobic slurs\" before opening fire.",
      "Ceja Alvarez allegedly confessed to officers, saying \"I shot him\" as he was being detained, according to a police report obtained by\u00a0CBS affiliate KENS-TV. His attorneys did not immediately return emails seeking comment Wednesday.",
      "In June, Alfonso Otero, one of Ceja Alvarez's attorneys, said his client was innocent and denied making any homophobic statements.",
      "The grand jury returned the indictment Monday, and Ceja Alvarez remains free on a $200,000 bond.",
      "A friend of the 59-year-old Joss has said that Joss and Ceja Alvarez were neighbors and the two had argued for years.\u00a0Neighbors told KENS-TV that the two men had previously faced off armed with weapons, but said the confrontations hadn't turned violent until the shooting.",
      "Initially, San Antonio police had said there was no evidence indicating the shooting was related to Joss' sexual orientation. But San Antonio Police Chief William McManus later walked back that statement, saying it had been \"premature\" and that whether Joss' sexual orientation played a role in the shooting was \"part of the investigation.\"",
      "The district attorney's office said in a statement Wednesday that Ceja Alvarez \"is charged with murder, which is the most serious charge applicable to this crime under Texas law. As the case is still pending, no additional details or information can be released at this time.\"",
      "Under Texas law, a hate crime \u2014 if there's a conviction \u2014 would be handled as an enhancement during sentencing and not as a separate charge.",
      "Joss was the voice of John Redcorn, a Native American character on the popular \"King of the Hill\" animated series, which ran for 13 seasons from 1997 to 2008. A reboot of the show, which Joss had already worked on, premiered in August.",
      "Joss also had a recurring role on the television show \"Parks and Recreation,\" playing Chief Ken Hotate. He appeared in two episodes of the series \"Tulsa King\" in 2022.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-comey-indictment-vindictive-selective-prosecution/",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:11:02 -0500",
    "summary": "In court Wednesday, former FBI Director James Comey sought to have the criminal charges against him dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "The federal judge overseeing the criminal case of former FBI Director James Comey questioned the Justice Department in a contentious hearing Wednesday about the leadup to his indictment and whether or not the grand jury was presented with the final version.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff is considering Comey's effort to have the two-count federal indictment against him dismissed on the grounds that it is based on a \"vindictive and selective\" prosecution.",
      "The government sought to defend its indictment, but was peppered with questions from Nachmanoff about whether there had been a declination memo written by federal prosecutors who had overseen the investigation into Comey before Lindsey Halligan took over as interim U.S. attorney. Such a memo would outline the reasons not to pursue a prosecution.",
      "Tyler Lemons, arguing for the Justice Department, said there was \"written correspondence of whether to pursue charges\" but also said that any he had been directed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's office to not answer \u2014 because some material could be privileged, and a decision to waive that privilege has not been made.",
      "Lemons did tell the court, however, that a prosecution memo had been prepared.",
      "Nachmanoff also questioned Lemons about whether the correct indictment of Comey was ever actually presented to the full grand jury for a vote. He asked Lemons about the timing of the presentation and the two different indictments that emerged in the case. Nachmanoff suggested the record shows that Halligan took the three-count indictment \u2014 which contained one count that was rejected \u2014 and merely made \"edits to reflect the vote of the grand jury as to the two counts,\" as Lemons put it, without presenting the updated version to the grand jury. Lemons acknowledged the updated indictment that reflected the two charges was not shown to the grand jury.",
      "The hearing was the second in two weeks stemming from Comey's bids to dismiss the criminal charges, which stem from testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee more than five years ago. Comey has pleaded not guilty to both charges and has argued that the prosecution is a result of Mr. Trump's efforts to target a political foe.",
      "During arguments on Wednesday, one of Comey's attorneys, Michael Dreeben, said that the Justice Department's prosecution of his client is part of President Trump's effort to \"punish and deter\" those who speak out against him, citing a \"pattern\" of Comey speaking out against Mr. Trump and in turn, the president attacking him. Dreeben said that pattern began after the president fired Comey from his role leading the FBI in 2017.",
      "\"The government cannot use the power of prosecution in an attempt to silence a critic,\" he said.",
      "Comey's lawyer pointed to a social media post from Mr. Trump on Sept. 20 in which he appeared to direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey as well as two other Democrats, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff.",
      "Dreeben said the post is an \"admission this is a political prosecution.\" Mr. Trump, he said, effectively substituted himself for the U.S. attorney as the decision maker in prosecuting Comey.",
      "Comey's legal team is asking the court to dismiss the indictment with prejudice, so prosecutors cannot re-file charges. Dreeben said that remedy is needed because of the stakes of the case.",
      "The nation has never before seen a \"blatant use of criminal justice to achieve political ends,\" he said.",
      "Defendants must clear a high bar in order to win the dismissal of an indictment on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive and selective.",
      "For vindictive prosecution, the defendant must show that the prosecutor acted with \"genuine animus\" toward him, and that prosecutor pursued charges to punish the defendant for exercising a protected right.",
      "In a claim of selective prosecution, the defendant must show that the government was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, either by demonstrating that similarly situated individuals were spared from prosecution or that the decision to bring charges was \"invidious or in bad faith.\"",
      "Comey's lawyers have argued in filings that direct evidence establishes that Mr. Trump harbors \"genuine animus\" toward Comey based on his protected speech and the president's \"arbitrary personal bias.\" The former FBI chief has repeatedly spoken out against Mr. Trump's conduct in office and in response, the president has \"resorted to personal attacks and calls to retaliate against Mr. Comey through punishment and imprisonment,\" defense lawyers wrote.",
      "To demonstrate the breadth of Mr. Trump's dislike of Comey, his lawyers provided the court with nearly 60 pages of social media posts from the president dating back to May 2017 in which he attacks and accuses the former FBI director of wrongdoing.",
      "\"As a private citizen, Mr. Comey has vigorously and prominently exercised his First Amendment right to criticize President Trump. In response, President Trump has repeatedly attacked and threatened Mr. Comey,\" Comey's lawyers wrote. \"That pattern began soon after Mr. Comey's May 2017 termination as FBI Director and has continued up until \u2014 and even after \u2014 the indictment in this case.\"",
      "Defense lawyers also highlighted the timing of Comey's indictment \u2014 sought days before the five-year statute of limitations expired \u2014 and the fact that it was pursued only after the president installed his former personal defense lawyer and White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who did not have any prosecutorial experience before being tapped to lead the Virginia prosecutors' office. She replaced Erik Siebert in the role, whose abrupt departure came amid concerns he would be removed for failing to bring a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, another critic of the president.",
      "\"With the statute-of-limitations deadline looming and no career prosecutor \u2014 not even President Trump's own interim U.S. Attorney (Mr. Siebert) \u2014 willing to seek the indictment, the President took matters into his own hands by directing his Attorney General to seek 'JUSTICE' against Mr. Comey and to unlawfully appoint a White House aide who would prosecute this case. She then immediately did so,\" they wrote in court filings.",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Nachmanoff asked Comey's legal team if Halligan was a \"puppet\" and \"stalking horse\" who was taking orders from the White House.",
      "\"She did what she was told to do,\" Dreeben said.",
      "In defense of Comey's indictment and Halligan's conduct, Lemons argued that it was \"her decision and her decision only\" to seek an indictment of the former FBI director. He added there was \"no proof\" anyone at the White House or Justice Department spoke to Halligan ahead of the indictment being presented to the grand jury.",
      "\"Ms. Halligan was not directed to pursue this prosecution,\" Lemons said, adding she was \"not a puppet.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyers responded by arguing in court filings that Comey \"weaves a tale\" through \"news reports, social media posts, and speculation\" that does not meet the \"rigorous legal standard\" to dismiss the case.",
      "They argued that numerous high-ranking government officials have been prosecuted for lying to Congress about official actions. The department also argued that Comey has not alleged that Halligan, who sought the indictment, harbored animus against Comey, and there is no evidence that Mr. Trump displaced her as the decision-maker in bringing the prosecution.",
      "\"The true affront to the criminal justice system would be to allow the defendant to escape accountability for lying to and obstructing Congress under oath about actions he took while serving as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" prosecutors wrote. \"The indictment was presented by a duly appointed and unbiased prosecutor. And a duly constituted grand jury found probable cause that he committed the indicted offenses.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyers also pointed to Mr. Trump's years of social media posts about Comey, but said they show the president's view that Comey committed a crime preceded the former FBI director's public criticism of the president.",
      "They said Comey was prosecuted because of his \"extraordinary conduct\" and \"flagrant violation\" of the public's trust by allegedly lying to Congress.",
      "\"The Executive cannot be expected to ignore agency heads lying about official actions simply because they later become outspoken critics,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Comey's motion claiming selective and vindictive prosecution is one of several pursued by his defense team that aim to have the charges dismissed before the start of a trial.",
      "As proceedings have moved forward in the weeks since his indictment in late September, prosecutors have run into issues that could doom their case.",
      "On Monday, a federal magistrate judge took what he called the \"extraordinary remedy\" of ordering federal prosecutors to turn over all grand jury materials to Comey's defense team, citing a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in the case, including potential issues with how the Justice Department handled evidence used in the grand jury presentation and how Halligan conducted herself in front of the grand jury.",
      "Nachmanoff, has temporarily paused that order while the Justice Department appeals it.",
      "Comey's legal team also argued alongside New York Attorney General Letitia James' legal team last week that the indictments against them should be dismissed because Halligan's appointment was unlawful. James was indicted last month on federal mortgage fraud charges and has pleaded not guilty. The federal judge who heard arguments on that issue said she would have a ruling on the validity of Halligan's appointment by Thanksgiving.",

    "summary": "President Trump said the U.S. is getting involved in peace efforts in Sudan at the request of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the U.S. is getting involved in efforts to strike peace in Sudan amid an ongoing civil war there, at the request of his \"very good friend\" Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump made the announcement Wednesday as he spoke at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, one day after a lengthy meeting with the crown prince, known as MBS, in the Oval Office. The State Department has already said the U.S. has been working with international partners, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, to broker an end to the war, but the president said he views the situation \"differently now than I did just a day ago.\"",
      "The people of Sudan are suffering from a staggering humanitarian crisis, as the two-and-a-half-year war takes its toll. The power struggle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, has displaced millions, sparked famine and led to claims of genocide. Mr. Trump said he wasn't planning to get involved in the yearslong conflict in Sudan, but the crown prince suggested he add Sudan to his list of peace deals he has helped broker. The United Nations says what's happening in Sudan is the greatest humanitarian crisis on Earth.",
      "\"His majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan,\" Mr. Trump told his audience at the U.S.-Saudi business forum. \"It was not on my charts to be involved in that. ... But I just see how important that is to you and to a lot of your friends in the room, Sudan, and we're going to start working on Sudan.\"",
      "The president's announcement was met with great applause in the room. Mr. Trump said his administration got started on working for peace in Sudan about half an hour after his meeting with MBS concluded Tuesday.",
      "\"And you know we've already started working on that, OK?\" he said.",
      "Earlier this month, a State Department spokesperson told reporters the Trump administration was engaging directly with the RSF and the Sudanese army, and called on both sides to \"move forward in response to the U.S.-led effort to conclude a humanitarian truce, given the immediate urgency of de-escalating the violence and ending the suffering of the Sudanese people.\"",
      "But the president's push for action draws more focus to the region, while spotlighting MBS' influence. Mr. Trump has emphasized his excellent relationship with MBS, as well as the \"great wealth\" the Saudis are pouring into the U.S.",
      "MBS announced Tuesday in the Oval Office that a planned $600 billion investment in the U.S. from Saudi entities would be closer to $1 trillion. The two leaders also signed what the president called a \"historic\" and \"strategic\" defense agreement, and the U.S. will be selling the Saudis extensive military equipment.",
      "The crown prince's visit has been filled with fanfare, complete with a military jet flyover, cannon fire and an elaborate White House dinner with some of the richest people in the world. But more meaningful to MBS is what Mr. Trump has said on camera about the leader of the country with a troubled human rights record.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's intelligence agencies in 2018 determining the crown prince ordered the killing of journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, Mr. Trump claimed in the Oval Office that MBS \"knew nothing about\" it. The president criticized reporters for asking questions about Khashoggi and Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Families of the victims are suing the Saudi government, and a federal judge reviewing thousands of pages of evidence from the attacks concluded the families can move forward with their case.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",

    "summary": "Annie Farmer, who testified that she was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, spoke to \"CBS Mornings\" about what she expects from the Epstein files.",
    "story": [
      "Annie Farmer, who testified that she was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0and Ghislaine Maxwell when she was 16 years old, said Congress' vote on the Epstein files \"feels like a victory, a long overdue victory.\"",
      "Both chambers of Congress passed a bill that would force the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files following President Trump's signature.",
      "Farmer said she believes the files contain information \"that we have not heard before.\"",
      "\"In terms of names of people that not only participated in these crimes but the people that enabled the crimes and the people that funded the crimes,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" on Wednesday.",
      "The Senate unanimously approved the Epstein Files Transparency Act to compel the documents release, following the House's 427 to 1 vote. The passage comes after months of opposition by many Republicans, including Mr. Trump, who recently changed his stance.",
      "\"I think that they felt pressure to get on the right side of history here because it was becoming so clear that this wasn't going away, that people cared about it,\" Farmer said.",
      "\"I feel hopeful\"",
      "Now, Farmer is hopeful for transparency, adding Tuesday's moment was bittersweet because of what it took to get there.",
      "\"I feel hopeful not because I have a lot of trust in the political process, but because of what I've seen, what is possible when people come together and demand something and pressure is placed by the American people here,\" she said. \"I appreciate everyone who spoke out about this.\"",
      "But she admitted she still has concerns about getting full transparency.",
      "Farmer's sister, Maria, who is also a survivor of Epstein's abuse and was one of the first in 1996 to report it to law enforcement, has made Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to investigations of Epstein over the years.",
      "\"The things that have been released have been heavily redacted and, therefore, you know, really not very helpful,\" Farmer said.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump asked the Department of Justice to investigate Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats, even though the FBI said over the summer that they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of Epstein-related materials and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "\"So these files should be available now. They should not be tied up in any kind of investigation,\" she said. \"But we're concerned about things like that, that might get in the way of what we're looking for.\"",
      "Maxwell's sentence",
      "Farmer testified at Maxwell's trial in 2021. A key accuser in the trial, Farmer said that she went to Epstein's New Mexico ranch in 1996 hoping he and Maxwell would help with academic endeavors. Farmer told jurors at the trial that Maxwell allegedly massaged her breasts and Epstein climbed into bed with her without her permission.",
      "Earlier this month, CBS News reported Maxwell planned to ask Mr. Trump to commute her sentence, according to documents obtained by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "\"She needs to serve her full sentence,\" Farmer said about Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for her role in the Epstein sex abuse case.",
      "\"She harmed so many more than just individuals that were involved in the trial and so I think to now see her getting this special treatment and potentially be receiving some kind of pardon, it's really unfathomable,\" Farmer said.",
      "In a letter from Democrats to Mr. Trump, which was seen by CBS News, the lawmakers alleged Maxwell was receiving preferential treatment.",
      "\"Federal law enforcement staff working at the camp have been waiting on Ms. Maxwell hand and foot,\" says the letter signed by Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee.",
      "\"I think it's absolutely disgusting that she's getting this preferential treatment,\" Farmer said.",
      "Maxwell's attorneys have denied she is trying to get her sentence reduced and that she is receiving preferential treatment, saying, \"It is clear that no effort to fact check the credibility or veracity of the so-called 'whistleblower' was made.\"",
      "Justice and healing",
      "Farmer said what justice looks like is \"a complicated question.\"",
      "\"A big part of it is just recognition of what actually happened here,\" she said.",
      "She said her sister Maria hasn't been given any protections as a whistleblower and has been threatened.",
      "\"I think just the acknowledgment that, 'wow, what you did was so brave and this didn't need to happen.' That there have been mistakes made over and over by law enforcement that we don't want those things to continue happening,\" she said.",
      "She added, \"I think the systemic institutional betrayals have not gotten the attention they deserve and those things we really do need to investigate in order to prevent.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, to the White House with an elaborate military display Tuesday, praising the crown prince and insisting the U.S.-Saudi relationship has never been better as the two countries look to sign major business and national security deals.",
      "The pomp and circumstance \u2014 and the president's praise and warmth toward MBS \u2014 were more typical of a visit from an allied Western democracy than an absolute monarchy with a troubled human rights record, pointing to the president's focus on economic and business ties above virtually all else. The White House sees Saudi Arabia as a critical security partner in a turbulent Middle East, as well as an economic partner.",
      "The White House arrival ceremony for the crown prince on Tuesday morning was laden with fanfare, complete with a U.S. military flyover, cannons, horses, and a red carpet. American and Saudi flags adorned the White House South Lawn, and a military band greeted the Saudi royal. Mr. Trump and the crown prince exchanged greetings as they shook hands, and then watched the formation of F-35 and F-16 fighter jets fly by before going inside the White House.",
      "The crown prince's meeting with the president concluded and MBS departed the White House Tuesday afternoon, though he returned later in the evening for a black-tie dinner in his honor. Guests spotted at the dinner included Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for Saudi team Al-Nassr.",
      "Ahead of bin Salman's arrival, Mr. Trump\u00a0told reporters\u00a0Monday that the U.S. would sell F-35 fighter jets to the Saudis. In the Oval Office, MBS said the Saudis will increase a planned investment of $600 billion in the U.S. to closer to $1 trillion, an announcement that pleased Mr. Trump greatly.",
      "Mr. Trump praised the crown prince in the Oval Office, calling him a \"very good friend\" and insisting his record on human rights is commendable, despite the State Department's long list of concerns of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Arbitrary and unlawful killings, disappearances, torture, serious restrictions on freedom of expression and restrictions on religious freedom continue to plague the nation, according to the latest 2024 State Department report.",
      "The trip to the White House is the crown prince's first U.S. visit since Washington Post journalist and human rights activist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul by members of the Saudi government. The president has smoothed over relations with the Saudis since the CIA assessed about a month after Khashoggi's killing, during Mr. Trump's first term, that the crown prince had\u00a0ordered it.",
      "Bin Salman has denied any involvement, but he\u00a0told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell\u00a0in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview, \"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\"",
      "The Biden administration later released the Trump-era intelligence report concluding the crown prince \"approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\"",
      "Bin Salman was asked about Khashoggi directly in the Oval Office Tuesday, giving U.S. reporters a rare chance to question the future king. \"About the journalist, it's really painful to hear that anyone losing his life for no real purpose,\" MBS said.",
      "The crown prince sought to distance the Saudi government from the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, as families of the attacks criticize the White House for inviting him. Bin Salman said he feels \"painful about families of 9/11 in America,\" but claimed Osama bin Laden used the Saudi people to \"destroy\" the American-Saudi relationship. Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years, drawing\u00a0vehement denials\u00a0from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized members of the media for some of the questions.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",
      "Later in the day Tuesday, the crown prince attended a dinner at the White House. There are 120 invited guests, according to a person familiar with the planning, and 30 will be from the Saudi delegation.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening's dinner is a perfect example of why his large ballroom under construction is necessary. Although it's not a state dinner, it is the first formal dinner hosted by Mr. Trump in his second term to honor a nation's leader. Bin Salman's father, Salman bin Abdulaziz, is technically the head of state of the kingdom, but he delegated his duties as ruler to MBS in 2017.",
      "\"We're more than meeting,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of the visit. \"We're honoring Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy, defense sales and the fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge, which was announced during the president's trip to Saudi Arabia in May.",
      "Mr. Trump is also planning to attend a Saudi business summit in Washington, D.C., Wednesday. An invitation previously obtained by CBS News said the event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia and the U.S.-Saudi Business Council.",
      "Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and former top White House adviser Jared Kushner have fostered close relationships with the Saudis and the crown prince in particular, viewing them as critical partners for both security and business in a turbulent Middle East. The president said the Abraham Accords \u2014 an agreement from his first term that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel, Bahrain and the UAE\u00a0 \u2014 would be a big topic of discussion during the visit.",
      "\"The Abraham Accords will be a part we're going to be discussing,\" Mr. Trump said over the weekend. \"I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly. We've had tremendous interest in the Abraham Accords since we put Iran out of business.\"",
      "Mr. Trump recently told \"60 Minutes\" contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell that he thought bin Salman would join the agreement, although the Saudis have indicated that would not happen without a path to Palestinian statehood.",
      "The Trumps also have extensive and longheld personal business ties in Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.",
      "Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told Reuters that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "And Kushner started a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received a reported $2 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by bin Salman.",
      "Asked about the potential conflicts of interest given his family business ties, Mr. Trump insisted Tuesday,\"I have nothing to do with the family business.\"",
      "\"They've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually, I'm sure they could do a lot,\" Mr. Trump said of his family.",
      "Criticism of human rights record",
      "Following the killing of Khashoggi, Mr. Trump did not seek to punish bin Salman personally during his first administration and said he viewed Saudi Arabia as a \"great ally,\" noting the economic ties between the U.S. and the Saudis. The Trump administration did sanction 19 Saudi nationals over the killing.",
      "\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Mr. Trump posted on social media in November 2018.",
      "\"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\"",
      "Human rights advocates are dismayed about the treatment bin Salman is expected to receive in Washington, not only because of Khashoggi's murder, but also because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record under bin Salman.",
      "\"We know President Trump won't ask MBS to reveal where Jamal's remains are so his family can finally bury him,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now, an organization Khashoggi founded months before he was killed. \"But the least he can do \u2014 the absolute minimum \u2014 is publicly press MBS to release the dozens of activists, writers and reformers languishing in Saudi prisons for the 'crime' of speaking freely.\"",
      "Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director at DAWN, called bin Salman's journey from castigation over Khashoggi's murder to a high-profile White House welcome an \"extraordinary political feat.\" And that's not just because of Mr. Trump's gestures of friendship toward the crown prince. Whitson mentioned the \"fist bump seen around the world,\" as former President Joe Biden warmly greeted Khashoggi in Riyadh during his presidency \"hat in hand.\"",
      "\"We went from the Biden administration narrowly sanctioning Mohamamd bin Salman himself for the murder of Khashoggi \u2026 to now welcoming him into Washington and not only sort of feting him for whatever lucrative deals he can pass to American businesses, but also to potentially actually help as a stabilizing force,\" Whitson said.",

      "The Australian government announced two weeks ago that the three Meta platforms plus Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders younger than 16, beginning Dec. 10.",
      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\"We will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information \"so we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.\"",
      "Meta has estimated there are 350,000 Australians aged 13-to-15 on Instagram and 150,000 in that age bracket on Facebook. Australia's population is 28 million.",
      "Account holders 16-years-old and older who were mistakenly given notice that they would be excluded can contact Yoti Age Verification and verify their age by providing government-issued identity documents or a \"video selfie,\" Meta said.",
      "Terry Flew, co-director of Sydney University's Center for AI, Trust and Governance, said such facial-recognition technology had a failure rate of at least 5%.",
      "\"In the absence of a government-mandated ID system, we're always looking at second-best solutions around these things,\" Flew told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "The government has warned platforms that demanding that all account holders prove they are older than 15 would be an unreasonable response to the new age restrictions. The government maintains the platforms already had sufficient data about many account holders to ascertain they were not young children.",
      "Social media companies will face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars (about $33 million) if they are found to be failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Meta's vice president and global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said she would prefer that app stores including Apple App Store and Google Play collect the age information when a user signs up and verifies they are at least 16 years old for app operators such as Facebook and Instagram.",
      "\"We believe a better approach is required: a standard, more accurate, and privacy-preserving system, such as OS/app store-level age verification,\" Davis said in a statement.",
      "\"This combined with our investments in ongoing efforts to assure age \u2026 offers a more comprehensive protection for young people online,\" she added.",
      "Dany Elachi, founder of the parents' group Heaps Up Alliance that lobbied for the social media age restriction, said parents should start helping their children plan on how they will spend the hours currently absorbed by social media.",
      "He was critical of the government's only announcing on the complete list of platforms that will become age-restricted on Nov. 5.",
      "\"There are aspects of the legislation that we're not entirely supportive of, but the principle that children under the age of 16 are better off in the real world, that's something we advocated for and are in favor of,\" Elachi said. \"When everybody misses out, nobody misses out. That's the theory. Certainly we expect that it would play out that way. We hope parents are going to be very positive about this and try to help their children see all the potential possibilities that are now open to them.\"",
      "There was significant resistance to the legislation last year, however, including from some children's advocacy groups.",
      "Mat Tinkler, CEO of Save the Children Australia, said\u00a0in a statement\u00a0a year ago, when the ban was approved by Australian lawmakers, that while he welcomed the government's efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than a blanket ban.",
      "He said the government should \"instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits.\"",
      "The\u00a0Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, also expressed \"serious reservations\" over the law before it was approved, saying last year that there were \"less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies.\"",

      "Zhi Dong Zhang, also known as \"Brother Wang\" among other aliases, pleaded not guilty to the charges at his arraignment Wednesday in Brooklyn federal court. His lawyer declined to comment following the court appearance.",
      "Federal officials say Zhang ran a vast drug trafficking and money laundering operation that imported thousands of pounds of narcotics into the United States and other countries.",
      "\"The defendant stands accused of running a global enterprise that pumped massive quantities of cocaine, fentanyl, and methamphetamine into our communities and laundered millions in narcotics proceeds,\" U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement. \"His return to the United States is a major step in dismantling a network that has fueled addiction, violence, and death.\"",
      "Zhang's criminal organization operated out of Mexico going back at least to 2016 and laundered its drug proceeds through shell companies created in the U.S. using false social security numbers and other fraudulent documents, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "Officials identified more than 100 shell companies tied to Zhang's organization that were used to launder at least $77 million in narcotics proceeds, they said.",
      "Mexican authorities captured Zhang in Mexico City in October 2024 at the request of the U.S. government, but a judge granted him house arrest and he escaped the home where he was being held under military guard. Prosecutors say in court filings that he was eventually recaptured in Cuba and sent to the U.S. by Mexican authorities on Oct. 23.",

    "story": [
      "Taipei \u2014 Images of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te holding a plate of sushi were posted on social media on Thursday in a show of support for Tokyo after reports that China will halt Japanese seafood imports.",
      "The row between Japan and China was triggered by new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggesting this month that Tokyo could intervene militarily in any attack on Taiwan.",
      "China claims democratic Taiwan as part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring the self-ruled island under its control.",
      "Lai, an outspoken defender of Taiwan's sovereignty who is often sharply criticized by Chinese officials for his stance, has accused Beijing of \"severely\" affecting regional peace in the escalating spat.",
      "A photo of a smiling Lai holding a plate of sushi was posted on his Facebook page.",
      "\"Today's lunch is sushi and miso soup,\" a message posted with the photo said, along with the hashtag #Yellowtail from Kagoshima and scallops from Hokkaido.",
      "Similar photos were posted on Lai's X account, with the message and hashtag written in Japanese.",
      "A video of Lai suggesting to followers that now \"might be a good time to eat Japanese cuisine\" was also shared on his Instagram page.",

      "NASA released close-up images on Wednesday of the rare interstellar comet that's making a single pass through the solar system.",
      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",

    "story": [
      "Two people were killed in an attack on a church in central Nigeria, authorities said, just days after dozens of schoolgirls were abducted and one staffer killed in the country's north.",
      "No group has claimed responsibility for Tuesday night's attack in Eruku town in central Nigeria. Police responded to gunfire and found one person fatally shot inside the church and another nearby, Kwara state police spokesperson Adetoun Ejire-Adeyemi said in a statement.",
      "Kwara State Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq in a statement Wednesday praised Nigerian President Bola Tinubu for the deployment of 900 additional troops there.",
      "Tinubu has delayed his departure to South Africa, where he planned to attend this weekend's Group of 20 summit of the world's leading rich and developing nations after the attack and the abduction of 24 schoolgirls on Monday, a spokesperson, Bayo Onanuga, said in a statement.",
      "One of 25 abducted students in northwestern Nigeria escapes",
      "Twenty-five schoolgirls were reported abducted from the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Kebbi state's Maga town Monday, but one escaped and is now safe, the school's principal told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

      "The Nigerian government has vehemently rejected the claims. Tinubu has said the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality. While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said on Nov. 1. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",

    "summary": "An airstrike killed 13 people in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh. It was the deadliest Israeli attack reported since a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war a year ago.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli military carried out airstrikes in southern Lebanon Wednesday on what it said were Hezbollah weapons storage facilities after a drone strike earlier in the day killed one person and wounded several others, including students on a bus.",
      "The new strikes came as tensions between Israel and Lebanon are escalating. An airstrike Tuesday night killed 13 people in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh, in southern Lebanon. It was the deadliest Israeli attack reported since a\u00a0ceasefire\u00a0in the Israel-Hezbollah war a year ago.",
      "Meanwhile, hospitals in Gaza said Israeli strikes killed at least 21 Palestinians.",
      "Israel claims Hezbollah is regrouping",
      "The Israeli military warned Wednesday afternoon it would strike targets in several villages in southern Lebanon, describing them as Hezbollah infrastructure, and called on people to move away from the locations. More than an hour later, the strikes began in the villages of Shehour and Deir Kifa. There was no immediate word on casualties.",
      "Israel's military said Hezbollah was working to reestablish itself and rebuild its capacity in southern Lebanon, without providing evidence. It said the weapons' facilities targeted were embedded among civilians and violated understandings between Israel and Lebanon. Israel agreed to a ceasefire and withdrew from southern Lebanon last year. For its part, Lebanon agreed to quell Hezbollah activity in the area.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike on a car in the southern Lebanese village of Tiri killed one person and wounded 11, including students aboard a nearby bus, the Lebanese Health Ministry and state media said. State-run National News Agency said the school bus happened to be passing near the car that was hit. The bus driver and several students were wounded, the report said.",
      "The Israeli military later said it killed a Hezbollah operative in the drone strike.",
      "In Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp, just outside the port city of Sidon, life appeared normal Wednesday, but Lebanese authorities prevented journalists from entering. At the scene of the strike, paramedics searched for human remains around a wall that was stained with blood. Several cars were burnt and broken glass and debris littered the ground.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas training compound that was being used to prepare an attack against Israel and its army. It added that the Israeli army would continue to act against Hamas wherever it operates.",
      "Hamas condemned the attack and denied in a statement that the sports playground that was hit was its training compound.",
      "The latest Israel-Hezbollah war began Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel, after Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel in solidarity with Hamas. The war killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $11 billion worth of destruction, according to the World Bank. In Israel, 127 people died, including 80 soldiers.",
      "Israeli strikes kill 21 in Gaza",
      "Hospitals in Gaza said at least 21 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes Wednesday on both sides of the yellow line established in last month's ceasefire. The boundary splits the enclave in two, leaving the border zone under Israeli military control while the area beyond it is meant to serve as a safe zone.",
      "Officials at al-Ahli, Shifa, Nasser and Kuwaiti hospitals reported they received the bodies of those killed from Gaza City, Khan Younis and the Muwasi area, the southern Gaza displacement camp. An Israeli strike also killed one person in Shijaiyah, a Gaza City neighborhood outside the safe zone where Israeli forces remain deployed.",
      "The Israeli military said its strikes responded to militants who had opened fire on Israeli forces in Khan Younis earlier in the day. It said no soldiers were killed.",
      "Israeli strikes have decreased since the ceasefire agreement took effect on Oct. 10, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, though they have not stopped entirely. The ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, has reported 280 deaths since the truce began, an average of more than seven per day. Each side has accused the other of violating its terms, which include increasing the flow of aid into Gaza and returning hostages \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 to Israel.",
      "On Monday, the U.N. Security Council approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the territory and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state. The vote was a crucial next step for the fragile ceasefire and efforts to outline Gaza's future after two years of war.",
      "Hamas, however, criticized the U.N.'s adoption of the plan, saying, \"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation,\" according to Reuters.",
      "\"Any international force, if established, must be stationed solely on the borders to separate the forces and monitor the ceasefire, and must be entirely under the supervision of the United Nations,\" Hamas said, according to Al Jazeera.",

    "summary": "President Trump said the U.S. is getting involved in peace efforts in Sudan at the request of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the U.S. is getting involved in efforts to strike peace in Sudan amid an ongoing civil war there, at the request of his \"very good friend\" Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump made the announcement Wednesday as he spoke at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, one day after a lengthy meeting with the crown prince, known as MBS, in the Oval Office. The State Department has already said the U.S. has been working with international partners, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, to broker an end to the war, but the president said he views the situation \"differently now than I did just a day ago.\"",
      "The people of Sudan are suffering from a staggering humanitarian crisis, as the two-and-a-half-year war takes its toll. The power struggle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, has displaced millions, sparked famine and led to claims of genocide. Mr. Trump said he wasn't planning to get involved in the yearslong conflict in Sudan, but the crown prince suggested he add Sudan to his list of peace deals he has helped broker. The United Nations says what's happening in Sudan is the greatest humanitarian crisis on Earth.",
      "\"His majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan,\" Mr. Trump told his audience at the U.S.-Saudi business forum. \"It was not on my charts to be involved in that. ... But I just see how important that is to you and to a lot of your friends in the room, Sudan, and we're going to start working on Sudan.\"",
      "The president's announcement was met with great applause in the room. Mr. Trump said his administration got started on working for peace in Sudan about half an hour after his meeting with MBS concluded Tuesday.",
      "\"And you know we've already started working on that, OK?\" he said.",
      "Earlier this month, a State Department spokesperson told reporters the Trump administration was engaging directly with the RSF and the Sudanese army, and called on both sides to \"move forward in response to the U.S.-led effort to conclude a humanitarian truce, given the immediate urgency of de-escalating the violence and ending the suffering of the Sudanese people.\"",
      "But the president's push for action draws more focus to the region, while spotlighting MBS' influence. Mr. Trump has emphasized his excellent relationship with MBS, as well as the \"great wealth\" the Saudis are pouring into the U.S.",
      "MBS announced Tuesday in the Oval Office that a planned $600 billion investment in the U.S. from Saudi entities would be closer to $1 trillion. The two leaders also signed what the president called a \"historic\" and \"strategic\" defense agreement, and the U.S. will be selling the Saudis extensive military equipment.",
      "The crown prince's visit has been filled with fanfare, complete with a military jet flyover, cannon fire and an elaborate White House dinner with some of the richest people in the world. But more meaningful to MBS is what Mr. Trump has said on camera about the leader of the country with a troubled human rights record.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's intelligence agencies in 2018 determining the crown prince ordered the killing of journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, Mr. Trump claimed in the Oval Office that MBS \"knew nothing about\" it. The president criticized reporters for asking questions about Khashoggi and Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Families of the victims are suing the Saudi government, and a federal judge reviewing thousands of pages of evidence from the attacks concluded the families can move forward with their case.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",

    "summary": "Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll traveled to Ukraine this week on a fact-finding mission regarding military technology as the Trump administration explores restarting peace talks.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday as part of a delegation of senior Pentagon officials on a fact-finding mission to discuss military technology and explore ways to restart peace talks, according to multiple U.S. officials.",
      "The delegation includes Driscoll, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, the commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa Gen. Chris Donahue, and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Weimer.",
      "The White House picked Driscoll to lead the delegation, according to one U.S. official. It opted to send a delegation from the Pentagon in part because the officials will be able to speak from a military perspective, which may be more effective in getting through to the Russians, the official said.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported the visit.",
      "\"Secretary Driscoll and team arrived this morning in Kyiv on behalf of the administration on a factfinding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,\" Army spokesman Colonel David Butler said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "During the visit, Driscoll will view Ukrainian technology from the Ukrainian military and defense industry, according to a defense official.",
      "Driscoll told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that Ukraine's use of drones and AI technology is an \"incredible treasure trove of information for future warfare.\" He referred to the stunning surprise attack launched in June by Ukraine deep inside Russia \u2014 Operation Spider's Web \u2014 which used what Driscoll called a \"couple hundred thousand dollars worth of drones\" to destroy Russian equipment valued at about $10 billion. During Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the White House last month, he offered drone technology to the U.S.",
      "Over the course of a few days in Ukraine, Driscoll will also spend time with top Ukrainian leaders and is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy to try to restart negotiations.",
      "A Ukrainian official told CBS the focus of the visit would be on the military situation on the ground in addition to plans for a possible ceasefire. The official said Driscoll's visit \"is extremely important, as we are stepping into a decisive phase now.\"",
      "\"Presidents Zelenskyy and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees,\" the Ukrainian official added, noting that Ukraine has also spoken with the group of over 30 countries that support it. \"Ukraine has also held talks with the \"Coalition of the Willing\" on the security guarantees.\" Ukraine has not agreed to permanently cede that territory to Russia.",
      "\"I think a lot of the questions are, how do we actually execute on the president's agenda of peace in that part of the world,\" Driscoll said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"I have not been to the White House, where it has not come up that we just want peace so that the American industrial base can thrive everywhere, and we have to focus on that part of the world unnecessarily right now.\"",
      "Negotiations to end the war have largely stalled since the spring, even after President Trump attempted to revive them in the summer and fall during a summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin and a meeting at the White House with Zelenskyy.",
      "Since then, the U.S. has resumed intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which has used U.K-provided long-range equipment, as well as drones, to conduct attacks on Russia.",
      "A defense official also told CBS News that Driscoll intends to meet with Russian officials in the future, but there are no meetings scheduled yet. A Russian official confirmed to CBS News that Russia is open to any talks and negotiations, and reiterated that in August, Putin had invited Mr. Trump to Moscow.",
      "In an interview with Axios conducted Monday, Putin adviser Kirill Dmitriev said that he and Trump envoy Steve Witkoff had written a 28-point peace plan during a face-to-face visit last month in Miami.",
      "Just days after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas in October, Dmitriev traveled to the U.S. to hold previously scheduled talks with Witkoff in an effort to continue to make progress on a proposal to end the war, as a senior U.S. official described it at the time.",
      "Dmitriev is under U.S. sanctions himself, and the Treasury Department had to waive them so that he could\u00a0 travel to the U.S. Asked by Brennan on \"Face the Nation\" about those meetings, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed Dmitriev as a \"Russian propagandist.\"",
      "A defense official contacted by CBS News was unable to comment on the 28-point plan described by Dmitriev to Axios, but said that Driscoll intends to open the door to discussing a peace plan. A Russian Embassy official contacted by CBS declined comment on the reported 28-point plan. Dmitriev's spokesperson did not respond in time for publication.",
      "On Tuesday, at a news conference in Spain, Zelenskyy said he intended to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss \"a just peace for Ukraine.\" A State Department official denied reports that Witkoff would be traveling to T\u00fcrkiye for diplomatic meetings with Ukraine.",

    "summary": "100 new security cameras and unspecified anti-intrusion systems will be among the \"emergency measures\" implemented at Paris' iconic Louvre Museum.",
    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 The head of the Louvre Museum said Wednesday that new surveillance cameras and anti-intrusion systems will soon be installed at the Paris landmark after last month's stunning crown jewels heist.",
      "The cameras \u2014 some 100 of them \u2014 will be up and running by the end of next year while anti-intrusion systems will start to be put in place within two weeks, Louvre director Laurence des Cars said.",
      "She described the systems as equipment that will prevent intruders from getting close to the museum buildings but did not offer specifics. The new surveillance cameras will try to ensure \"complete protection of the museum's surroundings,\" she said.",
      "\"After the shock, after the emotion, after the assessment, it's time for action\" at the world's most visited museum, des Cars told the Committee of Cultural Affairs of the National Assembly.",
      "She said it was all part of more than 20 \"emergency measures\" that will be implemented. The new measures also include the creation of a \"security coordinator\" position at the museum, and the job has been posted this month, she added.",
      "On the day of the heist, it took thieves less than eight minutes to force their way through a window into the Apollo Gallery with the help of a freight lift and steal the 88 million euros ($102 million) trove.",
      "At least five people have been arrested, but none of the jewels have been recovered. Master jeweler and Parisian gem appraiser Stephen Portier told CBS News the thieves would struggle to sell the loot.",
      "\"The whole world knows about this robbery. Dealers will have pictures of every single piece up in their offices,\" he said. \"So if they think they're being offered diamonds from the Louvre ... they will ask some hard questions. And contact the police.\"",
      "Des Cars unveiled some new details about the security breach that allowed the Oct. 19 robbery, saying the power tools used by robbers to cut through the display cases were disc cutters meant for concrete.",
      "\"It's a method that had not been imagined at all\" when the display cases in the Apollo Gallery were replaced in 2019, she said. At the time, they had been designed primarily to counter an attack from inside the museum with weapons, she added.",
      "Footage from museum cameras show that during the robbery, the display cases \"held up remarkably well and did not break apart,\" she said. \"Videos show how difficult it was for the thieves.\"",
      "Des Cars stressed security improvement is a priority of the decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan launched earlier this year, with an estimated cost of up to 800 million euros ($933 million), to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "With the Louvre crumbling under the weight of mass tourism, des Cars has restricted the daily number of visitors to 30,000 in recent years.",
      "The famed glass pyramid inaugurated in 1989 was meant to welcome about 4 millions visitors a year, she recalled. This year, already more than 8 million people visited the Louvre.",
      "\"The extensive modernization that the Louvre underwent in the 1980s is now technically obsolete, with equipment that has been overperforming for 40 years,\" des Cars said.",
      "On Monday, the Louvre announced it was temporarily closing some employee offices and one public gallery because they were structurally fragile.",

      "London \u2014 Britain warned Russia on Wednesday that it was ready to deal with any incursions into its territory after the spy ship Yantar was detected on the edge of U.K. waters north of Scotland.",
      "Defense Secretary John Healey said the Russian vessel had directed lasers at pilots of surveillance aircraft monitoring its activities.",
      "\"This is the first time we've had this action from Yantar directed against the British RAF. We take it extremely seriously,\" Healey said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"My message to Russia and to Putin is this: We see you. We know what you're doing,'' Healey said during a briefing in London. \"And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready.\"",
      "\"We have military options ready should the Yantar change course,\" Reuters quoted him as saying.",
      "British officials said the Yantar is part of the Russian navy, designed to conduct surveillance in peacetime and sabotage during times of war. Because of this, the U.K. and its allies track the ship and work to deter its operations whenever it approaches British territorial waters.",
      "\"It is part of a Russian fleet designed to put and hold our undersea infrastructure and those of our allies at risk,\" Healey said, referencing attacks on pipelines and cables under the Baltic Sea earlier this year.",
      "This isn't the first time the Yantar has probed Britain's defenses, Healey said. After a warning last year, the Yantar left U.K. waters for the Mediterranean. When the Russian ship later sailed through the English Channel in January, it was followed by HMS Somerset, a frigate assigned to homeland defense in the waters around Britain.",

    "story": [
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday ruled out allowing U.S. strikes against cartels on Mexican soil, a day after President Trump said he was willing to do whatever it takes to stop drugs entering the U.S. Meanwhile, Mexican and American diplomats were trying to sort out what may have been an actual U.S. incursion.",
      "On Monday, men arrived in a boat at a beach in northeast Mexico and installed some signs signaling land that the U.S. Department of Defense considered restricted.",
      "Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry said late Monday that the country's navy had removed the signs, which appeared to be on Mexican territory. \"The origin of the signs and their placement on national territory were unclear,\" the ministry said in a statement.",
      "On Tuesday, Sheinbaum said the International Boundary and Water Commission, a binational agency that determines the border between the two countries, was getting involved.",
      "The signs, driven into the sand near where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf of Mexico, caused a stir when witnesses said men in a boat arrived at the local beach known as Playa Bagdad and erected them.",
      "The signs read in English and Spanish, \"Warning: Restricted Area,\" and went on to explain that it was Department of Defense property and had been declared restricted by \"the commander.\" It said there could be no unauthorized access, photography or drawings of the area.",
      "CBS 4 News Rio Grande Valley posted an image of one of the signs on social media.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Mexico shared a comment from the Pentagon Tuesday about the incident, confirming that contractors putting up signs to mark the \"National Defense Area III\" had placed signs at the mouth of the Rio Grande.",
      "\"Changes in water depth and topography altered the perception of the international boundary's location,\" the statement said. \"Government of Mexico personnel removed 6 signs based on their perception of the international boundary's location.\"",
      "The Pentagon said the contractors would \"coordinate with appropriate agencies to avoid confusion in the future.\"",
      "Mexico had contacted its consulate in Brownsville, Texas, and then the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. Eventually, it was determined that contractors working for some U.S. government entity had placed the signs, Sheinbaum said.",
      "\"But the river changes its course, it breaks loose and according to the treaty you have to clearly demarcate the national border,\" Sheinbaum said during her daily press briefing Tuesday.",
      "The area is close to SpaceX Starbase, which sits adjacent to Boca Chica Beach on the Texas side of the Rio Grande.",
      "The facility and launch site for the SpaceX rocket program is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA, which hopes to send astronauts back to the moon and someday to Mars.",
      "In June, Sheinbaum said the government was looking into contamination from the SpaceX facility after pieces of metal, plastic and rocket pieces were reportedly found on the Mexican side of the border following the explosion of a rocket during a test.",
      "The area also carries the added sensitivity of Mr. Trump's order to\u00a0rename the Gulf of Mexico\u00a0as the Gulf of America, which Mexico has also rejected.",
      "Meanwhile, Sheinbaum on Tuesday again rejected Mr. Trump's offer of military intervention against cartels.",
      "\"It's not going to happen,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "\"He (Trump) has suggested it on various occasions or he has said, 'we offer you a United States military intervention in Mexico, whatever you need to fight the criminal groups,'\" she said. \"But I have told him on every occasion that we can collaborate, that they can help us with information they have, but that we operate in our territory, that we do not accept any intervention by a foreign government.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said she had said this to Mr. Trump and to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on previous occasions and that they have understood.",
      "\"Would I want strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? OK with me, whatever we have to do to stop drugs,\" Mr. Trump said Monday, adding that he's \"not happy with Mexico.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he will designate Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally, marking a step up in defense ties between the United States and the Gulf monarchy.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the move at a black-tie dinner at the White House in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders signed a new strategic defense deal earlier in the day, and Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The designation could open the door to further collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. military, including easier access to U.S.-made military equipment. It's also a symbolic move: Mr. Trump said in brief remarks Tuesday evening that it would take \"our military cooperation to even greater heights.\"",
      "There are currently 20 major non-NATO allies, including other Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.",
      "\"A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries, and it will serve the highest interests of peace,\" Mr. Trump said during Tuesday's dinner.",
      "The U.S.'s close relationship with Saudi Arabia dates back eight decades, bookended by a meeting between King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud and former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser in 1945. The two countries have long cooperated on defense, and in recent decades, they have been bound together in part by a mutual rivalry with Iran.",
      "During Tuesday's meetings \u2014 marked by elaborate White House ceremonies and a military flyover \u2014 Mr. Trump pressed for even further military and economic cooperation with the Gulf state. The White House said\u00a0Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will buy hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and will partner with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and civil nuclear issues, while bin Salman pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion in the U.S., up from $600 billion.",
      "Members of Mr. Trump's family also have some business interests in the country. Mr. Trump insisted earlier Tuesday he has \"nothing to do\" with those deals, and \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "Still unclear is whether Saudi Arabia will sign onto the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic deals brokered by Mr. Trump between Israel and majority-Muslim states like the United Arab Emirates. Most of those agreements were inked during the president's first term, and Mr. Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he believes Saudi Arabia will also join.",
      "During an Oval Office event earlier Tuesday, bin Salman told reporters he wants to join the accords but needs to see a path toward a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump added that the two leaders \"had a very good talk on the Abraham Accords.\"",
      "But Saudi Arabia's human rights record makes it a controversial U.S. partner. American intelligence agencies concluded in 2021 that bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who regularly criticized the country's regime in the pages of The Washington Post.",

    "summary": "President Trump accused a journalist of trying to \"embarrass\" Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Tuesday that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, despite a 2021 intelligence report finding bin Salman ordered the killing.",
      "\"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\" Mr. Trump said about Khashoggi in response to a question from a journalist about his business dealings with bin Salman despite the intelligence report's findings. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it and we can leave it at that.\"",
      "Sitting next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office while\u00a0visiting the White House, bin Salman said, \"About the journalist, it's really painful to hear that anyone losing his life for no real purpose.\" The crown prince also said, \"We did all the right steps in terms of investigation, etc., in Saudi Arabia and we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that.\"",
      "\"It's painful and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that will never happen again,\" bin Salman said.",
      "Bin Salman is making his first visit to the White House since Khashoggi's murder. Bin Salman has denied any involvement, but he told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview, \"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\"",
      "The 2021 U.S. intelligence report concluded that \"the Crown Prince has had absolute control over the Kingdom's security and intelligence organizations, making it highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince's authorization.\"",
      "After Mr. Trump's comments Tuesday, Khashoggi's widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, directed a message on social media to him, writing, \"There is no justification to murder my husband.\"",
      "\"While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press,\" she wrote.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, she said she was \"hurt\" and \"disappointed\" by the Oval Office remarks.",
      "Mr. Trump called bin Salman his friend and praised him as \"incredible on human rights and everything else\" as the Saudi royal made his first visit to the White House since Khashoggi's killing.",
      "Mr. Trump also insisted he has \"nothing to do\" with his family's business dealings with Saudi Arabia, and said, \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "As families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack have pursued a civil lawsuit alleging the kingdom sponsored, aided and supported the al Qaeda hijackers, bin Salman has sought to distance the Saudi government from the attack.",
      "\"I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America, but you know, we have to focus on reality,\" bin Salman said Tuesday. \"Reality based on CIA documents and based on a lot of documents that Osama bin Laden used Saudi people in that event for one purpose: To destroy this relation, the American-Saudi relationship.\"",
      "Bin Salman said that \"whoever buys that\" is \"helping Osama bin Laden's purpose of destroying this relation.\" Bin Salman said bin Laden knew the \"strong\" relationship between America and Saudi Arabia is \"bad for extremism.\"",
      "Bin Salman and Mr. Trump announced Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will increase its investments of $600 billion in the U.S. to nearly $1 trillion.",

      "Bin Salman, who goes by MBS, agreed that the figure would be close to $1 trillion.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first administration, the president touted $450 billion in Saudi investments in the U.S., but an economic analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute found that exports of American goods and services to Saudi Arabia from 2017 to 2020 totaled just a fifth of that, around $92 billion.",
      "A May 2017 defense agreement with the kingdom worth around $110 billion was supposed to take effect immediately, the White House said at the time. But according to records kept by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign military sales, the Defense Department formally notified Congress of roughly $23 billion in possible arms sales to Saudi Arabia between 2017 and 2020.",

      "Reacting to the meeting between the two leaders, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi recounted what she said were \"seven years of hell\" in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday. She said that her husband did not deserve to be brutally killed over his criticism of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and that she has not received an apology or seen any actions of accountability from the crown prince.",
      "\"It destroyed my life. It inverted my life,\" Elatr told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout.\"",
      "Elatr came to the U.S. in August 2020 to apply for asylum because she feared for her safety, and was granted it in November 2023,\u00a0according to\u00a0CBS News' partner network BBC News. She had been living in Dubai, where she also grew up, prior to coming to the U.S.",
      "\"I was sharing his mission and vision. I'm the one supporting him in his exile. I was speaking up, putting in my social media, but it fired back at me,\" she said, adding that she was detained many times following his death and placed on house arrest until she decided to come to the U.S.",
      "Upon moving to the U.S., she alleges that she learned authorities in the United Arab Emirates had been surveilling even her prior to her husband's death, in collaboration with Saudi authorities.",

In the first two weeks following his disappearance, Saudi officials denied any knowledge. Mr. Trump at the time admitted the nation had been untruthful, but\u00a0resisted blaming MBS for Khashoggi's death.",
      "\"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it and we can leave it at that,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday.",
      "Elatr said she was \"disappointed\" to hear Mr. Trump describing her husband in a way that \"kind of justifies a crime.\"",
      "\"To say he's controversial ... it does not give anyone the right to just kidnap him, torture him, kill him and dismantle his body,\" she told CBS News. \"This hurt me a lot. It's taking away, as well, the freedom for the journalists to do their job. ... And what is the different then between U.S. and any dictatorship in Middle Eastern country?\"",

      "\"He admitted verbally, he took responsibility verbally, but he did not take any action to show the world there is rectifying of this crime,\" Elatr said Tuesday. \"... I did not receive an official apology myself as a wife, as they destroyed my life. They've taken my lover.\"",
      "Despite the 2021 intelligence report's findings, Elatr told CBS News that she doesn't know if MBS was directly responsible.",
      "\"I'm not sure 100% the order was given by the crown prince himself because I don't have the tools, I don't have the intelligence. I don't have a country to support me to dig in and to make sure,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Documents suggest Epstein had contacts with the Saudi royal family and traveled to the Kingdom in the last years of his life.",
    "story": [
      "In late 2016, Jeffrey Epstein flew his private Gulfstream G550 alone from Paris to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and emerged from the visit with a lavish gift, apparently from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It was a tent, \"carpets and all,\" as he later described it. Bedouin tents, in Middle Eastern culture, are a symbol of hospitality.",
      "What Epstein was doing to be honored with that gift is currently a mystery.",
      "This was one of several meetings and interactions Epstein had with world leaders, according to emails and documents released in recent weeks that detail his activities in the final years of his life. They also included meetings with other members of the Saudi royal family.",
      "Bin Salman is visiting Washington this week and meeting with President Trump. It's a major moment for the Kingdom as it seeks to enhance its global image in the wake of the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. So far, Epstein's business dealings with the Kingdom and members of the royal family have largely avoided close scrutiny.",
      "Much of that information comes from the release of hundreds of text messages, emails and other documents sent to the House Oversight Committee by Epstein's estate as part of the committee's investigation. Revelations about the tent and carpets were included in emails between Epstein and Hyatt executive chairman Tom Pritzker.",
      "Epstein's planning for his 2016 trip included an email from his assistant saying, \"Did you need me to book the Four Seasons for you in Riyadh? Or is the king taking care of it!?\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Saudi officials in D.C. for comment and has not had a response by time of publication.",
      "There is no evidence that anyone involved in the Saudi government had involvement with anything related to Epstein's sex trafficking allegations.",
      "Why Epstein's estate has chosen to release certain documents is not clear. The release is in response to a subpoena that included requests for documents relating to his finances, as well as potential victims. What has been released is likely a fraction of what the estate possesses of Epstein's communications, and it's not clear if there will be future releases that could provide additional details. Epstein maintained extensive communication with his staff, financial clients and friends over the years.",
      "As Congress voted almost unanimously on Tuesday to demand the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files, most of the public's focus has been on his sex crimes \u2014 but any release of additional documents could reveal more about Epstein's vast global business connections, which have so far remained mostly unknown.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, told CBS News there are a host of unanswered questions stemming from Epstein's financial dealings all around the globe.",
      "\"My own investigation has found that Epstein was moving hundreds of millions of dollars around the world during the years he operated his cross-border sex trafficking operation, but it's still not clear who among his foreign network knew about his trafficking, enabled it, and participated in it,\" Wyden said.",
      "Epstein, who fashioned himself as an elite money manager, was also advising the governments of Mongolia and the Maldives, as well as traveling and presumably making or seeking business deals in the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, the Ivory Coast, China, Russia, Qatar and Belarus, according to those documents. But Epstein's contacts with Saudi Arabia appear to have been some of his most extensive and potentially lucrative dealings with foreign leaders.",
      "Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman consolidated his control in Saudi Arabia in 2017 following a purge of high level government officials. A few days later, New York Times reporter Thomas Landon Jr. emailed Epstein, \"Did your Saudi friends survive the purge?\" Epstein responded, \"All. With gods help ;).\"",
      "Epstein discussed another brush with the Saudi crown prince in April 2018. It comes up in a text message exchange with an individual whose name is redacted in the documents, but who appears from the context of their chat to be former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Epstein writes, \"MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] has the Louvre and 400 guards. To himself,\" and he indicates that he is on his way over.",
      "\"No better way to spend s(sic) Sunday,\" came the reply.",
      "That evening, French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted a photo of himself and bin Salman at the Louvre with the caption, \"With Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\" CBS News has reached out to the government of France to find out if Epstein was present, but has not received a response.",
      "That document ended with a text the following day from Epstein to Bannon: \"If you are around the 18th, in dc. John Kerry,\" the former senator, presidential candidate and secretary of state.",
      "A spokesperson for Kerry told CBS News that he was back home in Boston after the end of his service in the Obama administration. \"He wasn't in Washington, DC, was never scheduled to be in Washington, and did not have a meeting or meeting request from that cast of characters, period, which isn't surprising since he didn't have a relationship with either one of them, and wasn't in contact with either of them,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "According to other messages sent from Epstein, he was planning another visit for the summer of 2019 to Saudi Arabia. That trip never happened due to his arrest and incarceration on federal sex crime charges.",
      "Other signs of the connections between Epstein and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have surfaced since his death. Authorities found a photograph of Epstein posing with bin Salman prominently displayed in his Manhattan mansion, according to The New York Times.",
      "After Epstein's arrest in 2019, officials also discovered that he held an expired Austrian passport from the 1980s with his picture and a false name, which listed his residence as Saudi Arabia.",

Munich police on Tuesday confirmed the deaths, saying in an emailed statement that it was a \"joint suicide.\" In a statement, the German Society for Humane Dying confirmed to Bavarian Broadcasting that it was an assisted suicide.",
      "The Kessler twins learned to dance at a young age and joined the Leipzig Opera children's ballet. In 1952, when they were 16, their family fled to West Germany, where they danced in a revue theater in D\u00fcsseldorf. In 1955, the sisters were discovered by the director of the Lido cabaret theater in Paris, where their international career took off.",
      "In the 1960s, the Kessler twins toured worldwide, moved to Rome and performed with Astaire, Sinatra and Belafonte. They turned down an offer to appear with Elvis Presley in \"Viva Las Vegas\" in 1964 for fear of becoming defined by musical films in America, dpa reported.",
      "Even at 80, the sisters appeared on stage in a musical. Alice said shortly before their 80th birthday that they probably wouldn't have managed to perform for so long alone.",
      "Being a twosome \"only has advantages,\" she said. \"Together you're stronger.\"",
      "Asked about the secret of their success, she remarked: \"Discipline, every day. Gratitude, time and again. Humility, not cockiness. And togetherness. Until death.\"",
      "The twins told the German tabloid\u00a0Bild\u00a0in April 2024 that they wanted to be buried in the same urn, along with the ashes of their mother and dog. \"That's what we stipulated in our wills,\" Ellen Kessler told Bild.",

      "Currently, some New York lawmakers and advocates are calling for Gov. Kathy Hochul to sign the \"Medical Aid In Dying\" bill, also known as MAID.

    "summary": "An archeological investigation into an ancient city in central Asia has shed new light on the region's economic history.",
    "story": [
      "An expansive ancient city has been unearthed in central Asia, shedding light on the area's industrial history and ranking as \"one of the most remarkable archaeological discoveries in this region for decades,\" according to the lead author of a landmark new\u00a0report\u00a0on the site.",
      "The report, from researchers at the United Kingdom's Durham University and University College London as well as Kazakhstan's Toraighyrov University, offers the fullest picture to date of what Semiyarka, the \"City of Seven Ravines,\" may have been like in its prime more than 3,500 years ago.",
      "Located on the Kazakh Steppe, a vast grassland that covers northern Kazakhstan and parts of Russia, Semiyarka spanned some 350 acres and is currently the largest known ancient settlement in that region, according to the report. Originating around 1600 B.C.E. during the Bronze Age, the city was among only a few production centers at the time and the first on the Kazakh Steppe now known to have had bronze-producing capabilities.",
      "That's important for understanding the early communities of the steppe region, researchers said, as the archaeological evidence for Semiyarka's well-organized metal economy challenges prior beliefs that such societies did not exist in the area when Semiyarka did. The ancient city, which is called \"Seven Ravines\" because of its location overlooking multiple valleys, developed during a period where nomadic people began to form permanent or semipermanent settlements.",
      "Researchers previously thought only seminomadic people lived on the Kazakh Steppe at that time. But what they found after years of archaeological exploration of Semiyarka indicates that the site was not only a large-scale metal producer but, potentially, a crucial trading post with regional power. Its size, along with remnants of its manufacturing, \"highlight its potential importance for advancing our understanding of regional settlement patterns, social organisation and technology,\" researchers wrote in their report.",
      "\"This is one of the most remarkable archaeological discoveries in this region for decades. Semiyarka changes the way we think about steppe societies,\" Miljana Radivojevi\u0107, an archaeological researcher at University College London and the report's lead author, said in a\u00a0statement released by the university. \"It shows that mobile communities could build and sustain permanent, organised settlements centred on a likely large-scale industry \u2014 a true 'urban hub' of the steppe.\"",
      "Researchers at Toraighyrov University initially identified Semiyarka in the early 2000s, but the city was never thoroughly investigated before now.",
      "\"I have been surveying Semiyarka for many years with the support of Kazakh national research funding,\" said Viktor Merz, of Toraighyrov University, who initially identified Semiyarka two decades ago and co-authored the new report, \"but this collaboration has truly elevated our understanding of the site.\"",

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 A Stockholm court on Tuesday jailed four men for hate crimes for assaulting immigrants in a case that has shone a spotlight on a growing movement of white supremacist fitness clubs that some experts believe have their roots in California.",
      "The four men, aged 20 to 23, are members of an \"Active Club\" \u2014 loosely structured groups that meet in gyms and aim to promote white-nationalist, misogynist and hyper-masculine ideology.",
      "They were given prison sentences ranging from three to three-and-a-half years for aggravated assault after they beat up three men of foreign origin on Aug. 27 in Stockholm.",
      "The group first attacked a Black man with an umbrella while shouting racial slurs, prosecutors said. They then attacked a man of Syrian origin, knocking him to the ground and kicking him in the head until he lost consciousness and four teeth. Three of the four men then beat up a man on a subway train.",
      "\"The four men are of Swedish origin and have connections to Aktivklubb Sverige (AKS), which is considered a far-right organization with clear racist elements and which engages in martial arts,\" the court said in a statement. \"At least two of the men performed Hitler salutes during the night in question. All of the victims have an ethnic background different from the defendants.\"",
      "\"All of the crimes for which the men are convicted have hate crime motives, except for the vandalism,\" the court said, referring to neo-Nazi graffiti drawn on store windows.",
      "\"Intense hatred\"",
      "During the trial, prosecutors presented material seized from the four men, including notebooks with swastikas and stickers with the inscription \"Love Sweden, Hate Islam.\"",
      "The victims said they had been traumatized. The man attacked in the subway said he felt \"intense hatred\" as he was assaulted.",
      "\"I was beaten severely ... I didn't even have time to think before he took a running start and hit me with full force,\" he told the court.",
      "The victim beaten with the umbrella testified: \"It was as if these people knew what they were doing, that they were practicing kickboxing or something similar, that they were training to injure.\"",
      "The accused had denied the charges against them, save for the final assault, which was caught on security cameras. They claimed they acted in self-defense.",
      "The roots and rise of white supremacist \"active clubs\"",
      "According to the Swedish anti-racism watchdog Expo, \"Active Club\" members are encouraged to use violence outside the gym against targets including immigrants, feminists, Jewish and LGBTQ people.",
      "They \"hope to regain their masculinity by way of violence, improving their physical fitness and building a strong fraternity with other men who support each other,\" according to a document published by the Swedish Center for Preventing Violent Extremism.",
      "Sweden's intelligence service Sapo has warned of the risk of radicalization of young men attracted by violence and far-right groups like Active Clubs.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. legal advocacy group Southern Poverty Law Center said the prominent U.S. white nationalist hate group Patriot Front was using a network of \"Active Clubs\" across the country to boost its recruitment.",
      "Robert Rundo, the founder of a white supremacist group based in Southern California, is credited with introducing the idea of the clubs, according to the Anti-Defamation League.",
      "In 2021, Rundo started hosting a podcast called \"Active Club Podcast,\" on which he and his co-host encouraged listeners to establish clubs. He promoted something he called \"white nationalism 3.0\" \u2014 a more local, decentralized approach for the white nationalist movement in the U.S.",
      "Rundo was arrested in Romania in 2023 after the U.S. requested his extradition on federal rioting charges. He was sentenced to two years and effectively received a time-served sentence, being released in December 2024.",

      "The Ford arrived as the Trump administration moved to designate a purported drug-smuggling ring known as the \"Cartel de Los Soles\" as a foreign terrorist organization. President Trump said that designation could open the door to targeting assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela.",
      "Asked Monday if he would rule out sending American ground troops into Venezuela, Mr. Trump said: \"No, I don't rule out that. I don't rule out anything. We just have to take care of Venezuela.\"",

And being out there in truly God's country where we're just surrounded by just the wide open sea \u2014 it's beautiful. It's hard work, but I have a renewed appreciation for what my husband and so many others do. I knew it was hard work.

And it was so heavy and it was so hard. I mean, everything on my body, it was hurting and I recognized it's like, \u2018Wait a minute.\u2019 It's with many other sports and elements of life in business.

And you've got to be able to take in the elements, everything that's hitting you at once, and you have to act decisively and focus. So when the weather stirs up quickly and suddenly you've gotta change course quickly and you've gotta get a good course. And that's been a powerful lesson.\"",

    "story": [
      "GOP Rep. John Rose of Tennessee discussed his concerns with a measure in the bill to end the government shutdown that allows senators whose phone records have been tapped to sue the federal government.",
      "The Senate is once again finding a moment of bipartisan unity in its fury over a recently passed law that would allow lawmakers to sue the federal government and reap hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money as a reward.",
      "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle continue to grapple with the inclusion of a provision in a package designed to reopen the government that would allow only senators directly targeted by the Biden-led Department of Justice (DOJ) and former special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s Arctic Frost investigation to sue the U.S. government for up to $500,000.",
      "Both Senate Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 ire at the provision is multipronged. Some are angry it was tucked away into the legislative branch spending bill without a heads-up. Others see it as nothing more than a quick payday for the relatively small group of senators targeted in Smith\u2019s probe.",
      "REPUBLICANS FEUD OVER 'ARCTIC FROST' ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE, BUT CRITICS OFFER NO CLEAR ALTERNATIVE",
      "The Senate smashed through procedural hurdles and advanced its package to reopen the government, with the onus of ending the shutdown now falling on the House.\u00a0 (Tom Brenner/Getty Images)",
      "\"I think it was outrageous that that was put in and airdropped in there,\" Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., told Fox News Digital. \"It's outrageous. It's basically just a cash grab for senators to take money away from taxpayers. It's absolutely outrageous and needs to be taken out.\"",
      "The provision was included in the spending package by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on request from lawmakers in the GOP. And it was given the green light by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "The provision is narrowly tailored to include only senators and would require they be notified if their information is requested by the DOJ, be it through the subpoena of phone records like in the Arctic Frost investigation or through other means. The idea is to prevent the abuse of the DOJ to go after sitting senators now and in the future.",
      "Thune pushed back on the notion that lawmakers weren\u2019t aware the provision was in the bill, given that the entire package was released roughly 24 hours before it was voted on. But he acknowledged their frustration over how it was added was warranted.",
      "\"I think I take that as a legitimate criticism in terms of the process, but I think, on the substance, I believe that you need to have some sort of accountability and consequence for that kind of weaponization against a co-equal branch of the government,\" Thune said.",
      "Schumer, when asked about the anger brewing on both sides of the aisle, heaped blame on Thune but noted it was an opportunity to get protection for Democrats, too.",
      "GOP UNITY SHATTERED BY CONTROVERSIAL MEASURE IN GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN BILL",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced the bipartisan bill during a news conference Tuesday. (Valerie Plesch/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "\"Look, the bottom line is Thune wanted the provision, and we wanted to make sure that at least Democratic senators were protected from [Attorney General Pam] Bondi and others who might go after them,\" Schumer said. \"So, we made it go prospective, not just retroactive, but I'd be for repealing all the provision, all of it. And I hope that happens.\"",
      "The House is expected to vote on legislation that would repeal the language, and many in the upper chamber want to get the chance to erase the provision should it pass through the House. Whether Thune will put it on the floor remains unclear.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was one of the eight senators whose records were requested during Smith\u2019s probe. He told Fox News Digital he was neither asked about the provision nor told about it and, like many other lawmakers, found out about it when he read the bill.",
      "\"I just think that, you know, giving them money \u2014 I mean making a taxpayer pay for it, I don't understand why that's accountability,\" he said. \"I mean, the people who need to be held accountable are the people who made the decisions to do this, and, frankly, also the telecom companies. So I just, I don't agree with that approach.\"",

      "\"I could see the value of having a court say this was illegal and ruling against the government,\" Hawley said. \"I think it's the monetary provisions that most people, including me, really balk at. Like, why are the taxpayers on the hook for this, and why does it apply only to the Senate?\"",
      "The provision set a retroactive date of 2022 to allow for the group of senators targeted in Smith\u2019s Arctic Frost probe to be able to sue. That element has also raised eyebrows on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., told Fox News Digital he supported repealing the provision but wanted to fix it.",
      "\"The best way to be able to handle it, I think, is to be able to fix it, take away the retroactivity in it,\" he said. \"The initial target of this whole thing was to make sure this never happened again.\"",

And three times as many say Trump\u2019s economic policies have hurt them (they said the same about Biden\u2019s last year). Plus, approval of how Trump is handling the economy hit a new low, and disapproval of his overall job performance hit record highs among core supporters.",

      "\u2014 Views are divided on Trump\u2019s peace deals making the world safer and the administration\u2019s strategy for dealing with alleged drug-traffickers.",
      "Here are the numbers behind those findings.",

      "Eighty-six percent of Republicans approve, down from 92% in March.",
      "Among all voters, 41% approve of the job Trump is doing, while 58% disapprove. Only once have his ratings been lower and that was during his first term, 38-57% in October 2017. Two months ago, it was 46-54%.",
      "For comparison, Biden\u2019s marks were a bit better at the same point in his presidency: 44% approved and 54% disapproved in November 2021.",
      "Forty percent of voters rate their personal finances as excellent/good, while 60% say only fair/poor, which is about where things stood a year ago. Ratings are notably bad (roughly 70% negative), among non-college voters, Hispanics, Blacks, independents and those under age 45.

The new survey shows almost identical results, as voters say by a 31-point margin that Trump\u2019s economic policies have hurt rather than helped them, driven by the three-quarters of Democrats saying they have been harmed. In December 2018, during his first term, only 21% overall said they had been hurt by Trump\u2019s policies, including just one-third of Democrats.",
      "By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, voters say Trump is more responsible for the current economy than Biden (62% vs. 32%). Unsurprisingly, there\u2019s a large partisan gap, as Democrats are nearly 40 percentage points more likely than Republicans to blame Trump.

      "But it\u2019s Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer whose marks have deteriorated the most. A record low 22% view him favorably versus 54% unfavorably, for a net rating of minus-32 points. His ratings were underwater by 16 points in January. Among Democrats, positive views of Schumer went from 51% in January to 38% today.",

      "Trump\u2019s job ratings on foreign policy are underwater: 43% approve, while 55% disapprove. Yet views are more evenly divided on whether his recent peace deals will make the world safer or less safe (37% apiece), with one quarter saying not much difference.\u00a0And 49% favor the U.S. military using deadly force against presumed drug trafficking boats departing from Venezuela, while 47% oppose those efforts.",
      "The president receives his top marks on border security (53% approve). Nearly half approve of his handling of immigration (46%), while a new low approves on the economy (38%), and about one-third approve on tariffs (35%) and healthcare (34%).",

      "In a letter sent earlier this week, Tea Party Patriots Action urged the House Judiciary Committee to reject HR 1109, introduced by GOP Reps. Darrell Issa, Scott Fitzgerald and Mike Collins, which is known as the\u00a0Litigation Transparency Act of 2025.",
      "It's aimed at ensuring greater transparency in litigation, requiring parties receiving payment in lawsuits to disclose their identity.",

      "The letter warns that \"sweeping disclosure mandates in this bill threaten our core American principles of personal privacy, confidentiality, and freedom of speech and association.\"",
      "\"This legislation would require litigants to preemptively disclose detailed information about private financial arrangements, such as litigation funding agreements, independent from the discovery process and without any finding of relevance by a judge,\" the letter, signed by over a dozen conservative groups, including America First Legal, Defending Education, Heartland Institute and the American Energy Institute, states.",
      "The U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., Nov. 5, 2025.\u00a0 (Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "\"The bill\u2019s forced disclosure mandates would broadly apply to any number of political organizations, religious groups, law firms, or individual plaintiffs that rely on outside support to vindicate their rights.",
      "\"If adopted, H.R. 1109 will have a chilling effect on free speech and association and directly threaten the privacy rights of Americans,\" the letter warns. \"The end result will be fewer Americans having the resources or willingness to bring legitimate claims, which threatens to undermine future legal battles over issues critical to our movement.",
      "\"The privacy interests at stake here are not abstract. We have seen how disclosure regimes can be easily weaponized by bad actors, particularly those seeking to attack and intimidate political opponents.\"",
      "Issa told Fox News Digital Wednesday afternoon there is \"misinformation\" circulating about what the bill actually proposes to do, and there will be a \"small update tomorrow to clarify one item.\"",
      "\"What's actually happened is language has been put in to assure groups that we're not looking to overturn NAACP v. Alabama or any of the other historical 501(c) privileges that you don't turn over your donor list and so on,\" Issa said. \"That was something that Obama and Biden tried to do a couple of times. We want nothing to do with that. We're only asking that if there is a material funder slash partner in a lawsuit, that they be disclosed.",
      "\"I fully respect and appreciate the concerns of people who want to make sure that this does not turn into a burdensome discovery of, for example, a nonprofit's hundreds, thousands or millions of donors.",
      "PALANTIR CEO CLAIMS COMPANY IS FIRST TO BE 'COMPLETELY ANTI-WOKE,' BACKS TRUMP ADMIN'S BOMBING OF DRUG BOATS",
      "\"We share the concern of all these groups that we wanted to make sure we believed we were on solid ground as written, but in an abundance of caution, my staff and all the parties worked to try to come up with the most straightforward, effective way to say, of course, you don't have to disclose your donors.\"",
      "Proponents of the legislation, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, call it a \"vital step toward ensuring that our legal system remains a tool for justice rather than being a playground for hidden financial interests.\"",
      "In his press release announcing the legislation in February, Issa said,\u00a0\"Our legislation targets serious and continuing abuses in our litigation system that distort our system of justice by obscuring public detection and exploiting loopholes in the law for financial gain.",
      "\"Our approach will achieve a far better standard of transparency in the courts that people deserve, and our standard of law requires. We fundamentally believe that if a third-party investor is financing a lawsuit in federal court, it should be disclosed rather than hidden from the world and left absent from the facts of a case.\"",
      "The press release explained that hundreds of cases a year involve civil cases funded by undisclosed third-party interests as an investment for return from hedge funds, commercial lenders and sovereign wealth funds through shell companies and that there are often investor-backed entities who seek hefty settlements from American companies that end up \"distorting the free market and stifling innovation.\"",
      "The conversation about the legislation reignites an ongoing showdown between insurers and large corporations that have made the case that third-party funding drives abusive suits and inflated settlements. Some argue there's a need for more transparency about those who fund litigation and for limits to speculative investment in lawsuits against\u00a0advocacy-oriented nonprofits and legal networks. Those groups argue they are the only mechanism for those without deep pockets to take legal action against well-funded companies.",
      "Many advocacy-oriented nonprofits and legal networks simply don't hand over charitable donations to a lawsuit. Instead, they use structured litigation vehicles, limited liability companies, donor-advised funds or legal defense trusts that front the costs of a case and are reimbursed, sometimes with interest, if the case wins or settles. The process is known as non-recourse or outcome-contingent funding, meaning the investor only gets money back if the case succeeds.",

And the group\u2019s executive director, Will Hild, told Fox News Digital it has been \"all too easy for major companies to use their outsized influence and powerful market shares to push an ideological agenda with little to no recourse.\"",
      "Hild told Fox News Digital he views the legislation as an \"attack\" on one of the \"few tools Americans have to hold powerful, woke corporations accountable.\"",
      "Hild added, \"Even worse, it imposes dangerous disclosure mandates that would force plaintiffs to expose confidential litigation funding agreements. This bill blatantly tips the scales in favor of woke corporations and makes it far harder for victims to secure the resources they need to fight back.\"",
      "The letter from the conservative groups also expresses fear that \"compelled disclosure of private financial arrangements would force litigants to unveil the identity of donors \u2014 violating donor privacy rights and exposing them to threats of harassment and retaliation.\"",
      "In a\u00a0Tuesday op-ed in The Hill opposing the legislation, Alliance Defending Freedom founder Alan Sears pointed to Supreme Court decisions he says have \"affirmed that forced disclosure of private association undermines fundamental freedoms.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, Rep. Fitzgerald said, \"As reiterated to these groups in multiple discussions, it remains Congress\u2019 intent to protect the First Amendment rights of those who contribute to political groups and religious organizations, consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Citizens\u2019 United.\"",
      "Organizations that have endorsed the bill have pointed to concerns about foreign funding in courtrooms, specifically from China, including High Tech Investors Alliance, which said in a press release it commends the legislators who put it forward for \"defending American businesses against the exploitation of our courts by foreign adversaries and unscrupulous hedge funds.\"",
      "\"For too long, a lack of transparency has allowed shell entities to manipulate the legal system to prey on American employers, concealing their predatory practices and identities of their financial backers,\" HTIA said. \"As President Trump takes bold action against aggressive economic maneuvers by China and other countries, Congress must also act decisively to protect our judges and juries from becoming tools in the economic warfare waged by antagonists.\"",

      "The House Judiciary Committee did not mark the bill up Tuesday, and Fox News Digital is told it will be marked up on Thursday at 12 p.m.",

      "He added the legislation does not require materials to be turned over to the defendant, and a judge can review them in private.",
      "Issa continued, \"We just want to make sure that the judge knows that just as the markman is a required part of determining what a patent means, that it's a responsibility of the judge to determine who the litigants are and, as appropriate, disclosing them is required. And that last part has always been ignored a little bit. We're only making sure that that discovery is asked for and evaluated at a minimum by the judge or magistrate overseeing the case.\"",

      "Affordable Care Act subsidies might expire in 2026, but Obamacare always has included costly provisions, one expert says.",
      "Americans are bracing for their healthcare premiums to increase in 2026 amid uncertainty stemming from whether Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies about to expire at the end of 2025 will receive an extension.",
      "Those shopping on the ACA marketplace already are expected to face a 26% premium price increase in 2026, and if the potential government subsidies expire, monthly payments for subsidized patients could increase by 114%, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation released in October.",
      "But the potential lapse in government subsidies, which seek to lower monthly payments for patients, isn't the only reason for rising premium prices. At the crux of the issue is that the ACA\u2019s foundation includes several inflationary provisions that are driving up healthcare costs, according to experts.",

      "1. Guaranteed coverage",
      "One provision included in the ACA is the guaranteed issue, which requires that insurers provide coverage to anyone without factoring in their health status or age.",
      "This is a factor that ramps up the cost of premiums, according to Sally Pipes, the president of the free market think tank Pacific Policy Institute.",
      "\"As older patients use a lot more healthcare than the young and cost insurers a lot more in claims, premiums have to rise to cover their loss on the older enrollees,\" Pipes said in a statement Monday to Fox News Digital.",
      "2. Community rating rule",

      "REPUBLICANS TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO BASHING OBAMACARE AS SHUTDOWN ENTERS DAY 39",
      "This essentially amounts to a system of government price controls because it requires insurance companies to charge two people of the same age on the same healthcare plan the same premium, even if one is healthy and the other is sick, according to Cannon.",
      "\"That is a price floor for the healthy person, because the price can't go below whatever you charge the sick person, and it's a price ceiling for the sick person, because the price can't go above whatever you charge the healthy person,\" Cannon said. \"And so the centerpiece of Obamacare is really just price controls, where you set the price too high in one area and too low in the other area.\"",
      "3. Mandated service coverage",
      "Additionally, the ACA has an \"essential\" health benefits requirement that stipulates health insurance plans must cover certain services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, mental health services, prescription drug coverage and more.",

They add tremendously to the cost of coverage.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over extending ACA subsidies, ultimately prompting the government shutdown, which lasted more than 40 days and was the longest in U.S. history. Democrats refused for weeks to back a measure without a provision to permanently extend the ACA subsidies, which will expire at the end of 2025.",
      "Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over extending Affordable Care Act subsidies.\u00a0 (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)",

      "Every year, they target holiday shoppers with fake websites, \"too-good-to-be-true\" deals and scam emails that look identical to legitimate retailers. But here's the part most people miss: scammers don't just rely on luck. They already have your personal data before you even click \"add to cart.\"",
      "From leaked email addresses to exposed phone numbers and home addresses, your personal information is being bought and sold by data brokers, companies that collect and resell detailed profiles about you. Those profiles are exactly what scammers use to send realistic \"order confirmations,\" fake delivery alerts and \"urgent payment\" texts during this holiday period and beyond.",

      "Why scammers love the holiday season",
      "November through December is a goldmine for cybercriminals. According to the CISA, reports of online shopping scams spike during this time of year and vary in their approaches. The reason? We let our guard down when we're rushed, distracted or excited by a deal. Staying alert during the holiday season can help you avoid data exposure and financial losses. Here are some of the most common scams you should be aware of.",
      "The surge of promotions during the holiday season is the perfect time for \"phantom stores\" to thrive. It's a fraudulent store that mimics the interface and products of a well-known brand. Once you purchase from such a website, you'll never receive your order as the store doesn't actually exist.",
      "Real-world example: Fake IKEA websites appeared with URLs spelled \"ikeaa-sale.com\" and \"ikea-blackfriday.shop,\" mimicking the official ikea.com interface with copied product images, logos and discount banners.",
      "They lured shoppers with huge discounts and clearance offers to steal credit card data. Eventually, they were reported and taken down, but the damage has been done.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Always check the URL of the store you shop at and only click links from the store's official website or social media.",
      "According to recent research, some of the most popular shopping apps like Temu are selling your location data to third parties. It's no surprise that you might receive fake delivery texts.",
      "Your leaked data fuels realistic \"order\" and \"delivery\" scams online. (iStock)",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "Real-world example: Temu is a popular app for scammers to mimic. They can easily find your contact information and order details to text \"Your order couldn't be delivered.\" Each text contains a phishing link that can install malware on your device or steal your personal information. That's why Temu warns its users about the couriers they partner with.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Make sure the texts you receive come from a legit courier service and double-check it on the store's website.",
      "Some scammers use sophisticated phishing tactics to lure victims. They engineer emails from well-known brands, use an urgent tone, place malicious links and urge you to click on your order status. In reality, there is no order status \u2013 they're stealing your data.",
      "Real-world example: Amazon is one of the biggest online retailers worldwide, and that makes the brand easy to mimic. Scammers send emails on behalf of Amazon to try to steal customers' personal data because it's highly likely that their victims have used Amazon, making it less suspicious. However, phishing emails have some telltale signs you can look out for.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Never click on any suspicious links and always check the sender's contact information.",
      "When you shop online, you should be aware of the data you share, including your contact information, shopping habits, credit card details and more. All stores collect some type of data about you. However, some companies collect more than you think.",
      "Real-world example: The infamous Target controversy in 2012 revealed how big retailers use data analysis to predict your shopping behavior. The company collected shopping data and managed to produce a predictive model for soon-to-be mothers.",
      "They sent out brochures with baby clothes, vouchers for baby formula and more before the customers even knew they were pregnant. Thankfully, modern shopping looks a bit different. You can opt out of certain data collection and exercise your right to remove personal information from websites that collect it.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Check what data the stores collect about you and request the removal of any private information you don't want them to have.",
      "THE TRUTH BEHIND THOSE MYSTERIOUS SHIPMENT EMAILS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "How scammers find you",
      "Imagine you're browsing for gifts online. Within minutes, your activity generates data points \u2013 device info, IP address, browsing habits that feed into online databases. At the same time, data brokers already have your full profile: age, income, address history, family members and even shopping behavior. These profiles are sold to marketers and often leak into criminal databases.",
      "That's why scam calls, texts and emails often feel so \"real.\" They use your name, the right retailer, even your city. They're not guessing. They've bought your digital footprint.",
      "The \"holiday cleanup\" your data needs",
      "Most people clear their browser cookies or delete old emails to \"stay private.\" But that's like locking your front door while leaving all your personal documents on the lawn.",
      "If you want to stop scammers from targeting you this holiday season, you need to remove your personal data from the source, the data broker databases that feed these scams.",
      "That's where a data removal service comes in. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who leads a bipartisan group of 23 lawmakers, warns that TP-Link cameras and networking devices sold on Army, Navy and Air Force exchange sites could expose sensitive footage from base housing and dorms. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, echoed that concern, saying these devices could act as a backdoor for Chinese intelligence to collect information on service members and their families. Even when products appear out of stock, officials worry they remain popular in military communities.",
      "These lawmakers say Chinese laws could force companies to share data or push hidden software changes that weaken U.S. networks. They argue that this creates a real risk for households on or near military installations. While TP-Link disputes every allegation and states that it stores U.S. data inside America, lawmakers want a deeper investigation.",
      "\"China will use any way to infiltrate us, and we must ensure they cannot access our homeland or military bases,\" said Ernst. \"High-tech security cameras sending video and audio directly back to Beijing must be treated like the grave threat that they are. We have seen this playbook from China before, with Huawei Technologies, and need the Trump administration to investigate and determine if TP-Link is a Trojan horse compromising our national security.\"",
      "10M AMERICANS HIT IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR DATA BREACH",
      "How Congress is responding to TP-Link security risks",
      "Ernst is pressing the Commerce Department to finish its investigation by Nov. 30. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, says TP-Link could give the Chinese government access to American networks and wants faster action. Their concerns reflect past decisions involving Huawei and Kaspersky, which lost access to the U.S. market due to national security risks.",
      "Congressional leaders say foreign-made smart home devices sold on military bases should face strict scrutiny. They see routers, cameras and other connected home gear as critical targets in a time when cyberthreats continue to grow.",
      "We reached out to TP-Link Systems Inc., and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"TP-Link Systems Inc. (TP-Link), an American company based in California, refutes the claims in this letter. This letter repeats false and misleading media reports and attacks that have been thoroughly debunked.\"",
      "\"TP-Link emphatically objects to any allegation it is tied to the Communist Party of China, dependent on the Chinese government, or otherwise subject to interference under Chinese national security laws,\" the TP-Link spokesperson said. \"The company is not controlled by any government, foreign or domestic. TP-Link has split from and has no affiliation with the China-based TP-LINK Technologies Co. Ltd., which is separately owned and operated.",
      "Lawmakers warn that TP-Link devices sold on military bases may put service members and their families at greater risk, especially inside base housing. (John Moore/Getty Images)",
      "\"This letter has nothing to do with security and everything to do with a competitor trying to remove TP-Link Systems\u2019 products from the marketplace. The \u2018open source information\u2019 the members reference is actually a manufactured echo chamber of false and misleading attacks that the media has parroted over the past year. Instead of directly engaging with TP-Link Systems, these members essentially pressed \u2018copy and paste\u2019 on unsubstantiated claims about our American company.",
      "\"TP-Link has not been contacted by policymakers to discuss the alleged concerns, but if we were to meet with them, they would learn that TP-Link has located its core security functions and data infrastructure in the United States. U.S. user data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services infrastructure in Virginia, under the full control of the company\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "\"TP-Link Systems currently holds a very small share of the U.S. security camera market, representing approximately 3% of the consumer market segment according to Circana checkout data. The company has virtually no business presence in the enterprise segment. Additionally, TP-Link Systems' router market share in the U.S. has been inaccurately reported as being much higher than it actually is. Recent market research from Dell\u2019Oro Group, Inc., found that TP-Link Systems' market share of residential Wi-Fi router sales in North America is under 10%.",
      "\"TP-Link does not enable foreign surveillance of U.S. networks or users. The company\u2019s operations are built to prevent potential attempts to subvert its business by outside influence. TP-Link\u2019s substantial security investments cover its entire product portfolio, including security cameras and routers.",
      "\"TP-Link continually monitors its products and services and takes timely and appropriate action to address vulnerabilities it becomes aware of. TP-Link has not identified any reliable information regarding new vulnerabilities in its products in connection with this letter.\"",

      "According to the statement provided to CyberGuy, the breach was limited to employment-related information tied to Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America.

      "Why this Hyundai AutoEver America breach matters",
      "The exposed data reportedly includes names, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers, making this breach far more serious than one involving passwords alone. Experts warn that these details can be used for long-term identity theft and financial fraud. Because Social Security numbers cannot easily be changed, criminals have more time to create fake identities, open fraudulent accounts and launch targeted phishing attacks long after the initial breach.",

      "According to the company, this incident was limited to employment-related data and primarily affected approximately 2,000 current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. No customer information or Bluelink driver details were exposed. While some filings reference sensitive data types such as Social Security numbers or driver's license information, the incident did not involve Hyundai customers or the millions of connected vehicles HAEA supports.",
      "Earlier reports suggested that 2.7 million individuals were affected, but Hyundai says that figure is unrelated to the breach. Instead, 2.7 million is the estimated number of connected vehicles that Hyundai AutoEver America helps support across North America. None of that consumer or vehicle data was accessed.",

Approximately 2,000 primarily current and former employees were notified of the incident. The 2.7 million figure that is cited in many media articles has no relation to the actual security incident.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A Skagit County Superior Court judge ruled that images from Flock Safety automated license plate reader cameras in Stanwood and Sedro-Woolley qualify as public records under Washington's Public Records Act.",
      "Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski said the images are \"not exempt from disclosure\" and explained that an agency does not need to physically hold a record for it to fall under the law.",
      "The request that led to the ruling",
      "The case began when Washington resident Jose Rodriguez asked Stanwood for one hour of Flock camera images. That request prompted Stanwood and neighboring Sedro-Woolley to ask the court to declare that vendor-stored data did not count as public records.",

      "We reached out to Flock Safety, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"The Court merely declined to exempt these records from disclosure under Washington's extremely broad public records law. Nothing changed in the status quo in Washington as a result of this ruling \u2014 these records were covered by the law before the ruling, and remain so following the ruling. Unfortunately, some individuals in Washington have abused the breadth of the public records law to extort significant settlements from Washington communities for technical violations of the disclosure requirements, which we cannot believe is the intent of the law. We are supporting efforts to enact a legislative fix to this situation, which is costing Washington communities tens of thousands of dollars to stave off frivolous lawsuits.\"",
      "The Washington court ruling marks a major step toward transparency in how police collect and store surveillance data. (Flock Safety)",
      "Why the decision matters for transparency",
      "Flock's automated license plate reader cameras capture multiple still images of passing vehicles along with time, location and license plate information. Cities use the system to assist law enforcement with investigations, relying on stored images to identify vehicles connected to crimes or alerts.",
      "The court's ruling raises broader questions about how local agencies manage these images once they're created. By finding that the images qualify as public records, the decision forces cities to examine how long they retain this data, how it is stored and who may request access under state law.",
      "Privacy advocates say the ruling highlights the need for clear policies around retention and transparency, while law enforcement groups argue that access rules must still protect ongoing investigations.",
      "AI DASHCAMS ENHANCE TRUCKER SAFETY WHILE RAISING PRIVACY CONCERNS",
      "The debate continues as communities weigh the balance between public safety, privacy and the right to know what\u2019s being recorded. (Flock Safety)",
      "How this ruling impacts privacy and surveillance",
      "For years, cities and police agencies have argued that data stored by third-party vendors falls outside public records laws. They often make this claim even when the data documents activity on public roads. The Washington ruling did not settle broader questions about surveillance, but it rejected the idea that Flock camera images are exempt simply because a vendor stores them. This decision exposes a growing tension between how agencies use surveillance tools and what the public can access under state law.",
      "Beryl Lipton of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to defending digital privacy, free expression and transparency in technology, told Cyberguy,\u00a0\"The use of third-party vendors for surveillance and data storage is widespread and growing across the country, and allowing this to undermine the public\u2019s right to know is very dangerous. The government's primary obligation should be to its constituents, which includes protecting their rights under public records laws, not to the private vendors that they choose to employ while conducting mass surveillance. Whether an agency stores images and information on their own devices or on the private server of a vendor should not affect the appropriate disclosure of these records under public records laws. If the use of these devices makes it too difficult for a city to comply with the law, then the response should not be to circumvent the laws they find inconvenient, but rather it should be to only use vendors that won\u2019t get in the way of a city\u2019s ability to fulfill its responsibilities to their citizenry. Otherwise, they should not use these tools at all.\"",
      "What this means for you",
      "If your town uses Flock or other automated license plate readers, this ruling shows how Washington courts may handle future records requests. It confirms that ALPR images can count as public records, even when a vendor stores the data.",
      "The debate over privacy and safety continues. Supporters say public access builds trust and oversight. Critics worry that releasing vehicle data could expose sensitive details without strong safeguards or redactions.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This ruling shows how courts may handle data from automated license plate readers. It also reveals how much vehicle information cities collect. As a result, it raises new questions about who should access these records. In addition, the decision may guide future transparency debates in Washington.

      "But instead of activating anything, the PowerShell command connects to a remote domain named slmgr[.]win, which downloads harmful executables from Cloudflare-hosted pages.

      "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) can take a serious toll on families, not only emotionally but financially, especially when every cycle comes with new bills and no clear sense of what the full journey might cost. Gaia Family aims to change that by removing the guesswork around pricing with a blend of tech and AI-driven forecasting.",
      "Instead of worrying about unpredictable costs, couples pay a fixed upfront price or monthly installments that cover their planned IVF treatment, medications, embryo transfers and built-in protections if cycles or transfers aren't successful. It gives families a clearer path forward and support that lasts through the entire process.",

      "Artificial intelligence is giving hopeful parents more clarity about their chances over multiple IVF cycles, helping them plan their journey with clearer expectations instead of guesswork. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Gaia Family was born",
      "Gaia Family was founded by Nader AlSalim, a former Goldman Sachs executive who knew the IVF struggle firsthand. After spending over $50,000 across five IVF rounds in multiple countries, he and his wife finally had a son. The experience left him frustrated by how little clarity the system offered and how emotionally draining the process could be.",
      "He saw that most fertility systems were built around procedures, not people. His goal with Gaia Family was to build something different, a program that uses data to empower families instead of leaving them to navigate uncertainty and mounting debt. That personal experience became the foundation of Gaia Family's mission to bring agency, transparency and compassion to fertility care.",

      "Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",
      "If a cycle doesn't result in viable embryos, Gaia's built-in protection covers another attempt, helping families try again without financial shock. Once you have viable embryos, your Gaia Plan allows you unlimited frozen embryo transfers (usually $5,000 each) at no extra cost until you have a baby. And, if none of those transfers result in a live birth, then Gaia will give you money toward another cycle. Plus, you have the option of including all of your PGT-A testing and your medication for a fixed cost, so you have even more protection throughout your journey. AlSalim, tells CyberGuy the company's mission goes beyond technology.",
      "\"At Gaia Family, we're using AI not to replace the human element of fertility care, but to bring more confidence to it,\" AlSalim said. \"Fertility treatment can feel like a game of chance \u2014 our technology helps turn it into a guided, informed journey. By analyzing millions of data points, we can forecast the most effective and affordable pathway for each individual, so patients can make decisions grounded in data rather than uncertainty. Ultimately, it's about giving hopeful parents more agency, transparency and peace of mind in one of the most emotional experiences of their lives.\"",
      "SKIN DNA BREAKTHROUGH COULD LET 60-YEAR-OLD WOMEN HAVE GENETICALLY RELATED KIDS",
      "For many couples, this combination of data and compassion is transforming uncertainty into confidence and renewed hope. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Gaia Family's model matters",
      "IVF in the United States can cost as much as $30,000 per cycle, and most couples need several tries. Each failed attempt adds more bills and stress. Gaia Family's fixed-cost model gives families financial predictability while keeping them emotionally supported. It also encourages clinics to focus on outcomes rather than repeated treatments.",
      "This approach is transforming how people view fertility care. Instead of relying on luck, families can benefit from AI insights to make better decisions. While it may not lower the medical costs yet, it changes how couples experience one of life's most emotional challenges, turning fear into informed planning and despair into hope. Gaia removes the spiraling costs, making couples' outcomes so much more cost-efficient.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are thinking about IVF or egg freezing, Gaia Family's model could make your path more manageable. It provides upfront transparency about costs, protection against financial loss and a data-driven forecast of success. It helps you make decisions based on evidence rather than guesswork.",
      "Still, while AI can analyze data patterns, it cannot alter biology. Factors like age, health and genetics continue to shape outcomes. Even so, Gaia Family's system gives couples a sense of control that traditional fertility care rarely provides by serving everyone, with no eligibility criteria in terms of age or health factors. Knowing that your finances are protected can ease stress and allow you to focus on what matters most: building your family.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

      "Some states are already laying the groundwork for this new era. Minnesota and New Hampshire have passed legislation formally recognizing \"roadable aircraft,\" making them the first states to treat flying cars as both vehicles and aircraft under state law. Pennsylvania now hopes to follow their lead with its own version through Sen. Marty Flynn's Jetsons Act.",
      "At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun approving real-world tests. In 2023, the FAA granted a special airworthiness certificate to SpaceX-backed Alef Aeronautics for its Model A prototype, allowing it to operate on roads and in the air for research and development. That approval marked the first time a flying car received official clearance for combined ground and flight testing in the United States.",
      "Sen. Flynn wants Pennsylvania to be part of this growing national conversation. In his co-sponsorship memo, he explained that proactive legislation will help the state prepare for the next wave of innovation.",

      "The Alef flying car is made of ultra-light material, allowing it to fly and travel on roads. (Alef Aeronautics)",
      "How the Jetsons Act would work",
      "Under Senate Bill 1077, Pennsylvania would officially define a \"roadable aircraft\" as a hybrid vehicle capable of both driving and flying. These vehicles would need to register with the state, display a unique registration plate and meet standard inspection requirements. When operated on highways or city streets, they would be subject to the same rules as other vehicles. When used in flight, they would remain under federal aviation oversight.",
      "The bill also clarifies how drivers and pilots must transition between ground and air operations safely. It allows take-offs and landings only in approved areas, except during emergencies. Flynn emphasizes that clear definitions and consistent oversight will prevent confusion for both motorists and law enforcement. He hopes this clarity will also encourage manufacturers to consider Pennsylvania a test site for future flying car technologies.",
      "CHINESE AUTO GIANT WANTS TO MAKE FLYING CARS YOUR NEXT COMMUTE OPTION",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Pennsylvania, this bill could one day change how you think about personal transportation. While flying cars remain in development, legislation like this sets the stage for their eventual arrival. Drivers may one day register, inspect and insure a flying car just like a regular vehicle. Pilots could use the same roadways to reach take-off zones before switching to flight mode.",
      "Even for residents who never plan to own a flying car, the ripple effects could be significant. New rules may influence local zoning, airspace management and infrastructure planning. Communities might see new vertiports or designated landing pads as part of urban development. Insurance companies and safety regulators will need to rethink how they handle this new class of hybrid travel.",
      "The bill also signals a broader change in how states approach innovation. Rather than waiting for federal action, Pennsylvania wants to establish a framework that welcomes new technologies while protecting public safety.",

      "Sen. Flynn's Jetsons Act might sound futuristic, but it reflects a growing reality in transportation. As autonomous vehicles, drones and hybrid aircraft evolve, state governments must adapt to keep up. This legislation shows Pennsylvania's willingness to lead rather than follow. While it may take years before you see a flying car parked in your driveway, the groundwork is already being laid. Lawmakers are thinking ahead about licensing, safety and how to integrate flying cars into existing traffic systems. That forward-thinking approach could one day make Pennsylvania one of the first states to see cars take to the sky.",

      "This fake Geek Squad invoice looks professional, but small red flags, like a generic greeting, expose the scam. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the scam works",
      "The scam depends on fear and confusion. Once you call the number, the person on the line sounds polite and professional. They might say they need to verify your payment or reverse a charge. In reality, they are trying to get your credit card number or convince you to install software that gives them access to your computer.",

The moment I saw that \"Payment order settled\" email, I realized something was off because I don't even have a Geek Squad account. That alone was a major red flag. If you ever get a message about a service you never signed up for, delete it right away. Instead of calling the number in the message, go to the official Best Buy or Geek Squad website to confirm if there is a real issue with your account. Also, sign up for strong antivirus software. Antivirus software acts as your digital guard. It scans downloads, detects malicious links and warns you before dangerous sites load. Choose a trusted program that updates automatically and includes email protection features. This extra layer of defense can prevent malware from taking hold if you accidentally click something suspicious.",

      "If someone contacts you claiming to be from Geek Squad or Best Buy, stay calm and skeptical.

      "Old software is one of the easiest ways for hackers to slip in. Keep your operating system, browser and security programs updated. Turn on automatic updates so you do not have to think about it. These patches often close known security holes that scammers exploit.",
      "Before reacting to any invoice or payment alert, go straight to the official account or service mentioned, such as Geek Squad, PayPal, Amazon or your bank. Log in directly through their website or app to verify the details. If nothing shows up there, the email is a scam. This quick step can save you from a costly mistake.",
      "Reporting suspicious emails helps stop scammers from targeting others. Most email services, including Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo, allow you to mark messages as phishing.

      "Conduent discovered the intrusion in January 2025 and said hackers had infiltrated its network as early as Oct. 21, 2024. During this period, attackers reportedly stole large amounts of data linked to state-level programs such as Medicaid, child support, food assistance and toll systems. Conduent claims that its investigation found no ongoing malicious activity and said operations were safely restored after the breach was contained.",

      "In January, Conduent described the event as an \"operational disruption caused by a third-party compromise.\" The breach led to several days of downtime, disrupting vital services in multiple states. In Wisconsin, for instance, parents and beneficiaries were unable to process payments due to system outages, leaving many struggling to meet obligations related to child support and welfare programs.",
      "The SafePay ransomware group later claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging it had stolen 8.5 terabytes of data. Conduent confirmed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that hackers had indeed exfiltrated files belonging to a limited number of clients. The company says it hired cybersecurity experts to analyze the stolen data and recently confirmed that it contained significant amounts of personal information from end-users across multiple programs.",
      "Despite the massive theft, Conduent said there is currently no evidence that the stolen data has been published online or on dark web marketplaces.",

      "\"Upon discovery of the incident, Conduent acted quickly to secure its networks, restore its systems and operations, notify law enforcement and conduct an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensics experts. In addition, given the nature and complexity of the data involved, Conduent has been working diligently with a dedicated review team, including internal and external experts, to conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information contained therein, which was a time-intensive process.

Data exfiltration on this scale has long-term implications, from identity theft to potential fraud within public benefit systems. The real test will be how both Conduent and its government partners adapt their cybersecurity oversight to prevent similar breaches. Because at this point, the question isn't whether these systems will be targeted again, but whether they'll be any better prepared when it happens.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/texas-startup-raises-5-5m-revolutionary-solar-towers-produce-50-more-energy",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 07:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Texas startup Janta Power raises $5.5M for innovative vertical solar towers that generate 50% more energy than traditional panels while using just one-third the land.",
    "story": [
      "As AI data centers use more electricity, the solar industry is ramping up to provide more power.",
      "Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.",
      "Why flat solar panels are no longer enough",
      "Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.",
      "Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.",
      "Janta Power\u2019s 3D solar towers capture more sunlight throughout the day while using just a third of the land. (Janta Power)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How Janta's solar towers work",
      "Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.",

      "Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.",
      "Stronger, smarter and more efficient",
      "Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.",
      "Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.",
      "A game-changer for energy economics",
      "The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.",
      "That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.",
      "Built to endure 170 mph winds, Janta\u2019s modular towers are already powering airports in Munich, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and across Aena\u2019s global network. (Shelby Tauber/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "CHINESE-MADE SOLAR PANELS USED ON AMERICAN FARMS PUTS US POWER GRID AT RISK: FORMER NSA OFFICIAL",
      "What this means for you",
      "For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.",
      "For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Janta Power's vertical tower design and intelligent tracking system show what happens when creativity meets clean energy. The company's technology makes it possible to generate more power from less space, setting a new standard for solar innovation.",
      "Smart tracking software automatically pivots each tower from sunrise to sunset, boosting efficiency by up to 50% compared to traditional flat panels. (REUTERS/Dane Rhys)",

      "Florida Congressman Byron Donalds is calling for a federal crackdown on sanctuary-state policies that allow illegal immigrants to obtain commercial drivers licenses after a joint ICE and Oklahoma Highway Patrol operation arrested 70 illegal immigrants, including 34 accused of driving big rigs while in the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "\"You have blue states that do not care about the nation's laws. They want to be sanctuaries, they want to house illegals, and then who pays the price are citizens in red states who actually do not want these sanctuary policies,\" Donalds, a Republican, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Donalds said the incident in Oklahoma underscores a growing national safety risk \u2013 foreign nationals who \"cannot read our road signs\" yet are \"gaming the system\" to obtain commercial licenses in states like California, Illinois, New York and New Jersey.",
      "\"You have the American people, they're doing the right thing, and now they're subject to losing their lives or being in an auto accident with a CDL driver who cannot read our signs, who doesn't know our laws,\" he said. \"These commercial driver\u2019s license operators [are] driving rigs that are 80,000 pounds.

      "Donalds said legislation he has introduced, the WEIGH Act, would give the federal government new tools to stop states from issuing CDLs to illegal immigrants and to punish those that do.",
      "\"This is one of the reasons why I sponsored the WEIGH Act here in D.C.,\" he explained. \"It would actually give broader authority for the Department of Transportation to not just hold other states accountable that are letting these CDL licenses be issued, but would also give the Department of Treasury the ability to withhold federal funds in the process.\"",
      "\"If you actually penalize these states for allowing this behavior, they'll then have to turn around and fix it on their end,\" Donalds said. \"And that's how you save lives of the American people.\"",

      "Ahead of the meeting, a group of 9/11 survivors, first responders and victims\u2019 families urged President Donald Trump to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for its alleged role in the 2001 attacks.

Daniels, ruling against Saudi Arabia's efforts to dismiss a lawsuit brought against it by the families of 9/11 victims, which alleged the country was party to the attacks.",

Thanks to our Dealmaker-in-Chief, the United States secured $600 billion in historic investments during the President\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year, and Americans can expect more good deals for our country spanning technology, manufacturing, critical minerals, defense, and more.\"",
      "A senior administration official, speaking on background, told Fox News Digital that the expected agreements will include a multibillion-dollar investment in America\u2019s AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and defense sales aimed at strengthening defense cooperation between the two countries.",
      "The official added that the visit will also focus on the fulfillment of the Saudis\u2019 $600 billion investment pledge through dozens of targeted investments across key U.S. sectors.",
      "In Saudi Arabia, the visit is being seen as historic. Aziz Alghashian, a lecturer in international relations at Naif Arab University in Riyadh, said there is \"a lot of excitement. The Saudis have said they\u2019re not isolated in the region\u2026 this is back through open doors and the front door again.\" He said the moment reflects a broader shift in how Saudis understand their country\u2019s place in the world. According to Alghashian, Trump\u2019s repeatedly warm comments about the crown prince and the kingdom also contribute to a sense that Riyadh is re-entering Washington on strong footing.",
      "The visit by MBS will be his first White House appearance since the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which U.S. intelligence assessed he approved, a charge he denies.",

      "At the heart of the visit is the emerging U.S.-Saudi security pact. Alghashian described its purpose in three words: \"elevate, facilitate and consolidate.\"",
      "In his view, the agreement is meant \"to elevate the Saudi-American relationship,\" transforming it from what he called a \"strategic partnership\" into a more formalized security alignment. Although not a full treaty, which Riyadh had previously pursued, the pact would still represent the most significant upgrade to the relationship in decades. He said the shift also has a domestic political rationale in Washington, arguing that being included in an \"alliance\" category \"helps make Saudi Arabia become more of a bipartisan issue, and not just necessarily a Trump legacy.\"",

      "That urgency extends to nuclear cooperation, where Saudi Arabia has made clear that while China and South Korea exist as alternatives, its preference is for an American program. \"Saudi Arabia really wants American nuclear cooperation because it adds more security,\" he said, adding that Riyadh will not \"wait forever\" if conditions become overly restrictive but sees the current U.S. posture as an opening.",

He recalled hearing a senior Saudi official say recently that \"there will be no regional integration without Palestinian statehood,\" a line that reflects the kingdom\u2019s long-standing public position that recognition of Israel will only come after a credible pathway to a Palestinian state is in place.",
      "Still, Olidort said full Saudi-Israel normalization may not be necessary at this moment for U.S. priorities to advance. He said normalization \"doesn\u2019t need to be the immediate priority\" and suggested that \"an upgraded deepening of cooperation, but short of full normalization,\" could be possible if both sides see value in closer security integration.",
      "TRUMP SECURES DEALS WITH 3 MIDDLE EASTERN NATIONS IN 1ST MAJOR TRIP OF 2ND TERM",
      "That perspective is particularly relevant given the war in Gaza and Riyadh\u2019s position on reconstruction.

      "Trump\u2019s decision to approve F-35 sales to Saudi Arabia adds another layer. Saudi Arabia has formally requested up to 48 of the fifth-generation jets, making it the largest potential F-35 buyer outside NATO and the first Arab state after the United Arab Emirates to receive them. The move would test Washington\u2019s commitment to maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge.",
      "Olidort, however, argued that the sale does not automatically threaten Israel\u2019s superiority. \"I don\u2019t know that it will mean Israel losing air superiority,\" he said, noting that Israel\u2019s defense and aerospace sectors are \"world-class\" and that the sale could \"potentially deepen collaboration between Israel and Saudi Arabia and make each of our partners\u2026 more effective.\"",

      "Analysts expect the September report to show a gain of 50,000 jobs in the month, as cost-of-living issues and reduced consumer spending crimped companies\u2019 hiring plans.",
      "While that would be an improvement from the 22,000 jobs added in August, it would remain well below the 2024 average monthly total of about 168,000.",
      "Scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, Thursday\u2019s report was originally supposed to be released Oct. 3, but it was shelved because of the government shutdown. Jobs data collected for October will be released Dec. 16 as part of the full report covering November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday.",
      "The absence of official economic reports over the past six weeks has made it difficult to accurately assess the current state of the jobs market.",
      "But data from private and alternative sources paints a worrisome portrait amid signs of softening consumption among many households and still-stubborn price increases.",
      "About 39,000 workers received layoff notices in October, according to data tracked by the Cleveland Federal Reserve \u2014 a number last seen in May and before that only during times of crisis.",
      "A separate report released this month by the research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas counted 153,000 job cuts announced in October, though some analysts give less weight to its data over methodology questions.",

      "Tiffany Price, South Florida general manager for Job News USA, a job listings service, said many companies face budget cuts and have effectively frozen hiring.

      "The number of employers who attended a recent Job News jobs fair at Amerant Bank Arena in Broward County, Florida, was nearly half the figure of a year ago, while attendance among workers held steady at about 2,000 potential applicants, Price said.",
      "Still, many organizations report difficulties finding qualified workers, she said. On both the employer and the employee sides, a \u201cpost and pray\u201d job application strategy has taken hold that leads to worse outcomes for both, she said. More successful outcomes on both fronts have come from local relationships and face-to-face outreach.",
      "A bright spot has been local government, Price said \u2014 something that is reflected in the national data, which shows employment in local government roles has continuously expanded since the Covid-19 pandemic recovery set in.",

      "The Fed is watching",
      "Questions about the health of the labor market now dominate discussions about whether the Federal Reserve should continue to cut interest rates. On Monday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said a December cut was needed to stem further job-market deterioration.",
      "\u201cMy focus is on the labor market, and after months of weakening, it is unlikely that the September jobs report later this week or any other data in the next few weeks would change my view that another cut is in order,\u201d he said.",
      "In his speech last month announcing a 0.25% rate cut, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was more circumspect, saying it appeared that the jobs market was weakening only gradually and signaling he was not ready to guarantee a December rate cut was inevitable.",
      "The Fed\u2019s divisions were laid bare in meeting notes released Wednesday from the October rate-setting meeting that showed a sharp split among policymakers about the risk that lower rates would spur already-elevated inflation by making it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow money.",
      "\u201cMost participants noted that, against a backdrop of elevated inflation readings and a very gradual cooling of labor market conditions, further\u201d interest-rate cuts \u201ccould add to the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched,\u201d the notes said.",
      "So far, many economic analysts have been reluctant to call it a full-blown jobs crisis, pointing to data from state-level claims for unemployment that remain subdued and recent reports from the payrolls processor ADP showing a slight rebound in new hires.",
      "\u201cFears of a renewed labour market downturn, amid reports of mass layoffs at several large firms, are not reflected in still-muted jobless claims or the pick-up in hiring in the ADP private payrolls report,\u201d Thomas Ryan, North America economist for Capital Economics research group, wrote in a note published last week."

    "summary": "NBC News spoke to roughly 20 voters in Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's district about her disagreements with Trump.",
    "story": [
      "ROME, Ga. \u2014 Not many Republican politicians have dared criticize President Donald Trump \u2014 and a few bold souls who\u2019ve tried have seen their careers collapse.",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is now facing the president\u2019s wrath, but in a sign of broader fissures within the MAGA movement, she just may survive the blowback, interviews with about 20 of her constituents suggest.",
      "Once an unflinching Trump loyalist, Greene now faults him for spending too much time on meet-and-greets with foreign leaders when many people at home are struggling to pay bills.",
      "\u201cPeople in my district are having a very hard time,\u201d she told NBC News in a recent interview.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that many voters are feeling a little disenfranchised because the domestic issues have not been the priority,\u201d she added.",
      "Trump, in turn, is angry about her apostasy. He pulled his support for her and has signaled that he\u2019d be open to endorsing a Republican challenger to her in the 2026 midterm congressional elections.",
      "He\u2019s called her a \u201ctraitor\u201d and said she is \u201cwacky,\u201d a \u201clunatic.\u201d",
      "Greene has bristled over what she calls his \u201cvicious attacks\u201d and worried that they are \u201ca dog whistle to dangerous radicals that could lead to serious attacks on me and my family.\u201d",
      "All of which leaves voters in northwest Georgia feeling a bit like a heartsick family swept up in an unexpected divorce.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not right,\u201d Debbie Dyer, 60, said of Trump\u2019s accusation. \u201cShe should not be seen as a traitor. She\u2019s trying to do the best for the American people and I think Donald Trump should accommodate her and work for America.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe has a lot of courage and tells it like it is,\u201d added Dyer, who lives in Dalton, near the Tennessee border, and works at a carpet company.",
      "Greene's office did not return a request for comment for this article.",
      "Greene\u2019s 14th Congressional District likes Trump, but it likes her, too. Greene often eats at the Blossom Hill restaurant, with her \u201cgo-to\u201d sandwich being the \u201cAngry Pig\u201d (pulled pork, jalape\u00f1os and fried onions served with a choice of sides).",
      "Trump won her district in the 2024 presidential race with 68% of the vote; Greene won re-election with 64%. Virtually everyone interviewed has heard about the feud between the president and the congresswoman. Who goes with mom; who stays with dad?",
      "\u201cSome people are struggling with it. Some are choosing Team Marjorie, and some are Team Trump,\u201d said Angela Dollar, a local Republican official in Floyd County, part of Greene\u2019s district."

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 02:32:09 GMT",
    "summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The senior military lawyer for the combatant command overseeing lethal strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela disagreed with the Trump administration\u2019s position that the operations are lawful \u2014 and his views were sidelined, according to six sources with knowledge of the legal advice",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The senior military lawyer for the combatant command overseeing lethal strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela disagreed with the Trump administration\u2019s position that the operations are lawful \u2014 and his views were sidelined, according to six sources with knowledge of the legal advice.",
      "The lawyer, who serves as the senior judge advocate general, or JAG in military parlance, at U.S. Southern Command in Miami, raised his legal concerns in August before the strikes began in September, according to two senior U.S. officials, two senior congressional aides and two former senior U.S. officials.",
      "His opinion was ultimately overruled by more senior government officials, including officials at the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, the six sources said. Other JAGs and military lawyers at various levels of seniority weighed in on the boat strikes, as well. It\u2019s unclear what each of their opinions were, but some of the military lawyers, including civilians and those in uniform, also expressed concerns to senior officials in their commands and at the Defense Department about the legality of the strikes, the two senior congressional aides and one of the senior former U.S. officials said.",
      "The JAG at Southern Command specifically expressed concern that strikes against people on boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean, whom administration officials call \u201cnarco-terrorists,\u201d could amount to extrajudicial killings, the six sources said, and therefore legally expose service members involved in the operations.",
      "The opinion of the top lawyer for the command overseeing a military operation is typically critical to whether or not the operation moves forward. While higher officials can overrule such lawyers, it is rare for operations to move forward without incorporating their advice.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement: \u201cThe War Department categorically denies that any Pentagon lawyers, including SOUTHCOM lawyers, with knowledge of these operations have raised concerns to any attorneys in the chain of command regarding the legality of the strikes conducted thus far because they are aware we are on firm legal ground. Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in complete compliance with the law of armed conflict.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Southern Command referred questions to the Defense Department, which the Trump administration calls the War Department. A spokesperson for the White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The JAG is Marine Col. Paul Meagher, according to three people familiar with the matter. Attempts to reach Meagher for comment were unsuccessful.",
      "The strikes on alleged drug boats have drawn support from Republicans, as well as criticism from members of both parties, NBC News has reported.",
      "The opinion of the Southern Command JAG, which has not been previously reported, adds a new dimension to concerns that lawmakers, retired military officers and legal experts have raised about the administration\u2019s legal justification for striking alleged drug boats.",
      "Those concerns have centered on questions about whether the strikes violate international and U.S. law.",
      "Since Sept. 2, it says, the administration has killed 82 people in 21 strikes on small vessels it says were transporting drugs bound for the United States.",
      "Administration officials have not put forward any specific evidence backing up their claims.",
      "The administration has told members of Congress that President Donald Trump determined the United States is in \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartel members, NBC News has reported. The administration designated some drug cartels in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations this year.",
      "Trump has argued that drugs from the region pose a significant threat to American citizens. He has linked the boats to fentanyl to argue that the military strikes have saved tens of thousands of American lives, although fentanyl is typically smuggled into the United States by land across the Mexican border. Cocaine, which is most often moved via sea, is considered far less lethal than fentanyl.",
      "JAGs' opinions on possible military operations are usually shared with higher authorities, including the Defense Department\u2019s general counsel, Justice Department officials and ultimately the White House, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the process.",
      "JAGs typically play an integral role in defining the legal parameters of any military operation, and often their collective advice would be the primary guiding principle as political leaders decide whether to take such action, according to the current and former U.S. officials familiar with the process.",
      "In the Trump administration\u2019s campaign against alleged drug boats, politically appointed lawyers at senior levels have often defined the legalities of the operations with minimal lower-level legal input, according to the two senior congressional aides and one of the former senior U.S. officials.",
      "There have been other signs of disagreement within the administration over the strikes. The head of Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey, plans to step down after less than a year in a job that typically lasts about three years.",
      "Holsey announced in October that he will depart next month.",
      "In addition to concerns about the legality of the strikes, Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have complained that the administration has not provided them enough information about the legal rationale or the intelligence used to target the vessels and people the administration purports are bringing drugs into the United States.",
      "\u201cThere is no world where this is legal,\u201d said a current JAG, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Congress has not declared war or authorized the use of military force against the drug traffickers, and U.S. law allows the president to take military action without lawmakers\u2019 approval only if there is a national emergency due to an attack on the country or American forces.",
      "Dan Maurer, an associate professor of law at Ohio Northern University and a former Army JAG, argued that the drug cartels\u2019 narcotics smuggling and other actions are crimes but do not qualify as an armed attack on the United States as defined by U.S. and international law.",
      "\u201cThese drug cartels may be violent, they may be aggressive, they may be transnational,\u201d Maurer said in an interview. \u201cThey may be doing terrible things within their own countries; they may be importing terrible things into our country that have bad consequences. But all of those are crimes, and none of which meets the traditional meanings of an attack or invasion.\u201d",
      "Maurer and other former military lawyers and experts believe the Trump administration\u2019s legal rationale for the strikes is so tenuous it could put commanders and troops in legal peril after Trump leaves office in 2029.",
      "Trump administration officials have defended the legality of the strikes and argued that they have shared ample information about them with members of Congress.",
      "The legal debate about the strikes is likely to intensify if Trump decides to hit targets inside Venezuela, as he has threatened to do. The current legal rationale for strikes on vessels does not apply to any strikes on land, a senior administration official told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing last week, according to two additional congressional aides.",
      "Some of the military\u2019s strikes on boats have killed people who critics of the operations say may be noncombatants or even immigrants who are hitching rides on the vessels and have nothing to do with the drug trade. Two survivors of a strike were captured and repatriated to Colombia and Ecuador rather than taken into U.S. custody, a decision that one of the congressional aides said raises questions about whether there is sufficient evidence to prosecute them for a crime.",
      "The internal differences over the legality of the boat strikes echo a similar debate more than 20 years ago. During President George W. Bush's administration, senior military lawyers for the Army, the Air Force and the Marines raised objections over proposed \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques in 2003 and later testified to Congress about their concerns. They warned that U.S. courts could find those techniques amounted to torture and were illegal.",
      "John Yoo, the controversial legal architect of Bush\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, now argues the Trump administration\u2019s boat strikes risk crossing the line between \u201ccrime fighting and war.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmericans have died in car wrecks at an annual rate of about 40,000 in recent years; the nation does not wage war on auto companies,\u201d he wrote recently in an op-ed in The Washington Post. \u201cAmerican law instead relies upon the criminal justice or civil tort systems to respond to broad, persistent social harms.\u201d"

      "On Season 7, Episode 5, of \u201cThe Kardashians,\u201d Kardashian revealed that doctors found an aneurysm in her brain, which alarmed her sister Kourtney Kardashian Barker.",
      "\u201cI did a prenuvo scan and they called me today and they\u2019re like, \u2018Everything looks great, but you have an aneurysm in your brain,\u2019 and they\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s been there for years.\u2019 It was here two years ago,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "According to Mayo Clinic, an aneurysm is \u201ca bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel\u201d and can form in several parts of the body. A ruptured aneurysm can cause bleeding inside the body, which can result in death, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "While talking to her sister, Kardashian said that doctors told her that an aneurysm can be ruptured by stress. The Skims founder explained that she\u2019s been under a lot of it lately studying for the bar exam and has developed hives because of it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely worried about Kim. She has so much going on between work and her four kids that I don\u2019t want her to have an aneurysm, of course,\u201d Kardashian Barker said in a confessional.",

      "\u201cI can\u2019t believe that she has to relive it,\u201d Kardashian Barker said in a confessional.",
      "Due to everything her sister has been dealing with, Kardashian Barker asked Kardashian why she feels the need to study for the bar right now.",
      "\u201cI wonder why she feels the need to go to law school and do this. It\u2019s fine if it\u2019s your passion and whatever, but isn\u2019t there a time to do it later when your kids are more grown and they don\u2019t need you as much?\u201d Kardashian Barker asked.",
      "However, Kardashian said that she can\u2019t pause her studies because she\u2019s close to finishing her law program, which she completed in May, and is also \u201caddicted to studying.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just look at things differently. I love that my kids see me go to school,\u201d she said in a confessional. \u201cWhen I drop them off at school, they see me go to school. I enjoy that. It\u2019s like I love educating myself. I just wouldn\u2019t feel like myself if I wasn\u2019t learning and trying new things. That\u2019s just what I like to do. We\u2019re all totally different.\u201d",
      "Though Kardashian Barker said that she has a different viewpoint on life, the Skims founder said that she\u2019s going to try her best not to stress, especially after she learned that someone had \u201cput a hit out\u201d on her life.",
      "After completing her law program in May, Kardashian revealed she failed the California bar exam in a Nov. 9 TikTok video.",
      "The reality TV star also opened up about how stressful her life can be in a preview clip for Season 7 of \u201cThe Kardashians\u201d that aired during Episode 1.",

      "In a move no one saw coming, Trinity graciously sacrificed his own game to allow the other finalists to continue on in the competition. Then things got real. The remaining four contestants had to compete in a game of \"Red Light, Green Light\" with Young-hee, an animatronic doll from the show.",

      "During the game, another contestant tried to make Perla feel guilty by reminding her she was playing for her son at home. The emotional manipulation didn't sit well with Perla.",
      "\"As an empath, it was really hard because obviously I do care that you have a dream and a reason to be here, but I think it\u2019s very unfair (to act that way). I have a lot of friends in the show that had kids and never threw it in anyone\u2019s face. So it was really tough,\" she said.",

      "\u201cI will definitely buy my mom a house. That has been her dream since we all moved to America and it\u2019s really hard to get a house in America. So that would be No. 1,\" she said. \"And then, you know, get a boob job.\""

I have amicably resolved my legal dispute with the Quintanilla family,\u201d he tweeted at the time. \u201cNow that these issues are behind us, going forward, my hope, and the hope of the Quintanilla family, is for us to work together to continue to honor and celebrate the legacy of Selena.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez, who appears alongside Selena\u2019s family members in the \u201cSelena y Los Dinos\u201d docuseries, has remained close to his sister-in-law and former bandmate Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "The two posed together under a mural of Selena last month in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cLike everything, family has disagreements about certain things, but we\u2019re past that,\u201d Suzette Quintanilla told E! News this month during a joint interview with P\u00e9rez. \u201cI will always consider Chris family, and I know that he feels the same way about me, and that\u2019s it.\u201d",

      "The guitarist said the love he shared with Selena is still precious to him.",
      "\u201cAs time has gone on, you romanticize it even more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe love story is a big part of her legacy. My most prized possessions are her love letters.\u201d He reads one of her letters in \u201cSelena y Los Dinos.\u201d",
      "He added in his People interview that the pain of Selena\u2019s death still haunts him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Chris before all of that happened, and Chris after,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe\u2019s a part of both sides. I\u2019ve lived with her presence in thoughts and feelings and music. That\u2019s become my new normal. But I can\u2019t watch the end of the documentary about her death. It\u2019s just difficult.\u201d",
      "What Does Chris P\u00e9rez Say About Selena in \u2018Selena y Los Dinos\u2019?",
      "In the Netflix documentary, P\u00e9rez says he was \u201cstarstruck\u201d when he met Selena and her band.",
      "\u201cThe honest truth was I was just more taken aback by the power of the band and the music and the sound,\u201d he said, before touching on his early relationship with Selena. \u201cAt first, we didn\u2019t hang out too much. Selena was always either off with Suzette or her mom.\u201d",
      "He credited the long tour bus trips to them becoming friends.",
      "\u201cAnytime we were next to each other, it would just be me and her talking about music and movies and things like that,\u201d he said, admiring how it was \u201ccool seeing her being a normal person.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez also commented on Selena\u2019s \u201cvulnerable side,\u201d as well as spoke about their trip to Mexico as a band when he started to have stronger feelings for her.",
      "He recalled their first kiss, as well as when their bandmate Ricky Vela walked in on them. P\u00e9rez also said he was \u201cgenuinely in fear\u201d of Selena\u2019s father and what he would say.",
      "\u201cBut what we had going with each other, I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that at all,\u201d he said.",

      "Selena\u2019s widow also touches on the day he found out she died.",
      "\u201cI do miss her a lot. But today, I\u2019m very proud of what she represents and the small part that I might play in that story,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "It wasn't until her junior year of college that Nia Sioux realized she was ready.",
      "Then a student at UCLA, she was in Los Angeles with her mom, Holly Frazier. She remembers looking at her and saying, \"I'm ready to write it.\"",
      "She was referring to her long-planned dream of writing a memoir about her time on the Lifetime reality show \"Dance Moms.\" Nia  was just 9 years old in the show's pilot. She and her mom, Holly Frazier, starred in it for seven seasons, from 2011 to 2017.",
      "That dream was actualized with the release of \"Bottom of the Pyramid: A Memoir of Persevering, Dancing for Myself, and Starring in My Own Life,\" which hit shelves Nov. 4.",
      "\"I always knew I was going to write a book about my time on 'Dance Moms,'\" Nia tells TODAY.com. \"But it's ever really been the right time. It never really felt right. I don't even think I was really comfortable talking about everything that happened on the show. I was still processing it.\"",
      "The book opens with her casting on the show, and each chapter unveils her side of some of the show's controversial moments, often with her dance teacher and the show's star, Abby Lee Miller, at the center of it. She alleges Miller made racist comments directed at her, tried to bribe a mentor to not work with Nia and most recently, refused Nia's request to visit Miller in the hospital to clear the air after she was diagnosed with cancer. (TODAY.com has reached out to Miller for comment.)",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com after the publication of the memoir, Nia confirms she hasn't heard from Miller about the book.",
      "\"I don't plan on getting anything either,\" Nia says. \"Yeah, no.\"",
      "But bringing that to light isn\u2019t why Nia wrote the book. In the memoir, she writes that after her request to meet was declined, she\u2019ll \u201cnever reach out to Abby Lee Miller again.\u201d She adds that she \u201cdidn\u2019t even want to use her name\u201d in the book.",
      "\"After I had a lot of space away from the show, I realized that that woman really does not have power over me. She really can't dictate my life and control things, and for so long, she made it seem like she controlled the world and she controlled my future,\" Nia says. \"I think having that space away from the show and realizing, like, oh my gosh, actually, she doesn't exist in my world. I can do my own thing and be successful ... and she's not going to get in the way of that.\"",
      "The book seeks to establish Nia as the \"star in my life.\"",
      "Its overarching theme is ironically best described by the title. The bottom of the pyramid, of course, refers to \"Dance Moms'\" episode's fixture in which Miller would rank each dancer in a tiered pyramid based on their performance at their most recent competition.",
      "Fans of the show may remember that typically Nia was toward the bottom, while the coveted top of the pyramid spot was most often dominated by Maddie Ziegler.",
      "\"My dad, at first, was a little concerned. He loved the title, but he also was concerned with it, because I've been trying to kind of shed that title my whole life,\" Nia says. \"So he was like, 'Why would you name your book \"Bottom of the Pyramid\"? Isn't that kind of putting yourself down?'",
      "\"I was like, 'No, it's basically me just reclaiming that title and turning it into a positive,'\" she adds.",
      "For example, she writes in the book, as the bottom of the pyramid she served as her team's base, its glue. And \"at the bottom, the only place you can go is up.\"",
      "\"I'm not shying away from it. I'm not embarrassed by it. I'm just ready to talk,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "But that doesn't mean it was easy. She says the most difficult part was \"trying to tell my story\" while \"not trying to put other people down.\"",
      "\"Anytime I do bring up the girls and situations, I think that part was the hardest for me to write because I never want to paint them in a bad light,\" she says. \"But it's still my experience, and it's still very valid.",
      "\"My relationship with the show was very complicated,\" she adds. \"Although there were times where it was really negative and really challenging, at the same time, it's how I got my start. It's something that is a part of me, and it's something I'm still grateful for, with the good and the bad.\"",
      "Below, Nia discusses how she approached writing the memoir, how some of her fellow castmates have reacted and why the book feels like \"closure\" for the \"Dance Moms\" chapter of her life.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "The hardest part for me was making sure that I wrote everything in the way that I wanted it to be taken. I think that it's really difficult to talk about these sort of things because I come from a place of, you know, I'm healed. I always lead with love. At the same time, I'm not trying to put people down or badmouth anybody. So, trying to find that delicate balance between sharing my story, but (I'm) still not here to protect people. People have been protected this whole time. It was time for me to share my story. And I think that was the hardest part for me, is being OK sharing my story without being worried about what other people thought.",
      "I always knew that I endured a lot. But I feel like every time I read through the book to make my edits and add things, omit things, every single time something came up. Every single time I think I cried in different moments. It's really healing to see your whole story as something tangible, as a book. Literally reading your whole life \u2014\u00a0it's very therapeutic. It's basically my diary; it's like my journal. But it's been so healing. And I think that's the thing that I was so surprised about. It did bring up emotions. I was like, you know what, this might be hard for me to write, and there were times that were hard to write, but for the most part, it was just so healing.",
      "I did. Not every single episode, but the parts that I talk about in the book, I watched it back. I remember things a certain way, and I know how things went down, but I also needed to see how they played out on television to see what the world saw. Sometimes it was the same thing that I remembered. ... But there were a lot of things also that I remember that did happen that the show either cut out or they clipped a certain way.",
      "That was kind of weird, because in my head, I'm like, \"Oh, I thought people knew this.\" I thought it played out this way, but actually, they didn't show any of the stuff I actually went through that week. So watching it back, I mean, I did honestly get irritated at times. I'm like, \"Oh my goodness, they didn't show any of that.\" Watching it, what, 14, 13 years later, having that realization is kind of crazy.",
      "I think I watched the first few episodes of it. When it first came out we had our launch party. ... We watched the first episode when it came on, and I think maybe I probably watched the next couple.",
      "But if I'm being honest, no. One because I don't want to re-live that, I know what happens. But then also, too, I honestly really couldn't. We had no time to even watch anything. The time that the show came out, Tuesdays at 9, we literally had dance. I was at dance while the show was coming out. I would get home and the credits would be rolling. So yeah, even if I wanted to, I couldn't, really.",
      "Chloe did read it before it came out, but I didn't really talk to anyone else about the book before I announced that I was doing it. Chloe was my main girl for that because I knew that she would one, be understanding, and also I really wanted her to write the forward. And she was so excited about it. It was a very special moment when I asked her. I had her obviously read the book before she committed to writing the forward as well. Because, of course, I wanted her to be comfortable with what she was endorsing. She's been so great during this whole process, and I'm really proud of her. And I also know that she's proud of me, and it's been a very special journey.",
      "My mom, actually both my parents, would read chapters as they were done. Any parts I had done, I would have my parents read it, because I value their opinion a lot. They watched every episode and they were the adults, so they would probably remember more than me at times, and then remind me of things. That really helped, trying to get different points of view, making sure that I don't forget the little things.",
      "The book definitely feels like closure. I think before I wrote the book, I had definitely moved on. But I don't know if I really had closure with it because I had never talked about my experience. Not many people actually heard from me when it came to \"Dance Moms.\" So this really was healing. This really was closure. And I also say, this book is also a love letter to my younger self.",
      "Honestly, I feel like there hasn't been a ton from the cast members, reaction-wise. So I don't know whether that's good or bad, but like, I haven't seen too much about that. But I'm grateful for the people that have supported me. Grateful for my mom continuing to support me, grateful for Chloe.",
      "... Having her support means the absolute world because I know that I don't have support from everyone. So it's nice to have somebody, especially Chloe, be so supportive of my story.",
      "Well, my biggest dream is one, to help people. That's what I feel like is my mission, just to help people in any way I can. But also I'm a performer at the end of the day, so storytelling, in any way possible, whether that's through dance, music, acting, theater. Theater was my first love besides dance. So hopefully \u2014 well, not hopefully, I am \u2014\u00a0I'm going to dive back into all of those things.",
      "Now that I'm done with college and now I'm done writing the book and it's released now, I can finally focus on getting back into the swing of things. Before I went to college, I was kind of on a roll, and then I went to college, COVID happened, the actors strike happened. So a lot of things have changed within the past five years. So I'm excited to get back to it. I've been craving getting back to performing, getting back on stage, in any capacity."

You need somebody that you can trust 100%. I know Liz always has my back.\u201d",
      "Executive produced by retired cheerleading coach Monica Aldama (\u201cCheer\u201d), NBC\u2019s new mockumentary \u201cStumble\u201d centers on the indomitable coach Courteney Potter (Jenn Lyon) and her quest to win her 15th championship cheer title.",
      "When she is abruptly fired from her Texas team at Sammy Davis Sr. Junior College (SDSJC), she vows to find and train a new squad \u2014 even if that means driving 80 miles to an Oklahoma junior college with a name she can\u2019t even pronounce and enlisting a team of misfits, including a kleptomaniac, a 30-something car salesman and a student with narcolepsy.",
      "\u201cCourteney is a bit of a mess, but a controlled mess,\u201d Jeff Astrof says. \u201cShe is super driven and loves these kids, which Jenn is such a natural at \u2014 she brings so much heart and pathos to the character.\u201d",

      "Part of what grounds Courteney is her high-school-sweetheart husband and personal cheerleader Boon E. Potter (Taran Killam), who now works as a football coach after suffering a career-ending head injury.",

      "\u201cWhat I loved about Coach Taylor and Tami was that they fought and bickered, but you never worried they were going to break up,\u201d said Liz. \u201cThey were supportive and loving but could also have those serious and heartfelt conversations that can leave you choked up at the end.\u201d",
      "As with any underdog story, you need a rival. For Courteney, that\u2019s Tammy Istiny (Kristin Chenoweth), her former cheer assistant who often dresses as though she\u2019s about to be called to the mat at any moment. Upon the news of Courteney\u2019s firing, Tammy does not follow her to Oklahoma, but rather, smiles with glee any time she hears of Courteney\u2019s struggles.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time the writers collaborated with Chenoweth. Jeff Astrof co-created the NBC legal sitcom \u201cTrial & Error\u201d with Matt Miller back in 2017, which Chenoweth starred in. When it came to the role of Tammy, the siblings knew it had to be Chenoweth.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have done the character without her,\u201d Jeff Astrof says. \u201cThat\u2019s a big reason we shot in New York. It was so important for us to have access to her. Everything we can do to put her in more, we do.\u201d",
      "Even though Courteney\u2019s new cheer family may be more unconventional than her former elite squad, it doesn\u2019t mean the stunts have to suffer. In fact, choreographing impressive cheer routines was a crucial element throughout making the series.",
      "The writing duo recalled a time when they were nervous that one of the flyers was going to hit the ceiling, but the cheerleaders reassured them not to worry because they have control over their bodies, even in the air.",

      "The prosecutor in the singer\u2019s trial argued that Selena\u2019s killing was not accidental, according to the 1998 court document.",
      "In an interview with \u201cBehind the Music\u201d in 1998, Sald\u00edvar opened up about her relationship with Selena throughout the early \u201890s, and explained why she had founded a fan club devoted to the singer.",
      "\u201cGoing through my college years, I had no social life. I had none because I devoted myself to my university, my career, my license,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it was time for me to have fun.\u201d",
      "Selena\u2019s father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr., also shared his earlier memories of Sald\u00edvar in the \u201cBehind the Music\u201d special.",
      "\u201cAt one time, my whole family liked Yolanda,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would invite her to come eat at our house. We\u2019d have a get together, and we\u2019d invite her.\u201d",
      "Sald\u00edvar said her connection to Selena \u201chad grown from being just a fan-celebrity type to this personal type of relationship.\u201d",
      "In her 1995 \u201c20/20\u201d interview, she also said that Selena sometimes even called her \u201cmom.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was like a cuddly bear, teddy bear, that \u2014 she would allow you to love her,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said. \u201cI told her that I loved her like a daughter. And she goes, \u2018You know, I give you that right.\u2019 She would call me \u2018mom\u2019 on the phone.\u201d",
      "The singer\u2019s family questioned whether Selena ever called Sald\u00edvar \u201cmom,\u201d according to \u201c20/20.\u201d",
      "In the 2024 trailer for the Oxygen documentary \u201cSelena & Yolanda: The Secrets Between Them,\u201d Sald\u00edvar seemed to suggest that she has previously undisclosed information to share about the circumstances of Selena's death. (Oxygen is owned by NBCUniversal, the parent company of TODAY.com.)",
      "\u201cMy family gathered the evidence, showed different versions of what was going on,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said in the trailer.",
      "What Did Yolanda Sald\u00edvar Say in the Oxygen Docuseries?",
      "The three-part series, which aired in Feb. 2024, featured new interviews with Sald\u00edvar, as well as interviews with prosecutors, the hostage negotiator who spoke to Sald\u00edvar after Selena\u2019s death, and police detectives who were on the scene in the aftermath of the murder, according to Oxygen.",
      "In the series, Sald\u00edvar claimed she did not intentionally kill Selena and dismissed the long-held theory that she was embezzling money. Instead, Sald\u00edvar alleged that Selena was having an extramarital affair and tasked Sald\u00edvar with making purchases on her behalf to help cover up the tryst. Sald\u00edvar said she was simply paying herself back and that Selena was aware. But in the docuseries, Sald\u00edvar did not provide any evidence to substantiate her claims.",
      "\u201cAfter so many years, I think it\u2019s time to set the story straight,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said in a trailer for the series.",
      "\u201cI knew her secrets,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said later in the trailer. \u201cAnd I think that people deserve to know the truth.\u201d",
      "Selena\u2019s family slammed the docuseries for giving Sald\u00edvar a platform.",
      "\u201cNo one\u2019s gonna believe what she has to say anyway. Everyone knows there\u2019s zero truth to anything that comes out of her mouth,\u201d Abraham Quintanilla Jr. told TMZ.",
      "Selena\u2019s family declined to participate in the docuseries. At the time of its release, NBC News reached out to the family\u2019s spokesperson, as well as Abraham Quintanilla Jr. directly, for comment regarding Sald\u00edvar\u2019s claims."

    "story": [
      "Thirty years ago when Selena Quintanilla died, the world lost a rising star \u2014 and a groundbreaking artist.",
      "The Mexican American singer, known as the Queen of Tejano music, was just 23 years old when she was murdered by the president of her fan club and employee Yolanda Sald\u00edvar in 1995.",
      "The Texas native captivated audiences in the U.S. and Latin America with her hits \u201cComo La Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido\u201d and \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom.\u201d Her signature red lips, long black hair,  sultry voice and beloved dance moves have become iconic for fans of the late artist.",
      "Many who were unfamiliar with Selena during the height of her fame became aware of her extraordinary talent when Jennifer Lopez portrayed her in the 1997 biopic, \u201cSelena.\u201d",
      "Now, for the first time since Selena\u2019s death, her family is sharing never-before-seen footage from their archives of the superstar and her rise to fame in Netflix\u2019s \u201cSelena Y Los Dinos,\u201d streaming now.",
      "\u201cYou get to hear from Selena herself. We went through every single interview that we could find and that exists,\u201d director Isabel Castro tells TODAY.com. \u201cWe wanted to hear as much from Selena throughout the film as possible because we felt that, in that way, we would be telling the story in her voice.\u201d",

      "While many are familiar with the lead singer, the film chronicles how she started her career as part of her family's musical group Selena y Los Dinos. The band included her sister playing drums and her brother playing bass, backing vocals and writing songs, along with a slew of band members like Ricky Vela and Pete Astudillo. Her future husband later joined the group as a guitarist.",
      "\u201cI understand what Selena and her legacy represent even now, 30 years later,\u201d Suzette Quintanilla tells TODAY.com \u201cAnd I also know that's growing.\u201d",
      "Below, Suzette Quintanilla and Isabel Castro chat with TODAY.com about the decades of footage they combed through for this project \u2014 and the painful emotions and moments of joy that resurfaced after 30 years.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "Suzette Quintanilla: I had reached out to Isabel about two years ago or so. With social media, things get blurred, and stories get told one way \u2014 and then they start changing. I wanted to be able to take our family story and what we created as a whole... and bring it to 2025, leaving this really nice capsule of our story, told by \u2014 who better than our family?",
      "That\u2019s pretty much why I wanted to do this, and I thought maybe sharing some footage of us back in the day would be really good. Isabel has a fun story about how I let her into the vault. We call it the vault at the office, but it's basically where we keep all our footage.",
      "Isabel Castro: The vault is actually the perfect way to describe it, but it's floor to ceiling bookcases with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of VHS tapes, beta cam, film, CDs, flash drives.",
      "We spent two years going through all of that, logging everything, digitizing everything, watching every single thing. We watched every single piece of footage.",
      "SQ: I didn't feel differently. If anything, it gave me that good feeling of how life was. I was telling Isabel, like, \u201cOh, my God, I saw some of the footage, and I remember I was whistling when she bought those shoes\u201d or...different little key moments like clothing. Because we were sisters, we would shop a lot together.",
      "But what I did walk away with was, I had a really good feeling of like, \u201cWow, I know we worked really hard.\u201d It was a reminder of what we did come from, which was nothing, and that we created something memorable that still resonates with people. I\u2019m very grateful that our music is still relevant to this day.",
      "One of the things that I\u2019m really proud about this documentary is it truly tells and showcases the importance of each one of us and what we bring to our band. Yes, clearly Selena was a star and she was the forefront of our band. But there were other main factors that made our vision. I think that Isabel was able to really showcase the magnitude of what we each brought, and that\u2019s why we are here talking about our documentary.",
      "IC: That was one of the main goals of the film, to obviously explain how Selena became the symbol and the icon. But the film itself, I wanted it to feel as personal and as close to the family as possible, because my theory was that that was going to be what made it different from anything that had been made before. That was our North Star in the editorial process: to try to find ways to really make it as personal as possible.",
      "There's so many decisions that went into trying to cultivate that intimacy. We filmed people in spaces that they spent a lot of time in so they felt really comfortable. We didn't clean up the archive, we made sure that the edges and the glitches and the focusing of the camera and zooming in and out, those things were all kind of integrated into the editing process. And though these seem just like creative elements, they lend itself to the film feeling as if you're getting to know a more personal side of Selena.",
      "The other thing is that you get to hear from Selena herself. We went through every single interview that we could find and that exists. We transcribed every single interview and we wanted to hear as much from Selena throughout the film as possible because we felt that in that way, we would be telling the story in her voice as well.",
      "SQ: We\u2019ve never tried romanticizing anything about our life, I don\u2019t know if everybody else might have done that. But in regards to what we have always done is just kept it real. Isabel had so many things to go through to be able to create and integrate Selena into this film because that\u2019s the heart of this whole documentary. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s stripped down. There\u2019s no romanticizing going on. It\u2019s just who she was.",
      "What's relevant is, whenever you see an interview of her, she'll say something and she just starts laughing at herself. Most artists don\u2019t do that. They\u2019ll be like, \u201cNo, don\u2019t show that.\u201d And for her, she didn\u2019t care. It was just her being real. And I think that\u2019s one of the main beauties of this documentary. This is us talking about our life. We\u2019re not holding back, and I think that Isabel did an amazing job putting that all together and telling our story. And hopefully this will resonate for another 30, 40, years after I\u2019m no longer here. I hope it inspires.",
      "Another main reason is that I wanted to leave something behind. Selena was a beacon and I see her as that as well. People still look up to her and they admire her. I hope that after seeing this documentary, they walk away with that same mindset that their dream is attainable.",
      "SQ: I really don\u2019t know. That\u2019s kind of hard to say. I know that whatever she would have done, she would have been at the forefront of whatever she did. I think she would still be a beacon no matter whatever she did if she was still here and a complete role model. I do 100% believe if she was still here, she would be kicking ass in the design world and a designer.",
      "SQ: Every once in a while when I\u2019m in front of a live band, yeah, I want to play. But for the most part, I\u2019m at ease with that and I\u2019m fine with it because I keep myself so busy on the business side of everything. But I do miss it and I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t.",
      "SQ: I\u2019m going to be very real with you. At the beginning, it was very, extremely difficult to live without her, hands down. I didn\u2019t think I would still be here, to be honest with you, that\u2019s how much grief took over. And then at one point I realized, after a couple of years of being in this mindset of feeling numb, so to speak, I realized that I needed to come out of it.",
      "I didn\u2019t go to therapy because back then, you know how (some) Mexican  (families) are. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in therapy.\u201d It\u2019s more like, \u201cCome and talk to your tia (aunt) type of therapy.\u201d But one thing I did is I prayed to God every day just to get me through that one day. That\u2019s it. Not the week, not the month, one day. And it just happened like that. And at one point, I started to let go of anger that I had in my heart for the person who took her life. Let go of things that I had no control over. Stay away from the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d What if she was still here, what if she wouldn\u2019t have gone? What if? It doesn\u2019t matter because at the end of the day, the what ifs always brought me back around to the same thing: She is still not here.",
      "I went through this transition of healing my heart and my soul. It's still broken and it will forever be broken, and that's life. I'll probably go home, I\u2019ll go back to the hotel, probably have a good cry because I\u2019m going down memory lane today, but it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s a good cry and there\u2019s nothing wrong with crying here and there.",
      "I do miss her tremendously, but I'm in a place where we're celebrating not just Selena, but what we accomplished as a whole and as a family. That's what this documentary is about. I hope that my words resonate because what we can only do is celebrate the ones that are no longer with us anymore and keep their memory present."

    "summary": "At least 10 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack that struck a residential tower block in the city of Ternopil, Ukrainian officials said.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump this week approved a 28-point plan for peace between Russia and Ukraine that top administration officials have quietly developed over the last several weeks in consultation with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and Ukrainian officials, a senior administration official told NBC News.",
      "Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner were involved in formulating the plan, the official said.",
      "\u201cThe plan focuses on giving both sides security guarantees to secure a lasting peace,\u201d the senior official told NBC News. \u201cIt includes things Ukraine wants and needs to have a durable peace.\u201d",
      "The official would not outline details of a plan that the official believes is still up for some degree of negotiation with the key parties involved. Axios first reported the existence of the plan.",
      "Three U.S. officials told NBC News that the framework for the peace deal still needed to be presented to the Ukrainians and that the timing of finalizing a draft of the plan coincided with the visit of an Army delegation to Ukraine.",
      "\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas. And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions,\" Rubio posted on X on Wednesday. \"That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.\"",
      "The American delegation arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday morning with two missions for its meetings with Ukrainian officials: to discuss military strategy and technology and to help revive the peace process, according to two U.S. officials, a European official and a source close to the Ukrainian government.",
      "Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was joined by the Army chief of staff, Gen. Randy George, and other top Army officials, Col. Dave Butler, an Army spokesperson, said in a statement, hours after Ukrainian police said at least 25 people were killed in heavy overnight Russian missile and drone attacks.",
      "A U.S. official described the trip as a White House plan intended to \u201crestart peace negotiations.\u201d",
      "American efforts to revive peace negotiations appear to be gaining momentum, although the Kremlin has shown no sign of changing its terms for ending the war and it played down a media report that the United States was working on a 28-point peace plan.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at a news briefing that there were \u201cno such plans\u201d for Russia to meet Driscoll after his talks in Kyiv, indicating there had been little change since talks in Alaska in August.",
      "A defense official said that Driscoll has been briefed on the 28-point plan but that is not the main focus of his meetings in Kyiv.",
      "Ukraine did not take part in shaping the proposed peace plan, according to a source close to the Ukrainian government and a European official with knowledge of the matter. Ukraine was informed of the broad contours of the plan but was not briefed in detail and was not asked to provide input, the two sources said.",
      "Ukrainian officials view the timing of the proposal, coinciding with a damaging corruption scandal facing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government, as no coincidence, the source close to the Ukrainian government said, and the officials see it as most likely an attempt by the Kremlin to take advantage of a potentially weakened Ukrainian leadership.",
      "A Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has led on legislation to punish Russia for its actions in Ukraine, told NBC News he was not previously aware of the plan.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d said Graham, who spoke to Trump on Tuesday evening. \u201cBut I will say this: I hope there\u2019s no plan out there \u2014 no plan will work unless [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes that we\u2019re serious about continuing to provide higher end military aid to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The U.S. delegation in Kyiv is discussing military matters, including air defense efforts against Russian drone and missile attacks on the country\u2019s energy infrastructure, and mapping the front line to help a possible peace process, said the source close to the Ukrainian government and a European official with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Previous diplomatic efforts led by Witkoff also excluded Ukraine and collapsed, as Kyiv and NATO allies viewed the proposals as lopsided in Moscow\u2019s favor with little realistic prospect of resolving the conflict.",
      "Russia has consistently demanded severe restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, prohibiting the country from joining the NATO alliance and barring the presence of Western troops to secure any peace.",
      "\u201cThe president has been clear that it is time to stop the killing and make a deal to end the war. President Trump believes that there is a chance to end this senseless war if flexibility is shown,\u201d a White House official said.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 A former United Nations investigator who wrote the authoritative report on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi told NBC News on Wednesday that she was \u201cshocked and angry\u201d at President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of intelligence saying Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the killing.",
      "Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the secretary general of the watchdog Amnesty International, said there was \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi\u2019s grisly bone-saw killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018. American intelligence said that the crown prince personally approved the operation to kill or kidnap the Washington Post columnist, something the de facto Saudi leader has denied despite apologizing for the murder by his officials.",
      "As the Saudi leader visited the White House on Tuesday, Trump disavowed the findings by his own intelligence agencies, saying the crown prince \u201cknew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,\u201d even chiding the enquiring reporter for trying to \u201cembarrass our guests by asking a question like that.\u201d",
      "Trump called Khashoggi \u201cextremely controversial\u201d and claimed that \u201ca lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He added, \u201cWhether you like him or didn\u2019t like him, things happen.\u201d",
      "The remarks surprised Callamard, who while serving as the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary killings investigated Khashoggi\u2019s murder and in 2019 wrote arguably the most detailed and authoritative report about what happened.",
      "\u201cI was astonished, shocked and angry,\u201d Callamard said of Trump's comments. \u201cWhat\u2019s controversial is flying 15 operatives from Saudi Arabia to a foreign country to commit a murder.\u201d",
      "There is \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that Crown Prince Mohammed ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, she maintained. \u201cAnd frankly, there is no doubt in the mind of anyone who knows Saudi Arabia.\u201d",
      "Trump's remarks have provoked widespread outrage.",
      "Khashoggi\u2019s widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, told Reuters that she wished Trump could meet \u201cthe real Jamal,\u201d and that nothing can \u201cjustify just a horrible crime.\u201d.",
      "The Washington Post called \u201cTrump\u2019s performance at the White House \u2026 weak, crass and of no strategic benefit to America.\u201d And the National Press Club warned the remarks would have \u201creal-world consequences,\u201d including emboldening authoritarian states that \u201cwish to silence reporters.\"",
      "NBC News has contacted the White House and the Saudi Embassy in London for a response to the criticisms contained in this story.",
      "Some Middle East analysts say that despite the global outrage, Trump\u2019s comments reflect his desire to build on the deep economic ties between Washington and Riyadh.",
      "During the Saudi leader\u2019s visit this week, Trump announced he would sell the crown prince F-35 fighter jets, treating his guest to a flyover of the high-tech planes, as well as a gunfire salute.",
      "Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s largest buyer of American weapons. In May, the U.S. announced it was selling the Gulf state almost $142 billion of \u201cstate-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services,\u201d part of a wider $600 billion investment package.",
      "Despite the lavish welcome, Trump did not appear to make headway on his wish for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, a group of Arab nations that have recognized the state of Israel. The crown prince told the Oval Office he did not want to sign anything \u201cuntil we secure a clear path of two-state solution\u201d for Palestinians.",
      "Trump has \u201calways been pretty clear that the relationship with Saudi Arabia is important to him and that he gets on with Mohammed bin Salman,\u201d said Michael Stephens, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank based in London. \u201cI suspect Trump did not want the trip to be derailed.\u201d",
      "Noting past controversial statements from Trump \u2014 including calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator,\u201d before retracting it \u2014 Stephens said such remarks should be taken with a \u201cpinch of salt.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I view this as is relationship management, making sure that Saudi Arabia and [bin Salman] feel personally supported by Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "The crown prince himself called Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u201cpainful\u201d and a \u201chuge mistake\u201d Tuesday, while offering little encouragement other than a polite smile to Trump\u2019s overtures.",
      "He said his kingdom had taken \u201call the right steps of investigation\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ve improved our system to be sure that nothing\u201d similar happens again.",
      "Indeed, the crown prince has been attempting to transform the kingdom from a conservative, oil-rich theocracy into a major economic power built on business, tourism, entertainment and sports.",
      "There have been some reforms, including removing the requirement for women to wear headscarves in public, allowing them to drive and to attend soccer matches.",
      "Saudi authorities have worked hard to wash away the anger over human rights abuses and the killing of Khashoggi, who was lured into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to obtain a document, before being killed and dismembered by the 15-member Saudi team waiting there. His remains have never been recovered.",
      "A 2021 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence cited \"the direct involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin Salman's protective detail in the operation\" and concluded it was \"highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince's authorization.\"",
      "The kingdom still has an \u201cabysmal human rights record,\u201d according to Human Rights Watch, crushing political dissent and executing at least 300 people this year.",
      "Presenting Crown Prince Mohammed as \"a beacon or an icon of modernity for his country is a joke,\" Callamard said, calling the kingdom's reforms \"very superficial.\"",
      "She noted that Trump was merely \"the latest in a succession of global leaders who have normalized and legitimized Mohammed bin Salman within the international community and the international context.\"",
      "While he was a presidential candidate, Joe Biden called the kingdom a \u201cpariah,\u201d only to receive widespread criticism in 2022 for traveling to Saudi Arabia and fist-bumping the crown prince, an incident derided by Trump on Tuesday.",
      "\"Saudi Arabia is being acknowledged because of its geostrategic interest, because of its oil resources, because of the fact that it is key to any attempt of bringing peace to the Middle East,\" she said. \"I don't see that as a recognition of [Crown Prince Mohammed] as anything other than a killer.\""

      "Consistently rated one of Britain\u2019s most popular royals, Kate appears to have eased into a fuller return to public duties this week.",
      "She made her first in-person speech Monday since she shared her cancer diagnosis 18 months ago.",
      "\u201cThe love we feel in our earliest years fundamentally shapes who we become and how we thrive as adults,\u201d Kate said, addressing business leaders at the Future Workforce Summit in London about the importance of early childhood, a cause she has championed for years.",

      "The princess has made a growing number of public appearances since she announced this year that her cancer was in remission, but the speech appears to bring her back into the royal fold more permanently.",
      "\"Welcome back, Princess,\" beamed the Daily Telegraph front page.",
      "She drew more positive coverage after a further appearance Wednesday evening for one of the most joyful events on the royal calendar, the annual Royal Variety Performance, telling well-wishers it was \u201cso nice to be back\u201d at the event, according to British media.",

      "The focus has been on anything but the family\u2019s normal load of public engagements and ribbon cutting in recent years as the royals have endured a stream of uncertainty and upheaval since Queen Elizabeth II's death in 2022.",
      "The royal family was shaken early last year by the announcement that Charles, then 75, had been diagnosed with cancer after just two years on the throne, for which he is still undergoing treatment.",
      "Relations with the media were then undercut by a damaging saga when Kate, then largely absent from the public eye, admitted having altered a family photo released by the palace. Weeks later, Kate announced her diagnosis and said she was undergoing chemotherapy.",

      "It was the king\u2019s younger brother Andrew who generated what Prescott called the first significant crisis of Charles\u2019 reign, with fresh revelations about his ties to Epstein last month spurring the king to strip his royal titles and eject him from his home in Windsor.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that she\u2019s never put a foot wrong,\u201d Prescott said. A sense of affection and support for William after his mother, Princess Diana, died in a car crash extended to Kate after she married into the royal family and \u201cgave her a good platform from which to build,\u201d he added.",

      "China hinted that it might halt seafood imports from Japan on Wednesday after it warned its citizens to avoid traveling there and postponed the releases in China of at least two Japanese movies.",
      "The two largest economies in Asia have been locked in a war of words that began when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi told lawmakers Nov. 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a military response from Tokyo. It was the first time such a comment had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, a U.S. ally that has a mutual defense pact with Washington.",
      "China, which claims self-ruling Taiwan as a breakaway province to be seized by force if necessary, has repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her \u201cegregious\u201d remarks, saying it will take \u201csevere\u201d countermeasures if she refuses.",

      "On Wednesday, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry suggested that China might reimpose its ban on imports of Japanese seafood because Japan has \u201cso far failed\u201d to provide documents proving the quality and safety of its aquatic products.",
      "China resumed importing seafood from all but 10 Japanese prefectures this month after having suspended imports two years ago over the release of treated radioactive wastewater from Japan\u2019s wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.",
      "Takaichi\u2019s comments about Taiwan have triggered \u201cstrong public outrage in China,\u201d ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u201cUnder the current circumstances, even if Japanese aquatic products were exported to China, they would have no market.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s newest sign of economic retaliation came days after authorities advised Chinese citizens not to travel to Japan, saying Takaichi\u2019s \u201cblatantly provocative\u201d Taiwan remarks posed a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to the safety of Chinese people in the country.",
      "Japan, which says it continues to prefer a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue, has also advised its citizens to take extra safety precautions in China.",

      "If the library system in the Canadian city of Hamilton, Ontario, handed out fines for overdue books, the one for a recently returned tome titled \u201cThe Excellent Woman\u201d would be a whopper.",
      "The Victorian-era guidebook for ambitious Christian women by a British writer named Anne Pratt appears to have been checked out about 135 years ago from the Hamilton Public Library, a spokesperson for the library said.",
      "And the suspected scofflaw, a \"Miss Charlotte Morgan\" of Central School in Hamilton, incriminated herself by writing her name on a back page.",
      "\u201cWe know she was a teacher at the school in the 1890s, and we know she died in 1942,\u201d Robert Moore, a history teacher who found the book in his late father\u2019s house and returned it to the library last week, told NBC News. \u201cThe mystery now is when exactly in the 1890s she checked the book out and how it wound up behind the grate at the school where my father found it 50 years ago.\u201d",
      "As for the book, it appears to be one of the first volumes that appeared on the shelves when the library opened its doors in September 1890, Moore said. \u201cInside it is listed as book No. 54, written by hand in ink,\u201d he said.",
      "Shelley McKay, a spokesperson for the library, said, \u201cThis might be one of the original books from the original Hamilton library.\u201d",
      "McKay said this edition was published in 1852 in Boston, five years after it made its debut in England.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in good shape,\u201d she said. \u201cI should look so good at its age.\u201d",
      "Moore said his father, Tom, was a \u201cstationary engineer\u201d at what was then called the Central Public School. He said his dad was doing some renovations on the heating system when he stumbled across the book and brought it home.",
      "\u201cI remember him showing it to us, and I remember reading it,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt had all these beautiful illustrations and very flowery Victorian language. \u201c",
      "Moore said that it sat on a bookshelf until his father died this year and that he came across it when he was cleaning out the house.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018This has got to go back to the library,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "It was welcomed back with open arms, McKay said.",
      "\u201cHe brought it to our Sherwood branch, and we were more than a little surprised and taken aback by the discovery,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked whether she had had a chance to peruse the book, McKay said she had.",
      "\u201cI would say it\u2019s of its time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really a beautiful book. The illustrations are gorgeous.\u201d",
      "While Pratt wrote the book, her name does not appear on the title page on this edition. Instead, the name of the author of the introduction, a Protestant clergyman named William B. Sprague, is prominently displayed.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s because Sprague was well-known at the time,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe had his sermons published. And there was still a stigma against books by women writers.\u201d",
      "Pratt\u2019s book is essentially a commentary on the Bible\u2019s Book of Proverbs, which discusses \u2014 and offers tips on \u2014 how women should behave.",
      "Moore said the book, for its time, was \u201cvery empowering for women,\u201d although it might not go over well with \u201chard-core feminists\" today.",
      "\u201cAnne Pratt was very critical of vapid women in England who just aimed to marry well and go to parties,\u201d Moore said. \u201cShe was encouraging women to do more with their lives, to be in a partnership with their husbands and not just submit to their husbands.\u201d",
      "McKay said that the recovery of Pratt\u2019s book has generated great excitement in Hamilton and that she has gotten numerous calls from people who want to see it.",
      "\u201cWe hope this will encourage people to look under their beds in their closets and return those old library materials,\u201d McKay said.",
      "But there are no plans to put Pratt's book back out into circulation.",
      "\u201cThis is heading to the archives,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cYou\u2019re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\u201d Trump said Tuesday in response to questions from a journalist about Khashoggi. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about. Whether you like him or didn\u2019t like him, things happen, but [the crown prince] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Trump began his remarks by saying that he was proud of the crown prince in \u201cterms of human rights and everything else.\u201d",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed, 40, became an international pariah after the 2018 murder of Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government. At the time, Trump defended the Saudi government even after the CIA concluded that the crown prince himself ordered the killing.",
      "Trump lashed out at a reporter from ABC News who asked the crown prince about Khashoggi's death and about criticism from the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, many of whom have long pushed for answers on the Saudi government's potential ties to the attackers.",
      "\"ABC, fake news, one of the worst, one of the worst in the business,\" he said.",
      "The crown prince dismissed the criticisms against the Saudi government as part of a campaign to drive a wedge between Washington and Riyadh.",
      "\"I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America,\" he said. \"But you know, we have to focus on reality.\"",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed also defended the kingdom\u2019s probe into Khashoggi's murder, which he said included internal reforms. A Saudi court sentenced five people to death for their involvement in the killing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said, promising that \u201cwe are doing our best that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",

While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press. The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.\"",
      "The crown prince said in 2019 that he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the Khashoggi killing since it happened on his watch but denied having ordered it.",
      "Khashoggi's death has highlighted the risks journalists face around the world, particularly in areas where there is conflict. A report from the Committee to Protect Journalists released in February said that at least 124 journalists and media workers were killed in 2024, mainly Palestinian journalists killed as a result of Israel's military offensive in Gaza.",
      "The crown prince's trip Tuesday will be seen more broadly as a move toward acceptance back into the diplomatic fold.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of figure now. Obviously, the questions about the manner of his rule and internal repression, those things haven\u2019t gone away. But he\u2019s a changed figure; it\u2019s a changed moment. And, I think, important symbolically in that sense,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit organization based in Brussels that works to prevent conflicts.",
      "He added: \u201cHe\u2019s central to what this administration wants to do in the region.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s welcome of the crown prince was an elaborate display of pomp and circumstance. After arriving at the White House, the crown prince was greeted by a military flyover of stealth fighter jets, officers on horseback and a tour of the Rose Garden from Trump. Later, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president praised the reception that he received when he visited the kingdom this year. \u201cI love the country and people,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump and the crown prince joked about investing $1 trillion \u2014 a sum roughly equal to Saudi Arabia's entire wealth fund \u2014 into the United States, up from a $600 billion pledge.",
      "The two leaders are also expected to sign economic and defense agreements, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "Even before the crown prince had set foot in the United States, Trump confirmed at an Oval Office event Monday that he would be willing to sign off on the sale of F-35 stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, a contentious move that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East, where Israel has been the primary recipient of America\u2019s cutting-edge military technology. Trump repeated the pledge Tuesday and promised a deal.",
      "Trump\u2019s announcement of the sale may not actually lead to Saudi Arabia receiving the F-35s anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe devil will kind of be in the details there,\u201d said Andrew Leber, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has done extensive research on Saudi Arabia, noting that a similar deal announced with the United Arab Emirates fell through.",
      "He added, \u201cThat deal ultimately ran aground on a combination of U.S. concerns with maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge and concerns about the extent to which U.S. security technology might leak to China.\u201d",
      "Trump designated Saudi Arabia a \u201cMajor Non-NATO Ally\" on Tuesday, noting that the classification would take the country\u2019s military cooperation with the United States \u201cto even greater heights.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou always had a little cloud over your head, and sometimes that cloud was very big. That cloud is not there anymore, and we want to keep it that way,\u201d Trump said before he announced the designation at a dinner honoring Crown Prince Mohammed.",
      "Major Non-NATO Ally status is a designation that \u201cprovides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security cooperation,\u201d according to the State Department. It does not, however, require U.S. security commitments to such countries.",
      "The possibility of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel is a key part of the talks. \u201cI already brought it up,\" Trump said when asked about the prospect of Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords, the 2020 U.S.-brokered agreement that led a number of regional countries to establish formal diplomatic ties with Israel. \"I don\u2019t want to use the word 'commitment,' but we had a good talk,\" he said.",
      "Analysts have been skeptical about a breakthrough.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no near-term horizon for normalization at the moment,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "\"The risks for Mohammed bin Salman are extremely high if he joins the Abraham Accords,\" agreed Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. He noted that Saudi Arabia had made clear it would need some form of Israeli commitment to a path to a Palestinian state \u2014 something Israel has publicly dismissed.",
      "The crown prince's strategy was generally \"to minimize the risks to his rule,\" Gerges said.",
      "Even if the crown prince does not announce the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel, he has won favor with Trump as one of the regional leaders who helped pull together the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Trump has long touted his deal-making abilities and, according to a senior administration official, a number of deals are expected to be announced Tuesday, including a multibillion-dollar Saudi investment in America\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge via dozens of targeted investments.",
      "Critics have raised questions about Trump\u2019s affinity for mixing personal business and diplomacy. His properties have for years hosted tournaments for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. And The New York Times reported this weekend that the Trump Organization is looking at a huge real estate deal with Saudi Arabia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some massive ethical questions in here,\u201d Leber of the Carnegie Endowment said. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that all of the Gulf states have realized that the way you get to Trump is to find some way to enrich his family members, enrich his friends, promise to enrich them down the line.\u201d",
      "Trump, asked about his family\u2019s business ties to Saudi Arabia, said they \u201cdo business all over,\u201d and that he's no longer involved in the activities.",
      "Governments dealing with Saudi Arabia, human rights groups have long said, should also push the country\u2019s leaders on its dismal human rights record. In August, a report from Human Rights Watch noted an \u201cunprecedented surge\u201d in executions in 2025, with 241 people put to death as of Aug. 5.",
      "Still, the restrictions on women, another regular criticism leveled at the kingdom, have been eased, and the crown prince has tried to open up the society to Western exports, like Ultimate Fighting Championship matches and comedy shows, though the comedians who recently appeared at a comedy festival in Riyadh, including Louis C.K. and Bill Burr, were blasted for performing there.",
      "\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been political reform in the sense of creating space for real politics, but he\u2019s absolutely, fundamentally reoriented Saudi society and changed the role of the religious authorities,\u201d Hanna of the ICG said. \u201cThere\u2019s incredible social change that has happened partly because he\u2019s operating without any real constraints.\""

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan may have passed the U.N. Security Council. But there are still major questions of how it will work.",
    "story": [
      "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, this was \"one of the biggest approvals in the history of the United Nations,\" a \"moment of true historic proportion\" that would \" lead to further peace all over the world.\" But the gravity of the U.N. Security Council's endorsement of the U.S. Gaza plan raised renewed questions Tuesday over how it will actually work.",
      "Most pressingly, it is not clear whether those at the heart of the conflict \u2014 the Palestinians and the Israelis themselves \u2014 actually support its end goals.",
      "Hamas, which still controls around half of the strip, outright rejected the resolution and said it robs Palestinians of their own agency, effectively giving Trump free rein over the Gaza Strip for the next two years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed its passage, but he previously said he rejects its talk of \"Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\"",
      "On a practical level, the proposal says it will require the creation of several as-yet-nonexistent bodies, including the \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d headed by Trump and the International Stabilization Force, or ISF, whose troops could be drawn from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates and as far away as Indonesia.",
      "That having been said, this was a rare moment of geopolitical unity.",
      "Trump's team won the support of Arab states by inserting language hinting at a future Palestinian state, and Russia and China abstained from the vote rather than use their vetoes to torpedo the proposal outright.",
      "It passed 13-0.",
      "Summarizing the mood Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres welcomed the vote as \"an important step\" but cautioned that it was \"essential now to translate the diplomatic momentum into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "It's a sentiment shared by many observers.",
      "Frank Lowenstein, former special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Barack Obama, told NBC News that passing the resolution was \"essential\" for Trump's proposal.",
      "\"There was no way this Trump plan could possibly work without a U.N. Security Council resolution,\" he said. Not only will it impart \"the credibility and the legitimacy and the clear support of the international community,\" but it also \"provides an opportunity to begin creating a new reality, to begin moving forward with the process in a way that will give people hope.\"",
      "He cautioned, however, that the resolution's passage was \"nowhere near sufficient,\" principally because the U.N. has no enforcement mechanism, and that Hamas immediately rejected the ISF.",
      "The resolution claims \"the parties\" to the conflict \"have accepted it.\" But it's not clear that is the case.",
      "The main Palestinian governmental body, the Palestinian Authority, said in a statement Tuesday that it welcomed the resolution and expressed its \"full readiness to cooperate\" with the United States and its backers.",
      "But Hamas, the perpetrators of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, said the agreement did not meet the \"political and humanitarian demands and rights\" of the Palestinian people.",
      "The Palestinian militant-political group, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and would be disarmed under the deal, said in a statement that the mandate the resolution grants to the ISF to use force \u201cstrips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.\u201d",
      "NBC News has contacted the White House for a response to those criticisms.",
      "Netanyahu praised Trump and \"his tireless and devoted team,\" saying he believed the plan \"will lead to peace and prosperity because it insists upon full demilitarization, disarmament and the deradicalization of Gaza.\"",
      "But just a day earlier, he had firmly rejected the resolution\u2019s call for \u201ca pathway towards Palestinian self-determination and eventual statehood,\u201d under pressure from his far-right coalition partners.",
      "Even putting those differences to one side, there are big question marks about how the basics of this plan will work in practice.",
      "\u201cThere is a genuine sense of relief that we are moving forward to diplomacy,\u201d said Nimrod Goren, the president of the Mitvim Institute, a progressive Israeli think tank.",
      "\u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s not really clear where all this is headed,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat is the commitment of the leaders, the motivations of those behind it? And can it actually lead us away from the status quo in which Hamas still controls part of Gaza and Israel controls other parts around it?\u201d",
      "On his Truth Social platform, Trump said members of the Board of Peace would be named in the coming weeks \u2014 having previously said British Prime Minister Tony Blair would be involved \u2014 and to expect \"many more exciting announcements.\"",
      "Goren said: \"There are all kinds of new terminology and mechanisms that do not yet exist. So there are a lot of question marks on the basic premises: What is their mandate? How will they be set up?\"",
      "Indonesia, one of the backers of the U.S. proposal, says it is readying 20,000 troops to deploy to the ISF. But they are unlikely to head into Gaza so long as Hamas opposes the deal, Lowenstein said.",
      "\"Nobody's going to send troops to be a part of the stabilization force that's going to be fighting Hamas,\" he said."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Gaza peace plan was passed by a majority vote at the United Nations on Monday, though world powers were still divided over whether it can convert a fragile ceasefire into the long-term solution that has eluded the Middle East.",
      "Much about the plan remains uncertain, with occasional outbreaks of violence between Israel and Hamas threatening the tenuous diplomacy at every turn and Palestinians inside Gaza suffering hunger and now flooding at the onset of a bitter winter.",
      "The fraught path was made clear even before the delegates took to their desks, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 under pressure from his far-right coalition partners \u2014 denouncing the resolution's outlining of a future Palestinian state. Hamas also warned against the U.S. proposal.",
      "The Security Council adopted the plan with 13 votes in favor, zero votes against and two abstentions, Russia and China.",
      "\"Today\u2019s resolution represents another significant step towards a stable Gaza that will be able to prosper, and an environment that will allow Israel to live in security,\" Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said after the vote.",
      "Designed to usher Gaza from rubble-strewn war zone into a new era, the resolution backs establishing a \u201cBoard of Peace,\u201d headed by the president himself, to temporarily govern the territory. Alongside that, an International Stabilization Force, known as the ISF, would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "The proposal would be \u201cphase two\u201d of Trump\u2019s 20-point plan first announced in September, \u201cphase one\u201d of which brought a prisoner and hostage exchange, as well as a ceasefire that has largely held despite accusations of violations from both sides.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed at least 69,000 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to local health officials. Israel launched it after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist, attack in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 more were kidnapped.",
      "Some Security Council members objected that the U.S. resolution made no reference of Palestinian statehood, according to The Associated Press. The draft now says that after the Palestinian Authority has \u201cfaithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,\u201d the AP reported.",
      "The resolution supporting the U.S. plan is backed by Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other Arab states, as well as Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan. Of those, the only ones on the Security Council are the United States and Pakistan, a nonpermanent member, which therefore does not have a veto.",
      "A joint statement from the United States and its backers said the \u201cprocess offers a pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\u201d and \u201cprovides a viable path towards peace and stability, not only between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but for the entire region.\u201d",
      "The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, lauded Trump for having \u201cassembled the Arab leaders and got them all to sign on the historic agreement.\u201d On Palestinian statehood, he issued a caveat that \u201cthe resolution does not call for the state, but it does say that it lays the groundwork, providing that there are reforms that have been called for for a long time.\u201d",
      "Even so, the open door to Palestinian statehood within the resolution has angered the Israeli far right, whose leading politicians are propping up Netanyahu\u2019s government. Under pressure from them, Netanyahu came out Sunday saying that \u201cour opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory has not changed.\u201d",
      "He said at a meeting: \u201cGaza will be demobilized and Hamas will be disarmed, the easy way or the hard way. I don\u2019t need reinforcements and tweets and lectures from anyone.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Sunday he may hold talks with Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, even as the United States intensified its military pressure with the latest strike on an alleged drug boat and the arrival of its most advanced aircraft carrier.",
      "The suggestion of a possible diplomatic path to defuse the mounting tensions with the South American country came after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States would designate the Cartel de los Soles, a group Washington alleges is run by Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "The designation, set to take effect on Nov. 24, puts the cartel among the likes of Hamas and the Islamic State group. It allows the U.S. government to seize its assets and makes it unlawful to provide \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the group.",
      "Maduro denies having any ties to the drug trade, accusing the United States of \u201cfabricating\u201d a war against him.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Air Force One late Sunday, Trump indicated the United States \u201cmay be having some discussions with Maduro,\u201d adding that \u201cthey would like to talk.\u201d He did not elaborate further on the possibility of talks.",
      "Asked whether the terrorist designation means the United States could then target Maduro\u2019s personal assets, Trump said: \u201cIt allows us to do that, but we haven\u2019t said we\u2019re going to do that.\u201d",
      "He was speaking after U.S. Southern Command confirmed on X that it carried out a strike on an alleged drug boat in the eastern Pacific on Saturday, killing three people.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the strike, Southern Command said in a post on X. The post alleged that the boat was \u201coperated by a Designated Terrorist Organization\u201d and was \u201ctrafficking narcotics in the Eastern Pacific,\u201d adding that the strike took place in international waters.",
      "\u201cIntelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\u201d the post said.",
      "NBC News has not independently confirmed the military\u2019s account. The administration has not provided evidence supporting its allegations about the vessel or the people on board.",
      "Video released by Southern Command appears to show the strike causing a large wave to spike up next to the boat, which is then engulfed in flames.",
      "The United States has now conducted at least 21 strikes on alleged drug boats during the second Trump administration, prompting concerns from some lawmakers.",
      "NBC News reported last week that the Trump administration carried out its 20th such attack, according to a Pentagon official. That strike took place in the Caribbean Sea. Previous attacks took place in both the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, and they have killed more than 75 people, according to officials.",
      "Sunday\u2019s announcement came the day the USS Gerald R. Ford, a major aircraft carrier, arrived in the Caribbean.",
      "Hegseth and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, met with Trump on Friday and briefed him on options for potential military action against Venezuela, according to a senior White House official and a U.S. official familiar with the meeting.",
      "Both officials said Trump has been meeting with his national security team about Venezuela frequently in recent days. Right now, he is satisfied with the strikes on alleged drug vessels, the senior White House official said. But both officials said Trump has expressed a willingness to strike targets on land, as well.",
      "As of Friday evening, Trump had not signed off on strikes on land, but that could change, the officials said. The military options are ready for him, and the United States has assets in the region now, so if he decides to move forward with strikes, they can begin quickly, the officials said.",
      "The strikes have generated controversy in Congress, as Democrats and some Republicans paint the administration's moves as heavy-handed overreach that circumvents lawmakers.",
      "But in October, the Senate rejected a resolution requiring Trump to obtain congressional approval for military strikes in the Caribbean. The Senate this month voted down a similar resolution that would require the president to obtain congressional approval for any military action against Venezuela.",
      "Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky sided with Democrats to require congressional authorization.",
      "Paul said in October in an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the strikes \u201cgo against all of our tradition.\u201d He raised concerns over people being killed without the administration\u2019s providing evidence of crimes, noting the possibility that some of those killed could be innocent."

      "Playtime is canceled for 69 schools in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) on Monday morning thanks to a colorful but potentially risky batch of sand.",
      "Kmart and Target issued product recalls Saturday after samples of a widely used play sand were found to have traces of asbestos, forcing the schools to close, the state government said Sunday.",
      "Inspections are underway and could \u201ctake days,\u201d ACT Education Minister Yvette Berry wrote in a post on Facebook, adding that testing so far had come back \u201cnegative to airborne asbestos\u201d from all schools. People who have been in contact with the sand do not require a clinical assessment, health officials say.",
      "The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said there was a low risk that the asbestos could become airborne or fine enough for inhalation.",
      "The recall follows a similar sand scare last week, sparking fears the playground drama is far from over.",
      "Several schools and preschools in the region were fully or partially closed on Friday after a warning over asbestos risks in children\u2019s sand sold by Officeworks, before the further product recalls were issued.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, these sand products are even more widely used in our schools than the Officeworks products,\u201d said Berry, adding that State Emergency Service volunteers and school staff spent their weekends walking through buildings and \u201cmapping all coloured sand they see.\u201d",
      "The government is \u201crequired to eliminate risk as much as reasonably practicable,\u201d she continued.",
      "Exposure to asbestos, once widely used in building materials, is known to cause lung cancer, mesothelioma and other cancers, and it is linked to more than 40,000 deaths in the U.S. each year.",
      "Australian law prohibits the import or export of asbestos or goods containing asbestos. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2024 announced a comprehensive ban on the mineral."
