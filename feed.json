    "story": [
      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "Witcover was born in Union City, New Jersey, to a Jewish father and Catholic mother. He was raised Catholic and showed an early interest in writing. He wrote in his memoirs that he and a cousin produced a one-page family newspaper on Thanksgiving that they sold for a nickel.",
      "A classmate on his high school basketball team persuaded him to apply to Columbia, which he attended for a semester before joining the Navy. He then re-enrolled in the college after the war ended and obtained a master's degree at Columbia's graduate school of journalism.",
      "Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training. Before he could get started the team decided to move its franchise to Milwaukee and the opportunity died.",
      "By 1962, 11 years after graduation, he had become a senior correspondent and the chief political writer for the Newhouse News Service.",
      "Witcover lived in Washington with his second wife, Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, a biographer of the journalist H.L. Mencken. His first marriage, of nearly four decades, to Marian Laverty, ended in divorce.",
      "\"Jules was the hardest working newsman I ever knew,\" said Walter Mears, who as the chief political writer for The Associated Press traveled extensively with Witcover. \"On the road, you could hear him banging the typewriter before dawn, working on one of his books. He never stopped writing columns and political histories long after most of us had retired.\"",

    "story": [
      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d explores the Ohio-born art-rock band known for their quirky style and misunderstood message",
      "NEW YORK -- You know the band Devo, right? The guys with the funny red plastic hats and jumpsuits? The New Wave musicians behind the silly \u201cWhip It\u201d video? They had that odd, spiky '80s vibe? Well, it turns out you may not know as much as you think.",
      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d is an eye-opening examination of an Ohio-born art-rock band that argues they were perhaps the most misunderstood band on the face of the planet. It debuts on the streaming service Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe were trivialized and pigeonholed,\u201d co-founder Gerald Casale tells The Associated Press. \u201cThis documentary allows us to talk about what we were thinking and what we are motivated by to create what we created.\u201d",
      "Directed by Chris Smith, \u201cDevo\u201d uses archival footage and interviews to trace the band's beginnings, rise and fall, with cameos from fans like David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Neil Young.",
      "Devo introduced themselves to the world in 1977 by making a frenetic version of the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cI Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction,\u201d which earned them a crucial slot on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d On stages, they would wriggle like worms or dress like the guys from \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d",
      "They released their Brian Eno-produced debut, \u201cQ: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!,\u201d in 1978 and reached platinum status with 1980\u2019s \u201cFreedom of Choice,\u201d which featured \u201cWhip It,\u201d a hit just as their label was getting ready to drop them.",
      "But behind the odd neck braces and knee pads were powerful art and literary ideas about where the country was going. They named themselves after the idea that modern society was entering a process of \u201cdevolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were seeing a world that was the antitheses of the idealized, promised future ginned up in the \u201950s and \u201960s.\u201d Casale says in the movie. \u201cWhat we saw was regression.\u201d",
      "The nucleus of the band was formed from tragedy: Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh met at Kent State University, where they lived through the 1970 killing of four unarmed anti-war student protesters by the National Guard.",
      "That tragedy forged in the pair an antiestablishment, anti-capitalist protest, mixing lofty art history with pop culture. They admired Dadaism and Andy Warhol. The factories of Akron inspired their gray overalls and clear plastic face masks \u2014 portraying cogs in a machine like in the art movie \u201cMetropolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had a meta-approach,\u201d Casale tells the AP. \u201cIt was a multimedia, big idea approach. Music was an element, a layer, a dimension, but it was connected to this big worldview.\u201d",
      "Part of Devo's strength was its visual component and their videos were drenched with political commentary. The upbeat \u201cBeautiful World\u201d featured footage of police violence, the KKK and bombings, while \u201cFreedom of Choice\u201d warned against the dangers of conformity.",

      "\u201cNobody wanted to hear us talking about the duality of human nature and the dangers of groupthink and the atrophication of people being able to think logically and think critically,\u201d Casale says. \u201cIt was like, \u2018That\u2019s a bummer. Just tell us about drugs and sex.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rock has always needed bands like Devo, a corrective to the corporate machine. You can see an echo of Devo when M.I.A. raised her middle finger during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2012. The members of Devo cite such bands as Rage Against the Machine and System of a Down as keeping the flame alive.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you can hope is that it will create an awareness and get rid of complacency, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have done that in the past,\u201d Mothersbaugh tells the AP.",

But there\u2019s also, there\u2019s also a lot kids, which is kind of surprising to me, but I think it\u2019s only because they have this thing in their hand that they sometimes use to their advantage.\u201d",
      "Devo are set to hit the road later this year in a co-headlining tour with the B-52's. The Cosmic De-Evolution Tour will kick off Sept. 24 in Toronto and wraps Nov. 2 in Houston.",
      "You may think of Devo as New Wave or early electronica or synth-pop. but they see themselves differently: \u201cWe were true punk, meaning we questioned illegitimate authority and we stayed in our own lane and did our thing, remaining true to our vision,\u201d says Casale. \u201cThat\u2019s punk.\u201d",

      "Johnson was convicted of first-degree murder in September 2024 and the same day, sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for his two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti\u2019s brother, Anthony \u201cBig Jook\u201d Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph\u2019s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Johnson were \u201clooking for somebody\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know who we were going to catch.\u201d",
      "They knew that Young Dolph and some of the artists on his label were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph\u2019s car. They followed him to the cookie shop and opened fire in broad daylight, Smith said. Young Dolph was hit 22 times and died at the scene.",
      "At the earlier trials, prosecutor Paul Hagerman told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down.

The evidence includes calls between Smith and Johnson shortly before the killing and a call between Johnson and Big Jook immediately after.",
      "Smith is also charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder and has pleaded not guilty. A trial date has not been set for him.",

      "Margaret Qualley plays a Bakersfield, California, private investigator in Ethan Coen's \u201cHoney Don't.\u201d",
      "The skies are blue, the sun unrelenting and the body count escalating in the Bakersfield, California, of \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!,\u201d where Margaret Qualley\u2019s private investigator tries to get a handle on the nefarious goings-on in her city with a small-town feel.",
      "It\u2019s the second film in Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke\u2019s so-called \u201clesbian B-movie trilogy,\u201d and while this shaggy caper might not add up to anything significant \u2014 perhaps part of the \u201cB-movie\u201d point \u2014 it is fun and immensely watchable. That\u2019s thanks in large part to Qualley\u2019s turn as the smoothly confident Honey O\u2019Donahue, kind of a Philip Marlowe, or maybe Veronica Mars, in cherry-red lipstick, high heels and silks (inspired choices for the sweltering setting by costume designer Peggy Schnitzer).",
      "Honey is meant to be strikingly \u201cother\u201d in this very downtrodden Bakersfield of eccentrics, dropouts and lost souls, where missing teeth seem to be more prevalent than pedicures. It\u2019s a carnival of very memorable, very Coen-esque misfits, like a grumpy bartender played by Don Swayze and Charlie Day\u2019s clueless police officer Marty Metakawitch. Marty is not the only man in town who has trouble accepting that Honey will never be interested in him. You could play a drinking game with how many times she has to tell hapless men, \u201cI like girls.\u201d",
      "Not only is queer literacy low in this Bakersfield, but many in town seem to have come under the influence of a church leader played by Chris Evans, the Rev. Drew Devlin, whose high-wattage smile and proclivity for flirting have made him a local celebrity. Evans, who seems to be having fun in a weirder role, plays the Rev. Drew as a charismatic creep, an ego-driven and possibly sex-addicted influencer who is also peddling drugs and arranging hits around town. He too has a boss, or bosses, known only as \u201cthe French,\u201d which is amusingly underexplained. And he\u2019s often completely, or nearly, naked and involved in some cringey, experimental acts with his naive followers.",
      "Not unlike the new \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d this saga begins with a suspicious vehicular death. The deceased was an almost-client of Honey\u2019s, which sets her off poking around and looking for answers. Most of her cases are of the cheating spouse type, and this is just more interesting. Meanwhile, others start dropping dead too. Some of these deaths feel spiritually, comedically similar to the Mark Pellegrino sequence in \u201cMullholland Drive\u201d (not the only Lynchian nod). And all signs are pointing back to the church, though Honey gets a bit distracted with a new fling in Aubrey Plaza\u2019s lustful cop MG Falcone and some family drama with her wayward niece Corinne (Talia Ryder).",
      "\u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d might play more like a pilot episode of a television series than a contained film, but it is a step up from Coen and Cooke's previous effort, \u201cDrive Away Dolls,\u201d which felt constructed of comedic parts whose shelf life expired 20 years ago. This script, written by Coen and Cooke, is probably just as vintage, technically speaking, but it feels more timeless. With a stable of memorable side characters, including Josh Pafchek as the reverend's assistant and Jacnier as a skittish new drug dealer named Hector, \u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d is gory, unapologetically sexual, quippy and dark. It also clocks in at under 90 minutes \u2014 they knew just when to get out.",

      "His death on Sunday was disclosed in a death notice published online, prompting a wave of tributes from and an array of fans and those close to him within the industry, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA.",

As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker, charming and vulnerable \u2014 more human \u2014 element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since.",

      "He got his break with \u201cBilly Budd\u201d and Stamp embarked on a career that would see him in the early 1960s be part of the \u201cangry young men\u201d movement that was introducing an element of social realism into British moviemaking.",

      "Zach Cregger's horror film earned $25 million in 3,450 North American theaters, a 43% drop from its first weekend. The highly anticipated film benefited from strong audience reviews and social media trends to attract large crowds.",
      "\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d which lost the battle for first place to \u201cWeapons\u201d during its double premiere, maintained its second spot, bringing in $14.5 million domestically.

      "Billy Joel's beloved motorcycle shop on Long Island, New York, is closing down after nearly 15 years of offering fans a free peek at his personal collection of dozens of bikes.",
      "The music icon will be shuttering 20th Century Cycles in Oyster Bay in late September and auctioning off his collection later this year because of a brain disorder he has been diagnosed with, according to a spokesperson, Claire Mercuri.",
      "In May, Joel announced that he was canceling upcoming concerts after learning he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, a fluid buildup in his brain that can affect thinking, concentrating, memory, movement and more, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The 76-year-old singer, composer and pianist was having trouble with his balance but otherwise felt good, he said in an interview last month on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast.",
      "Joel, who grew up in nearby Hicksville, opened 20th Century Cycles in late 2010 as a place to maintain and repair his motorcycles, restore and customize ones he bought and showcase his collection for the public at no charge.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically promoting an aesthetic here,\" he said in a 2013 YouTube video filmed at the shop. \"I like older style. I like the automotive style from the \u201830s to the \u201960s. I wanted to collect a whole bunch of those kinds of bikes, put \u2019em in one place and let people see what that era of bike looked like. Because it\u2019s starting to be a lost aesthetic.\u201d",
      "He said he also wanted to bring foot traffic and business to downtown Oyster Bay \u2014 a ritzy waterfront community about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of midtown Manhattan \u2014 where part of the street that includes 20th Century Cycles was renamed Billy Joel Way in 2023.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been living in this community for a long time,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cI actually grew up not far from here. And I\u2019d like to get a little interest going into the town and the village.\u201d",

      "The shop became a popular stop for motorcycle enthusiasts and tourists. It was home to Joel's collection of more than 75 bikes, dating back all the way to the 1940s and including Harley-Davidsons, Triumphs, Ducatis, Moto Guzzis, Indians and BMWs. One of the most valuable, he said, was a 1952 Vincent Rapide, which can sell for tens of thousands of dollars and sometimes more, according to auction sites.",
      "\u201cI think everybody in Oyster Bay would agree that it\u2019s a big loss,\" said Ted Bahr, who owns a vintage rock poster gallery next to 20th Century Cycles. \u201cBilly\u2019s place is visited on weekends by dozens and dozens of people, typically on motorcycles but also people in cars,. People come up and look at the window all the time. I mean it\u2019s a real destination. Billy Joel is a real superstar, and he is a hometown boy, so it\u2019s really unfortunate.\"",
      "The motorcycles that were in the shop have already been moved out. But it has been open on recent weekends selling new, used and vintage motorcycle parts that were still in stock there.",
      "Joel's enthusiasm for motorcycles dates back decades. In 1982, he was riding a motorcycle on Long Island when he was struck by a car that ran a red light, injuring his left thumb and dislocating his right wrist. He spent about a month in the hospital. He has also ridden motorcycles in various benefits for 9/11 first responders, breast cancer and other causes over the years.",
      "A date for the auction of his collection has not been set.",

      "Instead of Walther joining the guild of master singers and preparing to marry Eva after he wins the song contest, in Bayeuth's new version she grabs the medal out of the young knight's hands, returns it to her father, then leads her future husband offstage for a future forsaking the traditions of their family and city.",
      "\u201cNo thank you. Let's go!\u201d explained soprano Christian Nilsson, who is singing Eva in her role debut. \u201cShe is a strong girl.\u201d",

      "When \u201cMeistersinger\u201d premiered in 1868, Wagner presented a happy ending in which Walther and Eva joined together and he is admitted to guild. Davids' ending is less jarring than Kasper Holten\u2019s 2017 Covent Garden staging, set in a men's club where Eva is horrified Walther would want to join the misogynistic Meistersingers and runs away in tears.",

      "This time Georg Zeppenfeld was a grandfatherly Sachs in an argyle button through sweater vest. Beckmesser, played fussily but without histrionics by Michael Nagy, had a shimmering silver sweater below a cream Trachten jacket, mirror sunglasses and lute transformed to resemble a heart-shaped electric guitar outlined by pink light that gave him an Elvis Presley look.

Fans of \"Suits\u201d, \u201cWhite Collar\u201d and \u201cMonk\u201d were left with only memories of those shows' case-of-the-week storytelling.

In this \u201cRainmaker,\u201d British actor Milo Callaghan plays Rudy Baylor.

His boss is Jocelyn \u201cBruiser\u201d Stone (Lana Parrilla, in a gender swap from the film where Mickey Rourke had the role). She\u2019s smart, confident and not afraid to use her sex appeal to get what she wants. Rudy\u2019s first big case pits him against the big, fancy law firm that let him go \u2014 and his girlfriend who still works there.",
      "Callaghan told The Associated Press about learning legalese while doing a Memphis accent and familiarizing himself with the source material. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I watched it when I got cast. Matt Damon is somebody that every young actor would look up to. I wanted to be aware of the work that he did. I mean, it was a Coppola movie as well, so I was excited to see it. And then I gave it maybe like 20 minutes' thought and focused on the script because it is different and I think we have 10 hours of television to explore this character. We go on a windier road than the movie.",
      "CALLAGHAN: Yes. It\u2019s a slow-paced thriller, really, but fantastic. And there\u2019s this chunk, it must be about 100 pages, of him just preparing for this case for months and months and months. So I never wanted it to feel like it was off-the-hand genius. It felt like this is a situation that has to be honored to a certain extent. Like, you can be a fantastic lawyer, but you don\u2019t get there without grinding and grafting. We had great scenes where we were working late into the night.",

      "Tristan Rogers, known for his role as Robert Scorpio on \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d has died",
      "Tristan Rogers, who played legacy character Robert Scorpio on ABC's \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d died Friday, less than one month after he made a special appearance on the soap opera. He was 79.",
      "\u201cThe entire \u2018General Hospital\u2019 family is heartbroken to hear of Tristan Rogers' passing,\u201d said Frank Valentini, the show's executive producer, in a statement. \u201cTristan has captivated our fans for 45 years and Port Charles will not be the same without him (or Robert Scorpio).\u201d",
      "Born in Melbourne, Australia, Rogers' first foray into performing was in his early twenties and playing drums in a rock band with a group of friends. They weren't successful so Rogers turned to commercial work and modeling to earn some money. When the band dissolved, Rogers decided to give acting a try. After various roles in Australia, he also worked as a DJ and eventually moved to Los Angeles to try to break into Hollywood. He said casting directors were initially turned off by his accent but he eventually landed a two-day role on \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d in 1980.",
      "\u201cI had no idea at the point how big the show was,\u201d Rogers told fellow \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d actor Maurice Benard on the YouTube show, \u201cState of Mind with Maurice Benard\u201d in 2022.",
      "\u201cI had no name. I was brought in expressly to beat up the hero, Luke, (played by Anthony Geary), and then disappear,\u201d Rogers said. His first day was half-over when then-executive producer Gloria Monty asked if he would like to stay on. They had no character written for him so for three weeks Monty asked him to just appear in scenes \u201clooking furtive, looking suspicious\u201d until they came up with a storyline. It was decided he would play a spy known as \u201cCK8\u201d and eventually he was given the name Robert Scorpio. The character would remain a fixture in Port Charles for the rest of Rogers' life, even when he wasn't a current cast member.",
      "Scorpio's on again/off again romance with Emma Samms' character, Holly Sutton, remained a favorite among fans. Scorpio also had a romance, and many storylines with another spy, Anna Devane, played by Finola Hughes. Scorpio and Devane shared a daughter, Robin, played by Kimberly McCullough. Samms returned to the show for a stint last fall where it was revealed that Scorpio was the father of her adult daughter, Sasha Gilmore (played by Sofia Mattson.)",

      "Filmmaker Kate Beecroft points her lens toward the real cowgirls of the Badlands in the lyrical new film \u201cEast of Wall.\u201d",
      "The film blends fact and fiction to tell a story about the working women of South Dakota, skilled riders and trainers with ranching and rodeo in their blood who also can't seem to catch a break. There are a few Hollywood actors in the mix, including Jennifer Ehle as a hard living grandmother with a lifetime of regrets as well as some nuggets of wisdom and Scoot McNairy as an out-of-towner who wants to acquire the land, but most of the cast are non-actors playing themselves. The film won an audience award earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "At the heart of \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d now playing in select theaters, is Tabatha Zimiga, a South Dakota native whose ability to tame wild horses is the stuff of legend in the area. In the film, the horses she rescues and rehabilitates are sold at auctions and often accepted for far less than what they\u2019re worth. She needs the money. There are bills to pay on the ranch and many mouths to feed (not just her own kids, but others from around the town who come to her for safety and shelter when their own caretakers stop providing).",
      "Tabatha is also living with new and old traumas, from the generational agony of abuse to the more recent death of her husband, the shocking circumstances of which are withheld for some time. But the effects of the loss are still felt, especially for their daughter Porshia (played by her real-life daughter Porshia Zimiga), whose grief is threatening to turn into hate of her mother. Teenage Porshia provides the poetic voiceovers, in which she talks about riding, her mother and, most effectively, the land. It's reminiscent of Linda Manz\u2019s narration in \u201cDays of Heaven.\u201d",
      "\u201cEast of Wall\u201d is best when it\u2019s capturing the landscapes and the girls in action, riding and filming energetic TikToks of their friends racing cars on horseback. Some have suggested that \u201cEast of Wall\u201d might have been stronger as a documentary. These women are vibrant and authentic and don't look like anyone we see in the movies these days, with real bodies and imperfect skin, heads half-shaved, tattoos everywhere and the ability to really, really ride \u2014 no stunt team required. And they have stories to tell, many of them unhappy, as we see in one of the most moving non-action scenes involving a group of mothers speaking candidly about their lives and their regrets.",
      "The real-life drama of financial instability is compelling and likely rooted in truth; however, the introduction of McNairy\u2019s suspect Texan feels like a narrative contrivance and drama for drama\u2019s sake. He offers to buy the ranch and let them live and work as usual, just for him now instead of themselves. These are the kind of scenes that remind you that the filmmakers, despite all their best intentions and care, are, in essence, also interlopers in this world.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\u201d",
      "The country has \u201cbeen fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\u201d when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year\u2019s first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles (72,520 square kilometers) burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.",
      "McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people\u2019s back doors in Canada\u2019s lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.",
      "\u201cPeople can make up their own mind as to why that is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut something clearly has changed.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax \u2014 a belief echoed by many in the GOP \u2014 and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.",
      "He\u2019s proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare \u2014 the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, canceled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels.",
      "The Associated Press reached out to more than half a dozen Republicans who criticized Canada but none returned phone calls or emails.",

      "Here\u2019s what to know about how successful those efforts have been.",
      "The world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic each year, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that could increase by about 70% by 2040 without meaningful change. A great deal of that ends up in landfills or, worse, the environment.",
      "Pollution isn't the only problem. Plastics, made almost entirely from fossil fuels, are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Plastics generated 3.4% \u2014 or 1.8 billion tons \u2014 of planet-warming emissions across the globe in 2019, the United Nations says.",
      "Not very.",
      "It's notoriously difficult to recycle plastics; only 6% of what's made gets recycled, according to the OECD. That's largely because different kinds of plastic cannot be recycled together. They have different chemical compositions, making it costly and time-consuming, and requiring a lot of manual sorting.",
      "\u201cThere are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable,\" said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution.",
      "Experts say plastic is different from materials like paper, cardboard, metal and glass, which all get reused at much higher rates. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates glass recycling at about 31%, and things like steel cans at about 71%. As much as 64% of paper and 74% of cardboard get recycled, according to the American Forest & Paper Association.",
      "But \u201cIf you just think of your own home or apartment, you might have a bright orange hard plastic detergent container on top of your washing machine, and then you might have a plastic bag,\u201d Enck said. \u201cThose two things cannot get recycled together.\"",
      "The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable. Ross Eisenberg, president of America\u2019s Plastic Makers, noted the need for an \u201call-of-the-above approach.\u201d",
      "He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. This also means making recycling more accessible and helping consumers know what can and can\u2019t go in the recycling bin.",
      "But there are a lot of limitations to this.",
      "Depending on consumers for accurate pre-sorting is a lot to ask. And cities may hesitate to make costly infrastructure improvements to their recycling programs if there is little financial incentive or market for the recycled material.",
      "\"Local recycling facilities, or markets for the recycled material, don\u2019t always exist. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents,\" said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute.",

      "Because of this, Kaufman says, \u201cThe aim should be to significantly reduce plastic production, use, and waste, not recycle more.\u201d",
      "\u201cReuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,\u201d Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.",
      "Experts say reuse is extremely important, but reusable products shouldn\u2019t necessarily be used for consumables because of the risk of microplastics.",
      "Redesigning plastic often means making it easier to recycle. That can be using one material in packaging instead of several, or printing labels directly onto a container rather than using a separate one that is glued on, but that is more complex.",
      "Alternatives to plastics could also be made out of sustainable, less harmful and even regenerative materials, such as seaweed, Kaufman said. There has been progress on this front, but most solutions have not scaled up yet.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea and the United States began their annual large-scale joint military exercise on Monday to better cope with threats by nuclear-armed North Korea, which has warned the drills would deepen regional tensions and vowed to respond to \u201cany provocation\u201d against its territory.",
      "The 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, the second of two large-scale exercises held annually in South Korea, after another set in March, will involve 21,000 soldiers, including 18,000 South Koreans, in computer-simulated command post operations and field training.",
      "The drills, which the allies describe as defensive, could trigger a response from North Korea, which has long portrayed the allies\u2019 exercises as invasion rehearsals and has often used them as a pretext for military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.",
      "In a statement last week, North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol said the drills show the allies\u2019 stance of \u201cmilitary confrontation\u201d with the North and declared that its forces would be ready to counteract \u201cany provocation going beyond the boundary line.\u201d",
      "Ulchi Freedom Shield comes at a pivotal moment for South Korea\u2019s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who is preparing for an Aug. 25 summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington. Trump has raised concerns in Seoul that he may shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the American troop presence in South Korea and possibly reducing it as Washington shifts its focus more toward China.",
      "Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high as North Korea has brushed aside Lee\u2019s calls to resume diplomacy with its war-divided rival, with relations having soured in recent years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accelerated his weapons program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhat's needed now is the courage to steadily take steps toward easing tensions, grounded in a firmly maintained state of ironclad security readiness,\u201d Lee said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday. South Korea also on Monday began a four-day civil defense drill involving thousands of public workers, often scheduled alongside the allies\u2019 summertime military exercises.",
      "Seoul\u2019s previous conservative government responded to North Korean threats by expanding military exercises with the United States and seeking stronger U.S. assurances for nuclear deterrence, drawing an angry reaction from Kim, who last year renounced long-term reconciliation goals and rewrote the North\u2019s constitution to label the South a permanent enemy.",
      "In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South\u2019s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks.",

      "But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea\u2019s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume frontline military activities and propaganda campaigns. The step came after North Korea had already declared it would no longer abide by the agreement.",
      "When asked whether the Lee government\u2019s steps to restore the agreement would affect the allies\u2019 drills, the South\u2019s Defense Ministry said Monday that there are no immediate plans to suspend live-fire training near the Koreas\u2019 disputed western maritime border.",
      "While the allies have postponed half of Ulchi Freedom Shield\u2019s originally planned 44 field training programs to September, U.S. military officials denied South Korean media speculation that the scaled-back drills were meant to make room for diplomacy with the North, citing heat concerns and flood damage to some training fields.",
      "Dating back to his first term, Trump has regularly called for South Korea to pay more for the 28,500 American troops stationed on its soil. Public comments by senior Trump administration officials, including Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, have suggested a push to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and role of U.S. forces in South Korea.",
      "Under this approach, South Korea would take a greater role in countering North Korean threats while U.S. forces focus more on China, possibly leaving Seoul to face reduced benefits but increased costs and risks, experts say.",

Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, stressed the need to \u201cmodernize\u201d the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d",

      "Quiroga congratulated Paz on his lead.",
      "\u201cWhat happened is unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cBolivia told the world that we want to live in a free nation.\u201d",

      "The official MAS candidate, Eduardo del Castillo, finished sixth with 3.2% of the vote. A candidate considered to be the party\u2019s best hope, 36-year-old Senate president Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, captured 8% of the vote.",
      "During his almost 14 years in power, Morales expanded the rights of the country\u2019s Indigenous majority, defended coca growers against U.S.-backed eradication programs and poured natural gas profits into social programs.",

      "But the kidnappers demanded more. She sold all her belongings; they still wanted more. Not knowing what else to do, she went to the police, armed with the local bank account number that the kidnappers had been using.",
      "Meanwhile, she was on Facebook, trying to get news of her daughter. Eventually, a post from a survivor confirmed that Tadesse\u2019s daughter had been killed. To date, no arrests have been made.",
      "Although Ethiopia has been relatively stable since the war in the country\u2019s Tigray region ended in 2022, youth unemployment is high and there are still pockets of unrest.",
      "\u201cMany young people no longer see a future for themselves within a nation that does not prioritize their needs,\u201d explained Yared Hailemariam, an Ethiopian human rights advocate based in Addis Ababa. \u201cThe cause of this migration is lack of economic opportunities and growing conflicts. Young people are faced with a choice of either taking up arms to fight in endless conflicts, or providing for their families.\u201d",
      "The war in Tigray was the reason why Nigus Yosef never finished school. When the conflict started in 2020, he was in 7th Grade, and he dropped out to join the Tigray armed forces. When the ceasefire was signed in 2022, he came back home, but couldn\u2019t find a job. After three years, he was desperate.",
      "Residents in the region say that traffickers seize on that desperation, and that their networks extend even into remote areas and rural villages.",
      "Eden Shumiye was just 13 when she left Adi Qeyih with Yosef and his friends. Her parents say that she was preyed on by people smugglers during the town\u2019s public market day, and that they convinced her to leave with the group. Her parents heard nothing from her until one of the other migrants called them when they reached Wuha Limat, near the Ethiopia-Djibouti border. The news left them sick with worry.",
      "After the boat capsized, a relative of one of the survivors managed to send a voice message to them from Saudi Arabia via the messaging app Imo, confirming that Eden\u2019s dead body had been recovered. Of the six young people who left Adi Qeyih, only two survived.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un condemned South Korean-U.S. military drills and vowed a rapid expansion of his nuclear forces to counter rivals, state media said Tuesday, as he inspected his most advanced warship being fitted with nuclear-capable systems.",
      "Kim\u2019s visit to the western port of Nampo on Monday came as the South Korean and U.S. militaries kicked off their annual large-scale summertime exercise to bolster readiness against growing North Korean threats. The 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, which the allies describe as defensive, will mobilize 21,000 troops, including 18,000 South Koreans, for computer-simulated command post operations and field training.",
      "North Korea has long denounced the allies\u2019 joint drills as invasion rehearsals and Kim has often used them to justify his own military displays and testing activities aimed at expanding his nuclear weapons program.",

He claimed that the exercises have grown more provocative than before by incorporating a \u201cnuclear element,\u201d requiring the North to respond with \u201cproactive and overwhelming\u201d countermeasures.",
      "\u201cThe security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day and the prevailing situation requires us to make a radical and swift change in the existing military theory and practice and rapid expansion of nuclearization,\u201d KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying, using the initials of North Korea\u2019s formal name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "The government of South Korea\u2019s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who has expressed a willingness to repair ties and resume dialogue with the North, did not immediately respond to Kim\u2019s comments.

      "South Korean and U.S. military officials say Ulchi Freedom Shield will focus on countering North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear and missile threat and will include training to deter North Korean nuclear use and respond to its missile attacks. The exercise will also incorporate lessons from recent conflicts, including Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the clash between Israel and Iran, and address threats from drones, GPS jamming and cyberattacks.",

State media said the destroyer, which is being prepared to enter active duty next year, is designed to handle various weapons systems, including antiair and anti-naval weapons, as well as nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles.",
      "The North unveiled a second destroyer of the same class in May, but the vessel was damaged during a botched launching ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin, prompting an angry reaction from Kim, who called the failure \u201ccriminal.\u201d The North has said the new destroyer, named Kang Kon, was relaunched in June after repair, but some outside experts have questioned whether the ship is fully operational.",
      "During Monday\u2019s visit to Nampo, Kim also reviewed North Korean efforts to complete a third destroyer by October, KCNA said. While inspecting Choe Hyon, Kim expressed satisfaction with the progress of the warship\u2019s weapons tests and its integrated operations system, saying the navy\u2019s modernization and move toward nuclear-capable capabilities are proceeding as planned. He instructed officials to carry out performance tests in October, KCNA said.",
      "Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened in recent years as Kim accelerated his military nuclear program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. His government has repeatedly dismissed calls by Washington and Seoul to revive negotiations aimed at winding down his nuclear and missile programs, which derailed in 2019 following a collapsed summit with U.S. President Donald Trump during his first term.",
      "In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South\u2019s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks.",
      "The 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between the Koreas, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes. But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea\u2019s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume front line military activities and propaganda campaigns. The step came after North Korea had already declared it would no longer abide by the agreement.",

Its neo-Gothic exterior is considered the town's most distinctive building and tourists regularly traveled there before it was closed a year ago to prepare for the relocation.

      "ROME -- Italy\u2019s Ventina glacier, one of the biggest in northern Lombardy, has melted so much due to climate change that geologists can no longer measure it the way they have for the past 130 years.",
      "After this year\u2019s hot summer, geologists discovered that the simple stakes used as benchmarks to measure the glacier\u2019s retraction each year are now buried under rockslides and debris that have made the terrain too unsteady for future in-person visits.",
      "The Lombardy Glaciological Service said Monday that it will now use drone imagery and remote sensing to keep track of the ongoing shrinkage.",
      "Geologists say that the Ventina glacier has already lost 1.7 kilometers (1 mile) in length since the first measuring benchmarks were positioned at the front of the glacier in 1895.",
      "The melting has accelerated in recent years, with the glacier losing 431 meters (471 yards) in the last 10 years, nearly half of that since 2021, the service said. It's another example of how accelerating global warming is melting and shrinking Europe\u2019s glaciers, causing a host of environmental and other impacts.",
      "\u201cWhile we could still hope until the 1980s that there would be normal cycles (of retraction) or at least a contained retraction, in the last 40 years something truly striking has occurred,\u201d said Andrea Toffaletti, a member of the Lombardy Glaciological Service.",

      "Italy\u2019s mountain glaciers, which are found throughout the Alps and Dolomites in the north and along the central Apennines, have been receding for years, thanks to inadequate snowfall in the winter and record-setting hot summers. Glaciers always melt some in summer, with the runoff fueling mountain streams and rivers.",
      "But the hot summers are \u201cno longer able to guarantee the survival of the winter snowpack,\u201d that keeps the glacier intact, Toffaletti said.",
      "\u201cIn order to regenerate and remain in balance, a certain amount of residual snow from the winter must remain on the glacier's surface at the end of the summer. And this is happening less and less frequently,\u201d said Toffaletti.",
      "According to the Lombardy service, the Alps represent a climate hotspot, recording double the global average of temperature increases since pre-industrial times, resulting in the loss of over 64% of the volume of Alpine glaciers.",
      "In February, the journal Nature reported on a study showing the world\u2019s glaciers lost ice at the rate of about 255 billion tons (231 billion metric tons) annually from 2000 to 2011, but that quickened to about 346 billion tons (314 billion metric tons) annually over about the next decade.",

      "The top U.N. human rights body has accused both the Sudanese armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces of detaining tens of thousands of people without charge since Sudan\u2019s civil war began in 2023",
      "RENK, South Sudan -- As a young man in the mid-1980s, Daud Mahmoud Abdullah left his home in Aweil in South Sudan and headed north. It was a time of war. South Sudan was still part of Sudan and was fighting for independence, in a conflict that would claim about 2 million lives.",
      "He never went back. But now at 60 and after six months in a Sudanese prison, he is closer to home than he\u2019s been in 40 years. This July, he finally crossed the border back into his native South Sudan, taking a deep breath and reminding himself, \u201cI am alive.\u201d",
      "After everything that has happened to him, it feels like a miracle.",
      "Sudan \u2014 once his place of refuge \u2014 has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since April 2023 that has killed 40,000 people and displaced nearly 13 million more, according to U.N. agencies.",
      "Abdullah lived in Wad Madani, the capital of Al Jazirah state, about 135 kilometers (85 miles) south of Khartoum. There had been incursions into the area by the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary force once known as the Janjaweed who were notorious for mass killings, rapes and other atrocities in Darfur two decades ago. More recently, the RSF have again been accused of by the International Criminal Court of committing war crimes, including the attacks on famine-hit Zamzam and other camps in North Darfur.",
      "In January, the Sudanese armed forces began recapturing parts of Al Jazirah state from the RSF and making sweeping arrests. Abdullah got caught up in the incursions on his way home from the market: He was picked up by SAF soldiers and accused of cooperating with the RSF.",
      "Abdullah says that he was \u201cbeaten, tortured and burned with cigarettes\u201d to make him confess. Although he never made a confession, he was thrown in prison.",
      "In a report released in March, the top U.N. human rights body detailed how both the SAF and the RSF have detained tens of thousands of people \u201cwithout charge, with limited or no contact with their families, in squalid and overcrowded facilities\u201d in \u201ca widespread pattern of arbitrary detention, torture, and ill-treatment.\u201d",
      "Abdullah can attest to this. He remembers inmates dying from starvation, beatings or illnesses like cholera daily. One morning, he discovered 28 of his fellow inmates had died in the night. For the next three days the bodies lay inside his cell, and the soldiers refused to remove them. \u201cEven when you shouted to them, they would tell you, \u2018If you want to die also, you can die with them,\" Abdullah said.",
      "The Associated Press spoke to eight men in total, some of whom were detained in other prisons in Al Jazirah state and Khartoum. All recounted nightmarish conditions during their incarceration. They described being crammed into cells alongside hundreds of other prisoners. Cells were so crowded that they were forced to sleep with their knees tucked under their chin. Beatings occurred regularly; one said he lost the use of his right eye as a result.",
      "Michael Deng Dut, 29, said he had been \u201ctortured with electricity more than 18 times.\u201d Simon Tong, 39, said that he was tortured with a knife during an interrogation, and rolled up his sleeve to expose the scars on his arm.",
      "Many of the men said they were given only a handful of food and a small cup of water once a day. \u201cThis is the reason many of us passed away, because of the lack of food and water,\" Tong said.",
      "In July, 99 South Sudanese prisoners were separated from the other inmates. As the men awaited their fate, one died, reducing their number to 98. On July 28, they were bundled into a bus and driven away, not knowing where they were going.",

      "The border town of Renk has become a hub for South Sudanese nationals trying to get home. When the Sudanese civil war broke out in 2023, UN agencies and the South Sudanese government established an onward transportation program which has moved more than 250,000 people, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Office of Migration.",
      "On June 1, the program was suspended due to global cuts to humanitarian funding. The number of people living in and around a transit center in Renk has since swelled to 12,000, roughly six times its intended capacity. Thousands are living in makeshift shelters made of sticks and cloth.",
      "But for Abdullah, arriving in Renk was a moment of overwhelming joy after months of torture and uncertainty. He was overcome to see his wife, daughter, and younger brother waiting for him. His wife had decided to take his family south after his younger brother had been arrested and released by SAF for the third time.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw Abdullah, I thanked God,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did not expect to see him alive again.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- A federal appeals court has upheld a law strengthening the rights of pregnant workers, vacating a judge's earlier order that had stripped those protections from Texas state employees.",
      "The ruling was a victory for advocates of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a law that passed with bipartisan support in 2022 but quickly became embroiled in controversy over whether it covers workers seeking abortions and fertility treatments.",
      "A federal judge last year blocked enforcement of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act for Texas state employees, ruling that its passage was unconstitutional because a majority of House members were not physically present to approve the law as part of spending package in December 2022.",

      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act strengthens the rights of women to receive workplace accommodation for needs related to pregnancy and childbirth, such as time off for medical appointments and exemptions from heavy lifting. Its passage came after a decades long campaign by women's advocacy groups highlighting the struggles of pregnant workers, especially those in low-wage roles, who were routinely forced off the job after requesting accommodations.",
      "The Texas case differed from other lawsuits that have narrowly focused on federal regulations stating that abortion, fertility treatments and birth control are medical issues requiring protection under the new law. The lawsuit, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, instead took aim at the entirety of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, drawing opposition from Republican lawmakers including former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who defended the pandemic-era proxy voting rule.",

President Donald Trump in January fired two of the EEOC\u2019s democratic commissioners, paving the way for him to quickly establish a Republican majority at the agency.

      "WASHINGTON -- A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.",
      "In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet\u2019s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.",
      "Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers\u2019 Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.",
      "\u201cI think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they\u2019re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that\u2019s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that\u2019s been wasted,\" he said.",
      "Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.",
      "A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,\u201d Keoleian said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.\u201d",
      "Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump's criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.",
      "Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said \u201cit didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.\" She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.",
      "Ernst has called the EV initiative a \u201cboondoggle\u201d and \"a textbook example of waste,\u201d citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.",
      "\u201cYou always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that\u2019s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,\" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.",
      "\u201cFor now,\u201d she added, \"gas-powered vehicles \u2014 use some ethanol in them \u2014 I think is wonderful.\u201d",
      "Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.",
      "Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project \"has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.\u201d",
      "The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was \u201cvery modest\" and not unexpected.",
      "\u201cThe production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,\u201d spokesperson Kim Frum said.",
      "The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.",
      "The \u201cDeliver for America\u201d plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.",

      "\u201cDue to Roblox\u2019s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana,\u201d Murrill said in a news release. \u201cRoblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety.\"",
      "The company has faced lawsuits and backlash for not doing enough to protect kids on its gaming services. Last month, a lawsuit was filed in Iowa after a 13-year-old girl was allegedly introduced to an adult predator on the platform, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped.",
      "In Louisiana, Livingston Parish Sheriff Jason Ard said his office has had multiple cases involving Roblox. In one, police allege a man used voice-altering technology to pose as a girl on the platform. Ard said there have yet to be any arrests made related to the gaming site.",
      "Ultimately, Murrill said she believes Roblox should be shut down.",
      "An email seeking comment was sent to the company Thursday.",
      "The free online gaming platform has more than 111 million monthly users. Its website describes Roblox as \"the ultimate virtual universe that lets you create, share experiences with friends, and be anything you can imagine.\u201d",

      "Roblox doesn\u2019t allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information, such as phone numbers. However, as with other gaming platforms and social media sites with similar policies, people find ways around such safeguards.",
      "Roblox, which according to its website has \u201ca zero-tolerance policy for the exploitation of minors,\u201d doesn\u2019t allow children under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission. Because the platform does not encrypt private chat conversations, the company can monitor and moderate them.",
      "However, Murrill said there is no age minimum or substantial age verification process once a user signs up. As a result, young children, teens and adults posing as children can sign up, she said.",
      "The company says on its website that age verification \"is a new feature that is currently in testing on Roblox.\u201d Last month, it launched a feature that requires teenagers aged 13 to 17 to send a video selfie to verify their ages if they want to chat freely with people they know, called \u201ctrusted connections.\u201d",
      "Amid mounting criticism in recent months, the company has implemented additional measures that it says will keep their young users safe.",
      "In August, Roblox told AP that it was rolling out an artificial intelligence system to help detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitive language. Roblox said the system led it to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025.",

    "story": [
      "Small-scale solar panels about the size of a door are poised to be plugged into more U.S. homes and apartments as homeowners and renters who want to harness the sun\u2019s energy look for cheaper alternatives to rooftop installations",
      "When Terrence Dwyer received a knock on his door and a flyer for a solar panel system small enough to fit on his deck, he was quickly sold. Solar systems that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years and are gaining traction in the U.S. for their affordability and simple installation.",
      "\u201cWe thought absolutely, let\u2019s do this right away,\u201d said Dwyer, who lives in Oakland, California.",
      "These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. The systems about the size of a door haven\u2019t been as widely adopted in the U.S. as in Europe because of lack of awareness, patchwork utility rules and limited availability.",
      "The $2,000 plug-in solar system installed on Dwyer's backyard deck in March consists of two 400 watt panels, an inverter, a smart meter and a circuit breaker. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation.",
      "\u201cWe like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,\u201d Dwyer said.",
      "Had Dwyer opted for rooftop solar, he would have paid $20,000 for the system and $30,000 to upgrade his roof to support the panels.",
      "Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework. What power companies let customers do with energy-generating equipment varies, which is why prospective purchasers should check their utility\u2019s policies first. Building permits might be required depending on the municipality. Some systems can be self-installed, while others may require an electrician. For example, some kits have meters that must be wired into a home's circuit breaker.",
      "Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar. In addition to the type Dwyer bought, the company also offers a smaller model costing $399 that recently sold out in six days.",
      "\u201cThe interest and demand have been overwhelming,\u201d said Cora Stryker, a founder of Bright Saver. \u201cIt is clear that we are hitting a nerve \u2014 many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.\u201d",
      "Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. has been hindered by utility policies that create uncertainty about whether they're allowed and a lack of state and local policies to make clear what rules apply.",
      "Some utilities contacted by The Associated Press say plug-in solar systems require the same interconnection applications as rooftop panels that send electricity back to the wider network. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn't understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid.",
      "Still, if in doubt, a customer should follow their utility's policy.",
      "During the early days of plug-in solar's growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cUtilities really prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer of the electricity they sell,\u201d Cudd said.",
      "This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. It appears to be the only state that's passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the legislation, said the smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.",
      "\u201cEurope has these things. You can go buy them and they work and people want them. There is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have them here in the United States,\u201d Ward said.",

      "\u201cWe actually need more localities, more states putting in allowances for this type of equipment,\u201d she said.",
      "Some questions remain about how much customers could save. Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business, said the cost of some portable solar systems in the U.S. would make it hard for customers to come out ahead on their utility bills over the time they own them. He estimates the price of a $2,000 system in the U.S. works out to paying about $0.20 a kilowatt-hour over a 25-year period, which only saves people money if they have high utility costs. By comparison, Borenstein said the cost of systems sold in Europe, typically around $600, is equivalent to paying about $0.05 or $0.06 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.",
      "Baltimore resident Craig Keenan said saving money was only part of why he installed one of the smaller Bright Saver models on his balcony in July.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions that we produce as a species is very, very unsustainable for our world,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he expects the system will save him about $40 per year on utility bills, so it would take him about 10 years to recoup the cost of the kit.",
      "Keenan, a mechanical engineer, said installation took him 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "\u201cI think anyone can install this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated. It doesn\u2019t require a technical degree.\u201d",
      "Other companies selling plug-in solar kits include Texas-based Craftstrom. It has sold about 2,000 systems in the U.S. since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. The company's basic kits contain a solar panel that can fit in a backyard or other sunny space, along with equipment to maintain and regulate the flow of energy including an inverter and smart meter.",
      "Kenneth Hutchings, Craftstrom\u2019s chief revenue officer, said their U.S. sales rose this year even before the passage of the GOP tax bill, and he expects demand for plug-in solar to increase further as federal rooftop solar credits expire.",
      "The company advises customers to notify their power company before installation, but it has \"never had any pushback from any utility,\u201d said Michael Scherer, one of the founders of Craftstrom.",
      "China-based EcoFlow plans to begin selling plug-in solar systems in Utah and expand to other states if supportive legislation is passed, said Ryan Oliver, a company spokesperson.",
      "\u201cThis is an example of where technology is sort of ahead of the regulators,\u201d Oliver said, adding: \u201cAs this rolls out to more of a nationwide product, we expect it will become more mainstream as people understand it better.\"",

      "LANDOVER, Md. -- In a matchup of LSU Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks, Jayden Daniels rushed for a 14-yard touchdown in his lone possession, while Joe Burrow directed two touchdown drives in the Cincinnati Bengals\u2019 31-17 win over the Washington Commanders on Monday night.",
      "Burrow played three possessions, completing 9 of 14 passes for 62 yards. The 2020 Heisman winner found wide receiver Charlie Jones for a 4-yard touchdown reception on his final toss. Running back Chase Brown\u2019s 1-yard touchdown on fourth-and-goal capped a 58-yard drive on the opening possession at Northwest Stadium.",
      "The Bengals (1-1) planned on using their starters longer in preseason games to hopefully avoid a string of poor regular-season starts. Over two games with Burrow at quarterback, Cincinnati scored touchdowns on four of five possessions.",
      "\u201cThose are just incredibly valuable reps that usually you work out those kinks in the first couple of weeks in the regular season, and we\u2019ve worked them out the last two weeks,\u201d Burrow said.",
      "Head coach Zac Taylor had his share of nitpicks, as all coaches do, but said he likes \"where this offense and this team is at right now at this point.\u201d",
      "In Daniels\u2019 likely only preseason appearance, Washington (0-2) drove 74 yards on four plays to tie the score 7-7. Following runs of 19 and 40 yards by Deebo Samuel and Chris Rodriguez, respectively, Daniels evaded pass rushers and suspect tackling for a 14-yard dash up the middle. The reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year and 2023 Heisman recipient did not attempt a pass, nor a slide on the touchdown despite running into traffic.",
      "\u201cI'm playing football. I know everybody puts an emphasis on the preseason, but it's a game to me,\u201d Daniels said.",
      "Washington head coach Dan Quinn would prefer his star quarterback to choose caution at times in those spots, \u201cbut it is part of his game. It's what makes him a special player. \u201d",
      "Considering the Commanders played without three offensive line starters, two starting receivers, and tight end Zach Ertz, limiting Daniels\u2019 exposure to hits and a slick field courtesy of pre-game rain was probably the proper call. Terry McLaurin, a 2024 second-team All-Pro wide receiver, remains a non-participant amid a contract dispute.",
      "Rookie running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt raced for a 27-yard touchdown on Washington\u2019s second possession and finished with 46 yards on 11 carries. The seventh-round pick became a training camp sensation for the Commanders, and his scoring scamper won\u2019t dampen any enthusiasm. Rodriguez increased his chances for a rotation spot by rushing for a team-high 62 yards on six carries.",

      "\u201cI felt like I always had it,\" Howell said of his play this summer. \"It\u2019s self-belief. I knew it was in me. I just needed to walk with some confidence and I think that would translate to good golf and staying positive.",
      "This was the first U.S. Amateur final featuring two teenagers since Matt Fitzpatrick bested Oliver Goss in 2013 and Howell showed the composure of a much more experienced golfer by repeatedly making clutch putts while Herrington made repeated mistakes.",
      "Howell won 11 holes, eight of them with pars. He also responded after all four holes he lost, winning the following hole each time.",
      "Howell burst onto the scene when he qualified for the U.S. Open this year with rounds of 63-63 from the Atlanta sectional. He failed to make the cut at Oakmont but used that experience this week at The Olympic Club.",
      "He was one of 17 players to advance from a 20-man playoff to make the match play portion of the tournament, where he won all six matches.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I have known how good he is for a long time,\u201d said his father, Robert Howell. \u201cHe\u2019s had a phenomenal breakout summer.\u201d",
      "Howell won five of six holes on the front nine of the opening 18 holes \u2014 including an eagle at No. 7 \u2014 to take a four-hole lead. He increased the lead to five with a birdie on the par-5 16th hole as his steady putting helped keep Herrington at bay.",

      "Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes is putting together a Cy Young-worthy season everywhere but in the win-loss column",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Paul Skenes is a numbers nerd. Well, most of the time anyway.",
      "The Pittsburgh Pirates ace will make it a point to glance up at the ribbon boards that instantaneously spew out the data following each pitch \u2014 velocity, drop, horizontal movement \u2014 to get a feel for whether the ball is doing what he wants it to do after it leaves his hands.",
      "He considers the practice educational. A way for the former Air Force cadet who once majored in military strategy before transferring to LSU to decipher what's working and what's not during a given start.",
      "Yet there are two numbers the 23-year-old insists he isn't paying much attention to, at least publicly anyway: his personal win-loss record.",
      "Those numbers remained stuck at 7-9 following six occasionally fiery innings in what became a 5-2 victory over American League-leading Toronto on Monday night.",
      "Facing a team that entered the night with the highest batting average and fewest strikeouts in the majors \u2014 and with almost certain future Hall of Famer Max Scherzer watching intently from the Toronto dugout \u2014 Skenes allowed five hits and struck out eight.",
      "When he slowly loped, head down as always, from the mound after fanning Blue Jays third baseman Ernie Clement to end the top of the sixth, a sizable chunk of the PNC Park crowd rose to its feet.",
      "Standing ovations when Skenes is finishing up a day's work are becoming the norm.",
      "All too often during what has become a frustrating season for a last-place team, so is the result.",
      "When the Pirates failed to break a 2-2 tie in the bottom of the sixth, it meant that Skenes was left a no-decision for the 10th time in 26 starts. In nine of those starts, he's allowed two runs or fewer, one of the main reasons he could become the first starting pitcher with a losing record to claim the Cy Young.",
      "That prospect puts him at the forefront of the increasingly charged debate around whether \u201cpitcher wins\u201d are a valuable metric in determining a pitcher's actual worth, something that's not lost on him.",
      "Yet asked if the lack of \u201cWs\u201d under his name bothers him, he shrugs.",
      "Yes, he cares about winning. More specifically, he cares about the Pirates winning. Whether he gets credit for it on the days he gets the ball is beside the point.",
      "\u201cI mean definitely the fact that we have more runs than (the opponents) do at the end of the game, that\u2019s the biggest thing,\u201d Skenes said.",
      "Skenes then broke down why reliever Evan Sisk picked up his first big league victory by pitching a scoreless seventh before the Pirates took the lead for good in the bottom of the inning when Henry Davis dashed home following a wild pitch.",
      "\u201cI grinded, frankly, to get through six,\u201d Skenes said.",

      "\u201cIf I do that, there's probably a \u2018win\u2019 next to my name,\u201d he said.",
      "Instead, he stood on the top step of the dugout and watched Sisk, Kyle Nicolas and Dennis Santana get the final nine outs as the Pirates won for just the second time in nine games.",
      "Yes, getting the victory would have been cool. But there was joy in having the 28-year-old Sisk get dumped in a basket after picking up his first major-league victory following seven long seasons in the minors.",
      "As Sisk openly wondered what he might do with the ball commemorating the moment, Skenes jokingly suggested from a couple of stalls away that Sisk might not want to play catch with it.",
      "It was a rare and welcome moment of levity for a team that began the year with heightened expectations (internally anyway) before reality set in.",
      "Skenes' won-loss record isn't a reflection of his remarkable performance \u2014 he leads the majors in ERA (2.16) and is in the top six in innings, strikeouts and batting average against \u2014 but his team's offensive ineptitude.",
      "The Pirates rank at or near the bottom of the majors in nearly every major statistical category. That part of the equation is out of Skenes' control. So he is trying to focus on what he can, namely the process of navigating the rigors of a 162-game season and everything that comes with it.",
      "He's still trying to figure out how to make sure he gets enough sleep given the erratic schedule. To make sure his diet doesn't slip when the club is on the road. To consistently do all the little things behind the scenes that help him be at his best every fifth day.",
      "\u201cIf you aren\u2019t taking care of your routine and everything now, it can catch up to you in five, ten years, two years,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you can\u2019t cut corners because at some point, you\u2019re going to run out of paper.\u201d",

      "ZURICH -- FIFA President Gianni Infantino says that two incidents of alleged racist abuse which marred German Cup games are \u201cunacceptable\u201d as German police investigate.",
      "Infantino's comments came a day after Schalke's Christopher Antwi-Adjei said he was subjected to racist abuse in a cup game at Lokomotive Leipzig. He was whistled by fans throughout the match after reporting the incident to officials.",
      "In another incident, a Kaiserslautern substitute was racially abused while warming up in a game at RSV Eintracht, the team's coach said. He didn't name the player affected. Both incidents occurred as lower-league clubs from the former East Germany hosted larger teams in first-round games.",
      "\u201cIt is unacceptable that incidents have occurred at two DFB-Pokal matches in Germany,\" Infantino wrote on social media, using the German name for the competition. \u201cFootball has no place for racism or any form of discrimination.\u201d",
      "Infantino said FIFA's Players' Voice Panel would be \u201cin touch\u201d with the German soccer federation.",
      "\u201cEveryone at FIFA, The Players\u2019 Voice Panel and the whole football community stands firmly with all those impacted by these events \u2014 we are committed to ensuring that players are respected and protected, and that competition organizers and law enforcement authorities take appropriate action,\" Infantino added.",
      "Antwi-Adjei filed a complaint about the incident at Lokomotive Leipzig and police were investigating, Schalke said late Sunday. At RSV Eintracht, fans and security quickly identified the alleged perpetrator and fans of both teams chanted \u201cNazis out,\u201d German agency dpa reported.",
      "The German soccer federation's president, Bernd Neuendorf, said it had already launched its own investigations into the two games.",

      "Police said Saturday that a 47-year-old man from Liverpool was arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offense. He was released on conditional bail Monday, police said, with a stipulation that he cannot attend soccer games in Britain. Infantino has said FIFA's Players\u2019 Voice Panel would contact Semenyo.",

      "Outer space has emerged as the world's next battlefield, demonstrated by recent cyberattacks on satellites blamed on Russia",
      "WASHINGTON -- As Russia held its Victory Day parade this year, hackers backing the Kremlin hijacked an orbiting satellite that provides television service to Ukraine.",
      "Instead of normal programing, Ukrainian viewers saw parade footage beamed in from Moscow: waves of tanks, soldiers and weaponry. The message was meant to intimidate, and it was also an illustration that 21st century war is waged not just on land, sea and air but also in cyberspace and the reaches of outer space.",
      "Disabling a satellite could deal a devastating blow without a single bullet, and it can be done by targeting the satellite's security software or disrupting its ability to send or receive signals from Earth.",
      "\u201cIf you can impede a satellite's ability to communicate, you can cause a significant disruption,\u201d said Tom Pace, CEO of NetRise, a cybersecurity firm focused on protecting supply chains. He served in the Marines before working on cyber issues at the Department of Energy.",
      "\u201cThink about GPS,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if a population lost that, and the confusion it would cause.\u201d",
      "More than 12,000 operating satellites now orbit the planet, playing a critical role not just in broadcast communications but also in military operations, navigation systems like GPS, intelligence gathering and economic supply chains. They are also key to early launch-detection efforts, which can warn of approaching missiles.",
      "That makes them a significant national security vulnerability, and a prime target for anyone looking to undermine an adversary's economy or military readiness \u2014 or to deliver a psychological blow like the hackers supporting Russia did when they hijacked television signals to Ukraine.",
      "Hackers typically look for the weakest link in the software or hardware that supports a satellite or controls its communications with Earth. The actual orbiting device may be secure, but if it's running on outdated software, it can be easily exploited.",
      "As Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, someone targeted Viasat, the U.S.-based satellite company used by Ukraine's government and military. The hack, which Kyiv blamed on Moscow, used malware to infect tens of thousands of modems, creating an outage affecting wide swaths of Europe.",
      "National security officials say Russia is developing a nuclear, space-based weapon designed to take out virtually every satellite in low-Earth orbit at once. The weapon would combine a physical attack that would ripple outward, destroying more satellites, while the nuclear component is used to fry their electronics.",
      "U.S. officials declassified information about the weapon after Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, issued a public warning about the technology. Turner has pushed for the Department of Defense to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on the weapon, which, if deployed, would violate an international treaty prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space.",
      "Turner said such a weapon could render low-Earth orbit unusable for satellites for as long as a year. If it were used, the effects would be devastating: potentially leaving the U.S. and its allies vulnerable to economic upheaval and even a nuclear attack.",
      "Russia and China also would lose satellites, though they are believed to be less reliant on the same kinds of satellites as the U.S.",
      "Turner compared the weapon, which is not yet ready for deployment, to Sputnik, the Russian satellite that launched the space age in 1957.",
      "\u201cIf this anti-satellite nuclear weapon would be put in space, it would be the end of the space age,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt should never be permitted to go into outer space. This is the Cuban Missile Crisis in space.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Britain abandoned its demand that Apple provide so-called backdoor access to any encrypted user data stored in the cloud, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Monday.",
      "Gabbard indicated London and Washington had resolved their high-stakes dispute over electronic privacy, writing on X that she and President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance spent the \u201cpast few months\u201d working with the U.K. government.",

      "The British government reportedly served Apple with what is known as a \u201ctechnical capability notice\u201d ordering it to provide the access under a sweeping law called the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which has been dubbed the snoopers\u2019 charter.",
      "The U.K. Home Office did not respond directly to Gabbard's statement, saying it \u201cdoes not comment on operational matters, including confirming or denying the existence of such notices.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have long had joint security and intelligence arrangements with the US to tackle the most serious threats such as terrorism and child sexual abuse, including the role played by fast-moving technology in enabling those threats,\" the office said. \"We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe.\u201d",

      "In San Francisco Bay, salt ponds created more than a century ago are reverting to marshland. Along the New York and New Jersey coasts, beaches ravaged by Superstorm Sandy underwent extensive restoration. In Alabama, a rebuilt spit of land is shielding a historic town and providing wildlife habitat.",
      "Coastal communities nationwide are ramping up efforts to fend off rising seas, higher tides and stronger storm surges that are chewing away at coastlines, pushing saltwater farther inland and threatening ecosystems and communities.",
      "The need for coastal restoration has been in the spotlight this month after Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project because of objections from the fishing industry and concerns about rising costs. The Mid-Barataria project was projected to rebuild more than 20 square miles (32 square kilometers) of land over about 50 years by diverting sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River.",
      "But work continues on many other projects in Louisiana and around the country, including barrier islands, saltwater marshes, shellfish reefs and other natural features that provided protection before they were destroyed or degraded by development. Communities are also building flood walls, berms and levees to protect areas that lack adequate natural protection.",
      "The work has become more urgent as climate change causes more intense and destructive storms and leads to sea-level rise that puts hundreds of communities and tens of millions of people at risk, scientists say.",
      "\u201cThe sooner we can make these coastlines more resilient the better,\u201d said Doug George, a geological oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "In the U.S., perhaps nowhere is more vulnerable than the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast. Louisiana alone has lost more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of coastline \u2014 more than any other state \u2014 over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Historically, sediment deposited by the Mississippi and other rivers rebuilt land and nourished shore-buffering marshes. But that function was disrupted by the construction of channels and levees, along with other development.",
      "The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people \u2014 followed closely by Hurricane Rita.",
      "Afterward, the state formed the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to lessen risks from storm surges and stem land loss.",
      "Most of the almost $18 billion spent in the past 20 years was to shore up levees, flood walls and other structures, the authority said.",
      "Dozens of other projects are completed, planned or underway, including rebuilding marshes and other habitat with sediment dredged from waterways and restoring river flow to areas that have lacked it for years.",
      "On Louisiana\u2019s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state\u2019s 2029 coastal master plan.",
      "The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been \u201cdying for over a century\u201d because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said.",
      "Sediment dredged from elsewhere also has been pumped into thousands of acres of sinking marshes to nourish them and raise their levels.",
      "The same is happening in other states.",
      "In Bayou La Batre, Alabama \u2014 a fishing village built in the late 1700s \u2014 The Nature Conservancy built breakwaters offshore, then pumped in sediment and built ridges, now covered with vegetation. That created a \u201cspeed bump\u201d that has helped protect the town from erosion, said Judy Haner, the Alabama Nature Conservancy\u2019s coastal programs director.",
      "The conservancy and others also have been creating miles of oyster reefs, and are acquiring tracts of land away from the coast to allow habitats to move as seawater encroaches.",

      "Habitat restoration, not climate change, was the primary consideration when planning began about 20 years ago to restore marshland along the south end of San Francisco Bay, destroyed when ponds were created to harvest sea salt.",
      "But as sediment naturally fills in ponds and marsh plants return, \u201cwe're realizing that ... marshes absorb wave energy, storm surge and the force of high tides,\u201d said Dave Halsing, executive project manager at the California State Coastal Conservancy.",

      "James has been a leading antagonist of Trump, a Republican, and has sued him dozens of times. Last week, The Associated Press and other news outlets reported that the Justice Department has subpoenaed James as part of an investigation into whether she violated Trump's civil rights, according to people familiar with the matter.",

      "DENVER -- Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.",
      "The Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Arizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won't face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.",
      "Decades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.",
      "Meanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.",
      "The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn't exist in today's climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.",
      "Fairly splitting the river's water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.",
      "Mandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\" said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.",
      "\u201cIf we are going to be able to have a sustainable Colorado River and not just be responding to crisis after crisis, we need large amounts of flexibility built into this new set of guidelines,\" he said.",

      "DENVER -- A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked \u2014 the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.",
      "The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.",
      "Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including \u201cFrankenstein bunnies,\u201d \u201cdemon rabbits\u201d and \u201czombie rabbits.\u201d But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.",
      "The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.",

      "\"People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat,\" said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University.",
      "The top three individual actions that help the climate, including avoiding plane flights, choosing not to get a dog and using renewable electricity, were also the three that participants underestimated the most. Meanwhile, the lowest-impact actions were changing to more efficient appliances and swapping out light bulbs, recycling, and using less energy on washing clothes. Those were three of the top four overestimated actions in the report.",
      "Vlasceanu said marketing focuses more on recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs than on why flights or dog adoption are relatively bad for the climate, so participants were more likely to give those actions more weight.",

So that\u2019s why we don\u2019t associate emissions with flying,\u201d said Jiaying Zhao, who teaches psychology and sustainability at the University of British Columbia.",
      "Zhao added it's easier to bring actions to mind that we do more often. \u201cRecycling is an almost daily action, whereas flying is less frequent. It\u2019s less discussed,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, people give a higher psychological weight to recycling.\u201d",

      "Dogs are big meat eaters, and meat is a significant contributor to climate change. That is because many of the farm animals, which will become food, release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Beef is especially impactful, in part because around the world cattle are often raised on land that was illegally deforested. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas, cutting them to then raise cattle is a double whammy.",

A round-trip economy-class flight on a 737 from New York to Los Angeles produces more than 1,300 pounds of emissions per passenger, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency.",
      "Skipping that single flight saves about as much carbon as swearing off eating all types of meat a year, or living without a car for more than three months, according to U.N. estimates.",
      "Switching to energy that comes from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, has a large positive impact because such sources don't emit greenhouse gases. Some of the biggest climate decisions individuals can make include how they heat and cool their homes and the types of transportation they use. Switching to renewable energy minimizes the impact of both.",
      "Recycling is effective at reducing waste headed for landfill, but its climate impact is relatively small because transporting, processing and repurposing recyclables typically relies on fossil fuels. Plus, less than 10% of plastics actually get recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Other decisions with overestimated impact, including washing clothes in cold water and switching to more efficient light bulbs, are relatively less important. That is because those appliances have a relatively small impact compared to other things, such plane flights and dogs, so improving on them, while beneficial, has a much more limited influence.",

      "Attendance has fallen in some school systems since the crackdown began.",
      "Many of the nation\u2019s school districts are returning to the classroom with immigrant families fearful of the Trump administration's targeting of undocumented migrants, according to educators, experts and parents who spoke to ABC News.",
      "Los Angeles and Chicago\u2019s school districts -- the nation\u2019s second- and third-largest public school systems, respectively -- have returned with new guidance and protections for immigrant families wary of the federal government\u2019s measures to curb illegal immigration.",
      "Chicago Public Schools (CPS) said it will prohibit Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents or federal law enforcement from accessing its facilities unless the agents produce a criminal warrant signed by a federal judge.",
      "More than half a million Los Angeles Unified students are back in school with the district\u2019s police force partnering with local law enforcement in an effort to protect its immigrant students. LAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho stressed the district will provide students with a safe space \"regardless of immigration status.\"",
      "This comes as immigrants nationwide are afraid of deportation from school campuses as the administration continues to tout its signature campaign promise.",
      "During the first several months of the president\u2019s second term, Esmeralda Alday, former executive director of dual language and English as a second language migrant education for the San Antonio Independent School District, said fear permeated through the immigrant families in her district unlike anything she had seen before.",
      "Some mixed-status families -- where one or both parents are undocumented but the kids are U.S. citizens -- unenrolled from the district after Trump took office, according to Alday. She said it was not only due to the perceived threats from ICE but some families also received detention orders in the mail.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s coming at our families from every angle,\u201d Alday told ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting our families from all angles, almost leaving them with no choice but to self deport.\u201d",
      "ImmSchools co-founder Viridiana Carrizales told ABC News that these families now dread dropping their kids off at school -- some won't even leave their homes -- because they risk being detained. She claimed that the administration is not only targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal records but immigrants at large.",
      "\"They don\u2019t want our kids,\u201d Carrizales said. \u201cThey don't want immigrant kids in schools, they don't want them to get educated and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. We have parents who are not taking their kids to school, we have parents who are withdrawing their kids from programs that are critical for their children,\" she added.",
      "Carrizales, whose organization partners with school districts to create more welcoming and safe schools for K-12 immigrant students, said, \u201cNot having these kids receive the support that they need is going to end up hurting us all.\"",

      "But as families and school officials brace for potential crackdowns this school year, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News that no arrests have been made on K-12 school grounds during Trump's second term and ICE has yet to raid any K-12 campuses. According to McLaughlin, the majority of DHS' arrests so far either have prior criminal convictions or pending criminal charges against them.",
      "McLaughlin also warned that no K-12 students who are U.S. citizens should fear deportation or ICE raids, even if their parents are undocumented.",
      "\"If you are here in the United States legally, there's no immigration enforcement, because you're here in the country legally,\" she said.",
      "In Trump\u2019s first full day back in office, DHS lifted its longstanding restrictions that kept ICE from conducting raids on schools and other sensitive areas, including churches and hospitals. McLaughlin said the decision was made to ensure immigration agents weren't hamstrung from doing their jobs.",
      "\"This actually should be a good thing for all communities,\" she said. \"Why would you want a criminal to take safe harbor in a hospital or house of worship or a school? I mean, why would you want someone to go 'Oh, they won't get me here, so I'm going to go and take safe harbor there.'\"",
      "During the last school year and more recently during summer learning, Carrizales and Alday said student absenteeism spiked in Texas school districts because of fear of federal law enforcement. As the fears continue, many schools are concerned that projected enrollment for this school year could drop, according to Carrizales.",
      "Attendance has also plagued LAUSD, board member Tanya Ortiz Franklin said. Families are now navigating the virtual learning options the district offers.",
      "Franklin said undocumented families have heightened anxiety about visiting schools during back-to-school night and other parent-teacher obligations.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re struggling with the question of do I come to this one event that could be helpful for my child or do I ensure that I am here for them when they get home at the end of the day and it\u2019s a no brainer for those who are genuinely fearful,\u201d Franklin told ABC News.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s permeating brown communities, in particular, [and] our Black immigrant communities, our Asian immigrant communities, of which there are many in Los Angeles,\u201d she added.",

      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "Witcover lived in Washington with his second wife, Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, a biographer of the journalist H.L. Mencken. His first marriage, of nearly four decades, to Marian Laverty, ended in divorce.",
      "\"Jules was the hardest working newsman I ever knew,\" said Walter Mears, who as the chief political writer for The Associated Press traveled extensively with Witcover. \"On the road, you could hear him banging the typewriter before dawn, working on one of his books.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says the U.S. could support a European force in Ukraine to maintain a lasting peace in Russia's war",
      "WASHINGTON -- During their second meeting in the Oval Office this year, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would be willing to support European efforts to police any peace deal in Ukraine, while its leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude and wore dressier clothes.",
      "And Vice President JD Vance kept his mouth shut.",
      "As Trump hosted Zelenskyy and top European leaders to energize months of stalled U.S.-led efforts to halt Russia's 3 1/2-year-old war, the tone and style of the sit-down was far different than when Ukraine's president was hounded out of the White House in February.",
      "Following the talks, Trump called and spoke at length to Russian President Vladimir Putin who got the red carpet treatment at a summit with Trump last Friday in Alaska, to discuss the extraordinary gathering of allies. Trump said he would now work to arrange a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin.",
      "Here are key takeaways:",
      "A central question for peace talks is how to prevent further Russian aggression in the future.",
      "Trump has ruled out allowing Ukraine to join NATO, which would extend the military alliance\u2019s protection to the besieged country. He did, however, express support for security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 though details remain vague.",
      "European countries \u201cwant to give protection and they feel very strongly about it and we\u2019ll help them out with that,\u201d Trump said.",
      "That pleased Zelenskyy, who said the U.S. was offering \"such (a) strong signal.\u201d",
      "With Europeans looking to set up a force that could backstop any peace agreement in Ukraine, Trump suggested that Putin would be open to accepting security guarantees. His special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Sunday that Moscow was open to accepting NATO-style protections for Ukraine.",
      "European leaders applauded that notion, and the larger meaning it would carry.",
      "\u201cWhen we speak about security guarantees, we speak about the whole security of the European continent,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said.",
      "Macron said talks to determine what the U.S. is willing to provide will start as soon as Tuesday.",
      "The Europeans came to show a united front on Ukraine, and many used public comments to heap praise on Trump. That was striking given tensions over Trump\u2019s threats to impose steep tariffs and other issues.",
      "Ahead of their meeting, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called Trump \u201cdear Donald\u201d and said of fighting in Ukraine: \u201dIf we play this well, we could end it.\u201d In an interview later with Fox News Channel, Rutte called Trump \u201camazing\u201d and said potential swaps of Ukrainian territory weren\u2019t discussed.",
      "\"First, we need full clarity on security guidelines,\u201d Rutte said. Though Ukraine might not have NATO membership, he noted, there would be discussions for security guarantees similar to those extended to members of the alliance.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said after the meeting that there was \u201creal progress\u201d and a \u201creal sense of unity.\u201d",
      "Before the leaders spoke privately at the White House, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said all the parties were working together on \u201ca just and lasting peace.\u201d",
      "Offering a more measured tone was German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said \u201cthe path is open now\u201d to halting the fighting but next steps are \u201cmore complicated.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s try to put pressure on Russia,\u201d Merz said, adding that he would like to see a ceasefire come together.",
      "Trump was noncommittal, saying, \u201cIf we can do the ceasefire, great,\u201d but suggested it was far from a dealbreaker. He dropped his push for a ceasefire after Friday's summit, aligning with Putin\u2019s position that negotiations should focus on a long-term peace settlement instead.",

      "Still, much remains unresolved, including red lines that are incompatible \u2014 like whether Ukraine will cede any land to Russia, the future of Ukraine\u2019s army and whether the country will ultimately have lasting and meaningful security guarantees.",
      "Trump said he had begun arrangements for a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy. But Russian foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said only that Putin and Trump had a 40-minute phone call and \u201cspoke in favor\u201d of continuing direct talks between the sides, Russian state news agency Tass reported.",
      "Outside the White House, Zelenskyy said no date had been set for such a meeting but that the U.S. suggested it be as soon as possible.",

      "Though many European leaders oppose forgoing a possible ceasefire on the road to seeking lasting peace, they have supported a meeting by Trump, Zelenskyy and Putin in the meantime. Macron suggested that another summit could feature the three presidents and also top European leaders.",

      "DHS said the agents were conducting a \u201ctargeted enforcement operation\u201d but provided no details about why they were targeting the unidentified man. The incident occurred just before 9 a.m. in San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles.",
      "Javier Hernandez, executive director of the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, spoke to the man\u2019s family and provided their account of the incident, a portion of which was captured on video by the driver's son and son-in-law who were in the vehicle.",
      "Hernandez did not disclose the 43-year-old driver's name, and DHS did not identify him. Hernandez said the man is from Mexico, has been in the U.S. for 23 years and does not have legal status. The 18-year-old son and 23-year-old son-in-law are U.S. citizens, Hernandez said.",
      "On the videos, the uniformed officers are wearing masks and have \u201cpolice\u201d written on vests. At least one is wearing a hat labeled CBP, for Customs and Border Protection.

      "The Menendez brothers are set to make their cases for parole this week",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Menendez brothers are set to make their cases for parole starting Thursday, marking the closest they've been to winning freedom from prison since their convictions almost 30 years ago for murdering their parents.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. They were 18 and 21 at the time. While defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance.",
      "The brothers became eligible for parole after a Los Angeles judge in May reduced their sentences from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole under California law because they were under the ages of 26 when they committed their crimes.",
      "A panel or two or three parole hearing officers from a board of commissioners appointed by the governor will evaluate the brothers individually. Erik Menendez will have his hearing Thursday morning, followed by Lyle Menendez on Friday, over videoconference from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.",
      "The board will assess whether the brothers pose an \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to society\u201d if released, considering factors like criminal history, motivation for the crime and signs of remorse, behavior while in prison and plans for the future, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Even if the board grants their parole, it could still be months before the brothers walk free \u2014 if at all. If the board grants each brother's parole, the chief legal counsel has 120 days to review the case. Then Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has 30 days to affirm or deny the parole. Only then, if Newsom affirms the parole, would the Menendez brothers be able to leave prison.",
      "Newsom had previously ordered the state parole board to conduct a risk assessment of the brothers in response to a clemency request. At the time, he emphasized that the key question was whether the brothers posed an \u201cunreasonable risk to public safety.\u201d",
      "He noted at a May news conference that he has both approved and rejected decisions by the parole board before and that he was the \u201cultimate arbiter.\u201d",
      "The brothers' lawyer, Mark Geragos, sought release last month for Erik Menendez after he was hospitalized for a \u201cserious medical condition.\u201d He has since returned to prison.",

      "In the last year, weigh-in from celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and a greater recognition of the brothers as victims of sexual abuse has helped amass a legion of supporters who have called for their release. Some have flown to Los Angeles over the past few months, holding rallies and attending court hearings as the brothers' attorneys pushed for their resentencing.",
      "The previous LA County district attorney, George Gasc\u00f3n, first opened the door to possible freedom for the brothers last fall by asking a judge to reduce their sentences. Since their conviction, the brothers have gotten an education, participated in self-help classes and started various support groups for fellow people in prison, his office said in a petition.",
      "The judge\u2019s decision to ultimately resentence the brothers followed months of pushback from current prosecutors, who argued the brothers hadn\u2019t taken adequate responsibility for their crimes.",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama has scheduled an October execution by nitrogen gas for an inmate who has an ongoing lawsuit challenging the new method as unconstitutionally cruel.",
      "Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Monday set an Oct. 23 execution date for Anthony Boyd, 53. Boyd is one of four men convicted in the 1993 killing of Gregory Huguley in Talladega. Prosecutors said Huguley was burned to death after he failed to pay for $200 worth of cocaine.",
      "Boyd's lawsuit challenges the use of nitrogen hypoxia gas as unconstitutionally cruel. He suggested a firing squad, hanging or medical aid-in-dying as better alternatives. A federal judge has scheduled a Sept. 4 hearing in the case.",
      "Alabama began using nitrogen gas last year to carry out some executions. The method uses a gas mask to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing the inmate to die from lack of oxygen.",
      "Alabama has used nitrogen to carry out five executions and has another planned in September. Louisiana has used nitrogen to carry out one execution.",
      "In 2018, Boyd selected nitrogen as his preferred execution method, but at the time the state had not developed procedures for using it. Lawyers for Boyd filed a federal lawsuit in July \u2014 about a month after the state began asking for his execution date \u2014 seeking to prevent the state from executing him with nitrogen. They cited descriptions of how other inmates shook on the gurney while being executed with nitrogen gas.",
      "\u201cEach prisoner previously executed by the State\u2019s Protocol showed signs of conscious suffocation, terror, and pain,\u201d lawyers for Boyd wrote in the lawsuit.",
      "The Rev. Jeff Hood, a spiritual adviser who witnessed the first nitrogen execution and is now working with Boyd, said Monday that he was \u201chorrified\u201d by what he saw at that execution, which he described as being \u201csuffocated to death.\u201d",
      "The Alabama attorney general\u2019s office has urged a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that there is \u201csubstantial evidence that nitrogen hypoxia is a painless way to die.\u201d",
      "The state argued the described movements in previous executions were either inmates actively resisting or \u201cinvoluntary movements associated with dying.\u201d",
      "Huguley\u2019s burned body was found Aug. 1, 1993, in a rural ballpark in Talladega County. Prosecutors said that the night before, the men had kidnapped Huguley after he failed to pay for $200 in cocaine.",

      "Missouri's attorney general is resigning to take a leadership position with the FBI",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican who has been an ardent backer of President Donald Trump, said Monday that he is resigning to take a leadership position at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.",
      "The move is the latest in a series of changes at the FBI under Director Kash Patel. Numerous senior officials, including top agents in charge of big-city field offices, have been pushed out of their jobs, and Justice Department officials have sought the names of agents who participated in investigations related to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Bailey said he is stepping down effective Sept. 8 to serve as the FBI's co-deputy director, alongside Dan Bongino. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe is to announce a new appointee as attorney general on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cMy life has been defined by a call to service, and I am once again answering that call, this time at the national level,\u201d Bailey said in a statement.",
      "In a little over two-and-a-half years in the job, Bailey pursued numerous lawsuits challenging former President Joe Biden's administration on an array of policies, including immigration actions,student loan forgiveness,environmental rules,gun safety initiatives and transgender rights measures.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Tourism in Las Vegas is slumping this summer, with resorts and convention centers reporting fewer visitors compared to last year, especially from abroad, and some officials are blaming the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and immigration policies for the decline.",
      "The city known for lavish shows, endless buffets and around-the-clock gambling welcomed just under 3.1 million tourists in June, an 11% drop compared to the same time in 2024. There were 13% fewer international travelers, and hotel occupancy fell by about 15%, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",
      "Mayor Shelley Berkley said tourism from Canada \u2014 Nevada's largest international market \u2014 has dried up from a torrent \u201cto a drip.\u201d Same with Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of very high rollers that come in from Mexico that aren\u2019t so keen on coming in right now. And that seems to be the prevailing attitude internationally,\u201d Berkley told reporters earlier this month.",
      "Ted Pappageorge, head of the powerful Culinary Workers Union, called it the \u201cTrump slump.\u201d He said visits from Southern California, home to a large Latino population, were also drying up because people are afraid of the administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cIf you if you tell the rest of the world they\u2019re not welcome, then they won\u2019t come,\u201d Pappageorge said.",
      "Canadian airline data shows fewer passengers from north of the border are arriving at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. Air Canada saw its passenger numbers fall by 33% in June compared to the same time a year ago, while WestJet had a 31% drop. The low-cost carrier Flair reported a whopping 62% decline.",
      "Travel agents in Canada said there's been a significant downturn in clients wanting to visit the U.S. overall, and Las Vegas in particular. Wendy Hart, who books trips from Windsor, Ontario, said the reason was \u201cpolitics, for sure.\u201d She speculated that it was a point of \u201cnational pride\u201d that people were staying away from the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are a big thing too. They seem to be contributing to the rising cost of everything,\u201d Hart said.",
      "At downtown's Circa Resort and Casino, international visits have dipped, especially from Canada and Japan, according to owner and CEO Derek Stevens. But the downturn comes after a post-COVID spike, Stevens said. And while hotel room bookings are slack, gaming numbers, especially for sports betting, are still strong, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's not as if the sky is falling,\u201d he said. Wealthier visitors are still coming, he said, and Circa has introduced cheaper package deals to lure those with less money to spend.",
      "\u201cThere have been many stories written about how the \u2018end is near\u2019 in Vegas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Vegas continues to reinvent itself as a destination worth visiting.\u201d",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Voter registration records for more than 20,000 people in North Carolina have been successfully amended thus far in an effort by election officials to add missing identification numbers.",
      "In mid-July, the State Board of Elections began formally an effort that seeks to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department that focused on voter registration records that lacked either a voter's driver\u2019s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Federal and state laws have directed that election officials request this ID information since 2004, but for about a decade the state\u2019s registration form failed to make clear that voters were supposed to provide it if they had it.",
      "A \u201d Registration Repair Project\u201d supported by the now Republican-controlled state board \u2014 flipped from a Democratic majority in the spring \u2014 created a public online database with the names of 103,270 registrants the lacking the numerical identifiers. They were asked to provide an ID number through the Division of Motor Vehicles website or by visiting their county election board offices. County election officials also have conducted research to update records.",
      "As of Monday, the registrants on the list had fallen 20% to 82,540, an election board news release said.",
      "As planned, the board is now sending letters to those who haven't already acted and offered a numerical ID, or have yet to indicate that they have neither a driver's license nor a Social Security number. The letter recipients are being told they can mail in their ID number with postage-paid return envelopes provided, in addition to the DMV and in-person options.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quick. It\u2019s easy. It\u2019s free,\u201d board Executive Director Sam Hayes said, adding that taking action now will \"avoid any issues the next time they show up to vote.\u201d",

The board release said that paper and electronic voter rolls will flag these voters so they vote with a provisional ballot and provide missing information for their ballot to count.",
      "The missing numerical IDs led to other complaints and litigation leading to the 2024 elections and played a prominent part in a very close judicial race. U.S. attorneys have contended that accurate registration rolls help ensure fair and reliable election results. Many Democrats said these voters are already being scrutinized because they already have to show a photo ID to vote like everyone else.",
      "North Carolina has 7.57 million registered voters and is considered a perpetual battleground state. Close elections could be affected if registrants cast ballots that ultimately aren't counted.",
      "Another mailing will go out at a later date to close to 100,000 additional voters whose records also lack the identifiers but will be allowed to continue casting regular ballots because there\u2019s evidence, for example, that they supplied a number or an alternate ID as allowed under the law.",

      "His behavior was so problematic that one Washington State University faculty member told co-workers that if he ever became a professor, he would likely stalk or sexually abuse his future students, according to the documents. She urged her co-workers to cut Kohberger's funding to remove him from the program.",

She continued, \u201cMark my word, I work with predators, if we give him a Ph.D., that's the guy that in in that many years when he is a professor, we will hear is harassing, stalking, and sexually abusing ... his students at wherever university.\u201d",

      "The WSU faculty member told investigators that Kohberger would sometimes go into an office where several female grad students worked, physically blocking the door. Sometimes, she would hear one of the women say, \u201cI really need to get out of here,\u201d so she would intercede by going into the office to allow the student to leave.",
      "The faculty member believed Kohberger was stalking people. She told police that someone had reportedly broken into a female graduate student's apartment in September or October, stealing perfume and underwear.",
      "An unnamed Ph.D. student who was in the same program as Kohberger told police that he enjoyed conflict, was disparaging toward women and that he especially liked to talk about sexual burglary \u2014 his field of study.",

      "The woman \u201csaid she had never met anyone who acted in such a condescending manner and wondered why people in power in the department did not address his behavior,\u201d Van Leuven wrote. \u201cThe way he spoke to females in the department was unsettling to them.\u201d",

      "The judges of the Southern District of New York have approved Jay Clayton to remain as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan will get to stay in the job, even though he hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the U.S. Senate, after a group of judges voted Monday to allow him to continue in the position.",
      "The judges\u2019 decision to approve Jay Clayton as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York is a victory for the Trump administration, which has resorted to unorthodox maneuvers to keep some of the president\u2019s other nominees for U.S. attorneys in place after they failed to advance in the Senate.",
      "The outcome was announced in a release by Southern District Executive Edward Friedland. It said Clayton will serve as U.S. attorney unless someone else is nominated by Trump and approved by the Senate.",
      "Clayton, who served as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission between 2017 and 2020, has deep-rooted Wall Street ties and over two decades of experience at a prominent international law firm, although he never was a prosecutor before taking the position four months ago.",
      "In a statement, Clayton said: \u201cI am honored to continue serving the people of New York together with the talented and hardworking women and men of the Office.\u201d",
      "The approval came after several other U.S. attorneys across the country who were appointed by the Trump administration were unable to gain the approval of judges in their districts.",
      "The Manhattan prosecutor\u2019s office has undergone turmoil in recent months after several prosecutors, including then interim U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, resigned after refusing to carry out orders from the Justice Department to drop corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams. The case was eventually dropped after prosecutors from Washington submitted a request to a judge.",
      "Another assistant U.S. attorney, Maurene Comey, was recently fired shortly after she handled the bulk of duties in the trial of hip-hop producer Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs. He was acquitted of the most serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges, though he remains jailed and awaiting sentencing for his conviction on prostitution-related charges.",
      "Clayton has maintained a relatively low profile while heading an office of prosecutors long known for its independence from Washington.",
      "The decision on Clayton came after judges in several other federal jurisdictions across the country rejected the person chosen by the Trump administration as U.S. attorney, causing the administration to employ other legal maneuvers to keep its pick in place.",
      "The administration\u2019s appointments normally would face Senate approval, but Democratic senators in their home states can block the usual process, as several have done. That lets the appointed top prosecutor serve 120 days before the district\u2019s federal judges decide whether the individual can remain in the post. The judges can also appoint a successor.",
      "In the past, it was considered rare for judges to reject the appointed top prosecutor in their district, but several rejections have occurred this year.",

      "In New Jersey, federal judges rejected the appointment of former Trump defense attorney Alina Habba, choosing an interim top federal prosecutor in the state instead. Attorney General Pam Bondi responded by firing the judges\u2019 chosen successor and reinstalling Habba as acting U.S. attorney.",
      "Habba\u2019s tenure still faces uncertainty, though, after a lawsuit challenging the legality of the administration\u2019s move to keep her in place awaited a ruling this week by a Pennsylvania federal judge. The Justice Department says the president is entitled to name the person he wants to the position.",
      "Unlike Clayton, who has remained relatively controversy-free in the runup to the judges\u2019 vote, Sarcone and Habba attracted headlines during their tenures.",
      "In June, Sarcone said he was attacked by a knife-wielding man from El Salvador outside an Albany hotel. The man, who lacked documentation to be in the country, was initially charged with attempted second-degree murder, but prosecutors downgraded the charge after reviewing video surveillance footage and the man pleaded guilty to menacing.",
      "Habba brought a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption when U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver was charged with assault for allegedly making physical contact with law enforcement officials when Newark\u2019s mayor was arrested during a chaotic visit to a privately operated immigration detention center. McIver denied assaulting anyone.",

      "\u201cEvery eruption feels like I am sitting in the front row at nature\u2019s most extraordinary show,\u201d Wei said in an email.",
      "Kilauea is on Hawaii Island, the largest of the Hawaiian archipelago. It\u2019s about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of the state\u2019s largest city, Honolulu, which is on Oahu.",
      "Here's what to know about Kilauea's latest eruption:",
      "A lower magma chamber under Halemaumau Crater is receiving magma directly from the earth\u2019s interior about 5 cubic yards (3.8 cubic meters) per second, said Ken Hon, the scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcanoes Observatory. This blows the chamber up like a balloon and forces magma into an upper chamber. From there, it gets pushed above ground through cracks.",
      "Magma has been using the same pathway to rise to the surface since December, making the initial release and subsequent episodes all part of the same eruption, Hon said.",
      "Many have featured lava soaring into the air, in some cases more than 1,000 feet (300 meters.) The fountains are generated in part because magma \u2014 which holds gasses that are released as it rises \u2014 has been traveling to the surface through narrow, pipe-like vents.",
      "The expanding magma supply is capped by heavier magma that had expelled its gas at the end of the prior episode. Eventually enough new magma accumulates to force the degassed magma off, and the magma shoots out like champagne bottle that was shaken before the cork was popped.",
      "This is the fourth time in 200 years that Kilauea has shot lava fountains into the air in repeated episodes. There were more episodes the last time Kilauea followed this pattern: the eruption that began in 1983 started with 44 sessions of shooting fountains. Those were spread out over three years, however. And the fountains emerged in a remote area so few got to watch.",
      "The other two occurred in 1959 and 1969.",
      "Scientists don't know how the current eruption will end or how it may change. In 1983, magma built enough pressure that Kilauea opened a vent at a lower elevation and started continuously leaking lava from there rather than periodically shooting out of a higher elevation. The eruption continued in various forms for three decades and only ended in 2018.",

      "WASHINGTON -- It was only a few months ago that U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last met in the Oval Office, but Monday\u2019s face-to-face between the two leaders looked markedly different.",
      "For much of their February exchange, during which Trump and Vice President JD Vance blasted Zelenskyy as \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and warned about future American support for his country, Zelenskyy crossed his arms and looked askance at the U.S. leaders. The presidents often spoke over each other, also gesturing disagreement. A conservative reporter, Brian Glenn, even asked Zelenskyy why he wasn't wearing a suit.",
      "Monday\u2019s meeting was rounded out with more smiles and pleasantries between Trump and Zelenskyy, as well as agreement on some points regarding Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine. Both men largely sat with their hands clasped in their laps, affably fielding questions from reporters. And Glenn, when called upon by the Republican U.S. president to speak, complimented Zelenskyy, saying, \u201cYou look fabulous in that suit.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:35:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Hernandez Govan is not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claim he directed the two people who did.",
    "story": [
      "The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in November 2021 began on Monday.",
      "Hernandez Govan, 45, faces charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted murder. He is not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claim he directed the\u00a0two people\u00a0who did. He rejected the state's offer to settle with a guilty plea last month,\u00a0CBS affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "City officials and community activists pointed to the killing as a symbol of the dangers of gun violence in Memphis, where more than 300 homicides were reported that year.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed the killing as part an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, Yo Gotti.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Testifying against Govan on Monday was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the\u00a0two shooters\u00a0who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against\u00a0Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter. Smith had previously testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph, as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date. Johnson was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in September 2024.\u00a0He was later sentenced\u00a0for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "Smith testified on Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the volunteer event, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said that Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Young Dolph began his career by releasing numerous mixtapes. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, \"King of Memphis.\" He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others. Young Dolph had three albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, with 2020\u2032s \"Rich Slave\" peaking at No. 4.",
      "He was among the musical stars that The Grammy Awards paid tribute to during its memoriam segment at the 2022 awards.",
      "In a\u00a02024 interview with The Associated Press, Carlisa Brown, Young Dolph's sister, called her brother's killing a \"very senseless murder\" and added that his family wants everyone involved to get the justice they deserve.",
      "The attack that killed the rapper wasn't the first time he was targeted. In 2017, Young Dolph was approached by three men and shot over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. He was critically injured but survived. Earlier that same year, he was involved in another shooting, where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",

      "The magnetic British actor Terence Stamp (July 22, 1938-Aug. 17, 2025) earned a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his first film appearance, in 1962's \"Billy Budd.\" But he was best known for playing the supervillain General Zod in \"Superman\" and \"Superman II.\" His other major film roles included a kidnapper in \"The Collector,\" a London criminal in \"The Limey,\" and a trans woman accompanying two drag queens in a romp across the Australian Outback in the comedy \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\"",
      "Born in London, Stamp worked in advertising before pursuing an acting career. Early on, he shared an apartment with fellow up-and-coming actor Michael Caine (they also shared the same suit for auditions). After making his screen debut as the title character in \"Billy Budd,\" Stamp appeared with Laurence Olivier in \"Term of Trial,\" Monica Vitti in \"Modesty Blaise,\" and Julie Christie in \"Far From the Madding Crowd.\" He appeared in several European films (\"Teorema,\" \"Hu-Man,\" \"The Divine Nymph\"), but he spent much of the '70s on a spiritual quest in India after years of unemployment, believing he has aged out of his early, youthful roles which had played off his dashing good looks.",
      "At a 2013 British Film Institute screening, Stamp said he was living in an ashram when he got a telegram offering him the part of Zod opposite Marlon Brando. \"And I thought, my life is about to change,\" he said.",
      "His performance as the ruthless exile from Krypton who wields the same superpowers as Superman was indelible, as was his desire to dominate the Earth. Stamp claimed \"Superman\" was the only successful film he'd ever been in, but it left its mark: \"I can rarely get through the day without somebody coming up to me and saying, 'Kneel before Zod!'\" he said.",
      "His film and TV credits included \"Meetings With Remarkable Men,\" \"The Hit,\" \"Legal Eagles,\" \"The Company of Wolves,\" \"Wall Street,\" \"Young Guns,\" \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace,\" \"Bowfinger,\" \"His Dark Materials,\" \"Unfinished Song,\" \"Wanted,\" \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" \"A Song for Marion,\" \"Bitter Harvest,\" and \"Last Night in Soho.\" He spent much of his later career playing darker, villainous (but still charismatic) characters.",
      "He published several memoirs, including \"Stamp Album,\" \"Coming Attractions,\" \"Double Feature,\" and \"The Ocean Fell into the Drop.\"",
      "In 1987,\u00a0Stamp told BBC Radio's \"Desert Island Discs\": \"I have a lot of things in my head. Obviously I'm kind of, there's a lot of time when I'm fueled by kind of high-up pain. As an actor, I get a chance to express all the different things that come up out of it. And so, it's a kind of release, it's like a safety valve. The big energy can be channeled into something productive. I think if I didn't have that outlet, then I would be somebody who vacillated from terrific ups to terrific downs, and I consider that psychotic.\" He added, \"I'm lucky because I can do something with all these things that occur to me, I can channel them.\""

    "story": [
      "Laufey's music may not be what you usually think of as \"pop,\" but if pop is short for popular, then she is indeed a pop star. The 26-year-old Icelander has earned a devoted following blending modern lyrics and music with classical and jazz. \"My music is such a combination of the sounds of my childhood,\" she said. \"It's just something that's become a part of me. I wanted to make things that made me happy.",
      "\"I loved Golden Age musicals,\" said Laufey. \"I'd watch 'Carousel' and 'Oklahoma' and 'American in Paris' and 'Sound of Music.' They were so beautiful and had these dance breaks and the dresses were floating and the colors \u2013 that feeling I got from that, I just wanted to create that feeling.\"",
      "The world she inhabits (in her work, anyway) is whimsical and romantic, full of windswept cliffs, frilly dresses and bows \u2026 and cello, almost always cello.",
      "Watch Laufey perform \"I Wish You Love\" with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra:",
      "She says the cello is \"as important to me as my voice. And I think it's really what makes a Laufey song a Laufey song.\"",
      "Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir comes by it naturally. Her Icelandic father introduced her to jazz when she was a girl; her Chinese mother played classical violin. So does Laufey's identical twin sister.",
      "Growing up, she said, she felt different: \"Everyone was like, you know, going to play soccer after school or dance, and I was sitting down and playing music from the 17th century. And then on top that I was a twin, identical twin. I just feel, like, weird on top of weird, on top of weird.\"",
      "And things only got weirder when she started singing, as when she appeared on the TV competition \"Iceland's Got Talent\" singing Alicia Keys' \"If I Ain't Got You,\" at age 13: \"I remember going on singing competitions in Iceland when I was younger and they'd always be like, 'She sounds like a 40-year-old woman that's been divorced twice and she chain-smokes cigarettes,'' Laufey said. \"And I was, like, a 13-year-old girl standing on stage being like, okay, like, I just wanted to be a girl. So, yeah I was always a little bit like \u2026 felt a little bit like a circus act.\"",
      "But Laufey found her footing at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. She started posting original songs and jazz covers on social media during the pandemic, and they quickly went viral.",
      "Laufey performs \"I Love You (For Sentimental Reasons\") on guitar and cello:",
      "I asked, \"Were you surprised that people were responding to the jazz influences?\"",
      "\"I was so shocked, because I'd never seen any example of it before,\" Laufey replied. \"And I'd never seen a community of young people \u2026 that was the most shocking part, that it was young people responding to the music. But there was always a part of me that was like, of course, it's the best music in the world!\"",
      "Now she sells out just about every concert \u2013 like a recent one in Norfolk, Virginia, where one fan, Alissa, told us, \"When I first like showed, like, my parents that, they were like, 'This is what you guys listen to?' And I was like, 'Yeah, like, this is what, like, younger people are listening to!'\"",
      "Another fan, Logan, said, \"I feel like she takes just kind of more 'old people music' and pushes it into, like, a newer generation so that more people can enjoy it.\"",
      "Laufey's new album, \"A Matter of Time,\" comes out this week. A stadium tour will follow.",
      "Her songwriting usually starts on guitar, like her bossa nova-influenced \"From the Start.\"",
      "But she just as easily can weave in a little classical, as she did on her last album, \"Bewitched.\" Last year, \"Bewitched\" briefly knocked Frank Sinatra off the top of the jazz charts \u2013 and then, that album won a best traditional pop vocal Grammy Award, beating such artists as Bruce Springsteen.",
      "And then, Barbra Streisand asked Laufey to sing on her recent album of duets, performing a song Laufey wrote, \"Letter to My 13-Year-Old Self.\" \"It's one of those songs that I wrote just in my most intimate moments and could have been a song that I never put out,\" she said. \"It was a song for me to heal myself. But it's a very hopeful song. It's reaching back to tell your younger self that you're going to be okay.\"",
      "Don't you worry 'bout your curly hair Clothes that don't quite fit you anywhere Voices echo in the gym Another girl's had her first kiss Please don't think too much of it, darling",
      "I asked, \"What do you think your 13-year-old self would think of all of this?\"",
      "\"I think she'd be really excited,\" Laufey replied. \"I think she'd be really happy. There's not a single part of myself that has changed any of my artistic interests to follow some sort of trend. And I get to make exactly the music that I loved back then. So, I think I would've been really, really happy.\"",

      "Did the idea of doing it professionally cross his mind? \"100%,\" said Scott. \"In fact, I used to practice on my bed. I would set it up like a couch. I would practice being on David Letterman. I remember I had a project that I would pretend I was promoting, where Harrison Ford and I were playing father-and-son cops. I'm sure I just looked like an insane person.\"",
      "\"For what it's worth I would watch that today,\" I said.",
      "\"I know, it sounds great!\"",
      "After some success in high school plays, Scott moved to Pasadena to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he started thinking that \"Adam Scott\" didn't sound dramatic enough: \"When I was in theater school, I really fancied myself as a very serious actor in the vein of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. In fact, at one point I wanted to change my last name to Quardero. I remember writing on a piece of paper, 'Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Adam Quardero.' My mother's maiden name was Quartararo.\"",
      "Scott stuck with his last name and, after graduation, stuck it out through the high and lows of building an acting career. \"One thing I always felt that I knew about myself is that I was never going to leave,\" he said. \"I didn't have any other options. But I knew that I was just gonna stick around until something happened, something came together for me.\"",
      "Scott's five seasons on the NBC sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\" took his career to the next level, although it came with an unexpected downside: now that he was so well known for comedy, it was harder to get dramatic roles.",
      "Ben Stiller, one of the executive producers and the primary director of \"Severance,\" said of Scott, \"He'd done, you know, work that was dramatic before, it just wasn't things that, you know, people really hadn't seen as much of it as his comedy work.",
      "He believed Scott had the skills necessary to play what's essentially two roles \u2013 or at least, two parts of the same person \u2013 sometimes transitioning between his severed personalities in a single shot. \"The key to the effect working really is Adam's change of expression, and just how good he is as an actor technically,\" Stiller said. \"He has to get that timing right of the change with the camera effect, so it's not easy to do. He can take a note just, you know, adjust something, you know, minimally, that very few actors I work with can do as well as him.\"",
      "I asked Stiller, \"It seems like you saw that potential early on. Was it a tough sell for the studio to have him front the show?\"",
      "\"You know, they had a different idea in the beginning, but I said, 'Look, Adam, to me, I think he's the guy,\" Stiller replied.",
      "It's clear fans agree. As part of Apple's massive marketing push for \"Severance,\" viewers were invited to an event at the historic former Bell Labs building in Holmdel, New Jersey, which stands in for the headquarters of the show's fictional Lumon Industries.",
      "Scott said, \"Seeing the photos of this place, of the Bell Labs building, it started dawning on me just the scale of the show and what it was exactly that Ben had in mind.\"",
      "Outside of \"Severance,\" Scott's work life and home life revolve around his wife, Naomi. They produce podcasts, films, and TV shows together. They met in the late '90s, which means she's seen him through a number of career ups and downs. \"I kind of learned that there was a cycle of him, you know, picking himself up off the ground, and I did know how to nurture and encourage that,\" Naomi said. \"That, I knew how to do. But it was hard to watch.\"",
      "I asked, \"What's it been like to see people finally see what you've been seeing for all these years?\"",
      "\"Oh, it's very vindicating!\" she laughed. \"I knew it. It's great. I love it.\"",
      "Adam Scott had to audition for \"Severance,\" and fight for the role. Now, with season three already in the works, the actor who always knew he was in it for the long haul is finally getting his due. Though he recognizes that there is no \"Bank of Hollywood\" that is allowing him to cash in after making 30 years of deposits.\u00a0 \"No \u2013 you're entitled to nothing in show business, and I knew that,\" he said. \"But I also knew that there was something I could bring to it that nobody else could. And I knew that I would have to give all of myself to it in order to pull it off. I would have to use absolutely everything I've learned over 30 years if I was gonna do it right. And so, when I was lucky enough to get the job, that's exactly what I did.\"",

      "Taylor Swift's upcoming album release and her love of all things orange isn't lost on her fans \u2014 or brands that are seeking a ride on what has become an enormous economic tailwind.",
      "On Wednesday after Swift went on the \"New Heights\" podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, NFL football star Travis Kelce, to announce the imminent release of her 12th studio album \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" major companies went into marketing overdrive.",
      "Numerous corporations, from United Airlines to Olive Garden, began posting orange-hued memes on their own social media accounts soon after the new album was announced. Shake Shack, FedEx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cinnabon, Walmart and Netflix did, too.",
      "That's because Swift appeared onstage wearing orange numerous times toward the end of her Eras Tour, and discussed her feelings about the color on the Wednesday podcast.",
      "\"It feels like energetically how my life has felt,\" the 14-time Grammy winner tells co-host Jason Kelce.",
      "Many, it seemed, saw value in tying their brand to Swift.",

      "Swift's tour appearances have become economic events. The singer's Eras Tour two years ago was the first such tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts. Cities and their surrounding areas registered a sizeable economic boost after Swift appeared, with thousands of fans making the pilgrimage and spending money at hotels, restaurants and elsewhere.",
      "Swift also mentioned during the Wednesday podcast that she had Lasik eye surgery. In response, the X account for LASIK.com wasted no time promoting the fortuitous namedrop. The post had more than 450,000 views and 17,000 likes as of Friday.",
      "About 500,000 Americans undergo Lasik every year, CBS News recently reported. And while the American Refractive Surgery Council says the complication rate is less than 1%, side effects are not uncommon and should not be taken lightly by those considering the procedure.",
      "Swift's two-hour chat with the Kelce brothers marks the singer's first ever podcast interview, a milestone moment for the medium.",
      "By Thursday afternoon, Wednesday night's talk had already been seen more than 11.7 million times on YouTube. Clips distributed on Instagram, TikTok, X and elsewhere have received more than 400 million views, and the episode was also available for streaming on audio platforms.",
      "It has further to go to be a record-setter, though. The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is by a company called Thmanyah, a Saudi Arabian Arabic podcast network and independent journalism platform, according to its website. The video has racked up 144 million views in two years.",
      "Swift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work \u2014 a yearslong quest.",

      "Swift used the podcast episode to announce her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" which she was working on during the European leg of her record-breaking Eras Tour in 2024.",
      "\"This is the record I've been wanting to make for a very long time,\" Swift said.",
      "Here are more details Swift shared about the upcoming album:",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" release date",
      "The album will be released on Friday, Oct. 3. Fans of Swift know the dates she chooses to announce and release music almost always have meaning and often have a 13, her lucky number, somewhere.",
      "\"Never not annoying,\" she said about herself on the podcast. \"Always going to try to force a 13 into the situation and this one was right there.\"",
      "Swift, Max Martin and Shellback produced the album",
      "Swift made \"The Life of a Showgirl\" with Max Martin and Shellback, producers she has worked with in the past but never for the entirety of an album.",
      "\"The three of us have made some of my favorite songs that I've ever done before,\" Swift said. Those songs include \"22,\" \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" \"Blank Space,\" \"Style,\" \"Shake It Off,\" \"\u2026Ready For It?\" and \"Delicate.\"",
      "The three hadn't produced music together in seven or eight years, but returning to work with them \"felt like catching lightning in a bottle,\" Swift said.",
      "\"By the time we came back together, I feel like we had so much more dexterity to what we do,\" she said. \"This was the time where it felt like all three of us in the room were carrying the same weight as creators and it was really special.\"",
      "Martin and Shellback have also worked with pop artists like Britney Spears, Ariana Grande, P!nk and more.",
      "\"The best ideas we've ever had\"",
      "Swift said she approached Martin, who she described as her mentor, about doing an album at her Eras Tour show in Stockholm in May 2024.",
      "\"I essentially said to him, 'I want to be as proud of an album as I am of the Eras Tour and for the same reasons,' and he was like, 'Do you understand what kind of pressure that is?'\" Swift said.",
      "But Swift is confident in the outcome.",
      "\"We knew that we had to bring the best ideas we've ever had, and I also know the pressure I'm putting on this record by saying that, but I don't care because I love it that much, and I'm so proud of it, and it just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life, and so that effervescence has come through on this record,\" she said.",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" theme",
      "Swift described the theme of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" as \"everything that was going on behind the curtain\" during the Eras Tour.",
      "Asked by Jason Kelce why she chose orange for the color scheme of the album, Swift said, \"I've just always liked it, Jason.\"",
      "\"It feels like kind of energetically how my life has felt, and this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,\" she said.",
      "There are 12 songs on the album",
      "Swift shared the titles of the 12 tracks on the album: \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" \"Elizabeth Taylor,\" \"Opalite,\" \"Father Figure,\" \"Eldest Daughter,\" \"Ruin The Friendship,\" \"Actually Romantic,\" \"Wi$h Li$t,\" \"Wood,\" \"Cancelled!,\" \"Honey\" and \"The Life of a Showgirl (Feat. Sabrina Carpenter).\"",
      "The pop star added that there are no additional songs, a departure from past albums. Her most recent release, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" had 31 songs.",
      "\"Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons. \u2026 It's just right,\" she said. \"That focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album and keeping the bar really high is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time.",
      "\"I tend to love to write lots and lots of music, so it's a temptation to release lots of music. I wanted to do an album that was so focused on quality and on the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle.\"",
      "Melodies and lyrics were key goals",
      "Swift opened up about the primary objectives she had making \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",
      "\"My main goals were melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it and lyrics that are just as vivid but crisp and focused and completely intentional,\" she said.",
      "Martin had made a point to tell Swift he didn't want her to leave behind the type of writing and storytelling she did on \"folklore\" (released in July 2020) even if the sound of this album was different. Swift said she replied, \"I couldn't if I tried.\"",
      "\"So it was really amazing that we were able to, without doing too much overthinking, we were able to get in there and it was just ideas flying and all of these ideas were like, we've been waiting years to come back together and make this project.\"",
      "The album art",
      "The cover of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" is a layered picture of Swift submerged in water.",
      "\"This represents the end of my night,\" she explained. \"When I'm on tour, I have the same day every single day \u2026 and my day ends with me in a bathtub.\"",
      "Swift wanted the cover to show something offstage to represent the theme of the album.",
      "\"This album isn't really about what happened to me on stage, it's about what I was going through offstage,\" she said. \"It's the life beyond the show.\"",
      "The images were captured by photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, who Swift previously worked with for the album art for her sixth studio album, \"reputation,\" released in 2017.",
      "\"I loved what they did with those photos, so I called them up for this one, and I'm so happy with the way that the photos came out for this one,\" she said.",
      "The album was recorded in Sweden during the Eras Tour",
      "Swift traveled to Sweden on her off days while touring Europe during the Eras Tour to work on the album.",
      "\"I would be playing shows, I'd do like three shows in a row. I'd have like three days off, I'd fly to Sweden,\" she said. \"I was physically exhausted at this point in the tour but I was so mentally stimulated and so excited to be creating.\"",
      "\"This album is going to make you dance\"",
      "Some additional details about \"The Life of a Showgirl\" came from Travis Kelce, who revealed he has heard the whole album.",
      "\"I know they're all 12 bangers,\" he said. \"It's a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more like fun pop like excitement. \u2026 I think it's a complete 180 from a lot of the songs on 'Tortured Poets' for sure.\"",
      "Swift confirmed that was a good way to describe the album, adding, \"Life is more upbeat.\"",
      "Travis later told Jason, \"you are going to move.\"",

      "\"A couple months after the Super Bowl in Kansas City, I get a call from my mom,\" Swift said. \"She's like, 'You got your music.' I very dramatically hit the floor for real. Bawling my eyes out, weeping, like 'Really!?' I said to myself, 'Go tell Travis in a normal way,' he was playing video games, and he put his headset down. I was like, 'I got my music back!'

      "\"I have parameters. There's do's and dont's,\" Swift said. \"It points to my music... It's something you don't know why I'm saying for a specific reason, but then you'll look back and go, 'Oh my God.'\"",

After the White House accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year, Mr. Trump ousted Kennedy Center board members appointed by former President Joe Biden, replacing them with his allies. Soon afterward, the new board replaced the center's chairman, David Rubenstein, with Mr. Trump, and Richard Grenell became the Kennedy Center's interim president.",

      "Toronto \u2014 Air Canada said Tuesday it will restart operations gradually after a tentative agreement was reached with the union for 10,000 flight attendants to end a strike that disrupted the travel plans of hundreds of thousands of passengers.",
      "The Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, made the announcement\u00a0on its Facebook page\u00a0early Tuesday.",
      "It came after the union and Air Canada resumed talks late Monday for the first time since the strike began over the weekend. The walkout affected about 130,000 travelers a day at the peak of the summer travel season.",
      "Canada's largest airline said flights will start resuming Tuesday evening.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday after turning down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "The union said the agreement will guarantee members pay for work performed while planes are on the ground, resolving one of the major issues that drove the strike.",
      "\"Unpaid work is over. We have reclaimed our voice and our power,\" the union said in a statement. \"When our rights were taken away, we stood strong, we fought back - and we secured a tentative agreement that our members can vote on.\"",
      "Air Canada Chief Executive Michael Rousseau said restarting a major carrier is a complex undertaking and said regular service may require seven to 10 days. Some flights will be canceled until the schedule is stabilized.",
      "\"Full restoration may require a week or more, so we ask for our customers' patience and understanding over the coming days,\" Rousseau said in a statement.",
      "The two sides reached the deal with the help of a mediator early Tuesday morning. The airline said mediation discussions \"were begun on the basis that the union commit to have the airline's 10,000 flight attendants immediately return to work.\" Air Canada declined to comment further on the agreement until the ratification process is complete. It noted a strike or lockout is not possible during this time.",
      "The union said it is \"required to advise our membership that we must fully cooperate with resumption of operations,\" adding that the talks that settled the strike began at 7 p.m. Monday lasted until 4:23 a.m. Tuesday",
      "Earlier, Air Canada said rolling cancellations would extend through Tuesday afternoon after the union defied a second return-to-work order.",
      "The Canada Industrial Relations Board had declared the strike illegal Monday and ordered the flight attendants back on the job. But the union said it would defy the directive. Union leaders also ignored a weekend order to submit to binding arbitration and end the strike by Sunday afternoon.",
      "The board is an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada's labor laws. The government ordered the board to intervene.",

      "Over half of U.S. households that earn less than $50,000 a year say they plan to buy only essential school items, while 74% say they are shopping earlier than usual to avoid a potential hit from tariffs,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization that opposes higher import duties.",
      "Many back-to-school essentials, from clothing and footwear to personal electronics, are imported. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0estimates that the U.S. tariff rate on such goods has jumped to an average of 18% this year, more than triple the 5% rate in 2024.",
      "Families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade are projected to spend an average of $858 on clothing, shoes, school supplies and electronics this year, NRF found. That's down slightly from $875 in 2024, as inflation has continued to ease this year, although up sharply from $697 in 2019, the group's data shows.",
      "Record high prices",
      "Recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0shows\u00a0that the cost of school supplies and books is at a record high. A recent analysis from The Century Foundation also found that prices for a typical assortment of school supplies are up more than 7% in price this year, with goods such index cards and binders subject to even steeper price hikes.",
      "School supplies cut across a range of goods categories, from dorm room d\u00e9cor, clothing and personal electronics to staples including writing implements, notebooks and backpacks.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "Although steep new U.S. tariffs haven't delivered the kind of shock to the economy that some forecasters expected, many consumers are worried, shopping expert Trae Bodge told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"All of the studies that I'm seeing are showing that consumers are concerned,\" Bodge said. \"We are seeing prices ticking up because of tariffs, because of inflation. And so people are worried about being able to afford the things they need for school.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge \u2014 rose 2.7% in July on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "How to save",
      "Large retailers are rolling out deep discounts on some school supplies, with items like notebooks, folders, crayons and erasers selling for less than $1.",
      "For big-ticket items, experts urge consumers to compare prices. That includes cross-checking in-store prices against online deals. For example, a $269 Samsung Galaxy tablet at one retailer was available for $220 on its app. Most retailers also will match the best price on their own websites, Bodge noted.",
      "When it comes to personal electronics, many of which are imported and now subject to President Trump's wide-reaching tariffs, Bodge urges consumers to consider buying refurbished models.",
      "\"A lot of retailers offer refurbished items that also come with a warranty, and that's a really good option if you're looking to save,\" she said.",
      "When it comes to products like pencils and notebooks, buying a store-brand over a name-brand also often offers savings. For clothes, experts advise waiting until school starts \u2014 when kids ask for whatever is trendy, you'll have a little money left over.",
      "Another way to both manage your budget while imparting a lesson on spending is to give teens a gift card, Bodge said. \"So they will be much more careful spending their money versus your money. And they'll stay on budget by doing this,\" she told CBS News.",

      "Wages still haven't caught up with inflation, four years after the pandemic caused prices to soar and created a cost-of-living crisis for many households, a new study finds.",
      "Americans on average are earning 1.2 percentage points below the rise in the cost of living over the past four years, which means that the typical worker's pay increases over that time haven't yet caught up to higher prices, according to Bankrate's 2025 Wage to Inflation Index.",
      "The findings come as Americans remain sour about the economy, with 55% rating it as either very or fairly bad, according to a July poll from CBS News. Three-quarters said their incomes haven't kept up with inflation, while a majority also said they've seen prices creep higher in recent weeks and also expect that to continue.",
      "But some professions are falling further behind than others, with educators seeing the biggest gap between income growth and inflation during the past four years, the study found. Teachers have long struggled with a \"wage gap,\" meaning that they typically earn less than college graduates working in other fields, due to issues such as constraints on school funding,\u00a0according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"Wage growth is often a reflection of who has the power in the labor market,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If there are more job openings than workers to fill them, businesses will often lift pay to retain or attract talent.\"",
      "She added, \"On the flip side, if there are too few job openings, companies don't have to work as hard to keep workers because they have nowhere to really go.\"",
      "Overall, the 1.2 percentage point gap between the typical workers' pay growth and inflation during the past four years signals that many households are continuing to feel financial strain, Foster added. Even before the pandemic, millions of Americans were\u00a0struggling to save for emergencies.",
      "\"Wages not keeping up with inflation translate to outright purchasing-power destruction,\" Foster said. \"These are funds that households could be using to stash away for their goals, like saving for retirement and a home, or building up their safety nets and emergency fund.\"",
      "The professions that have outpaced inflation include those that saw a spike in demand after the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality workers, she added. \"Health care, meanwhile, is driving job growth lately, accounting for 88% of private-sector payroll growth last month,\" Foster said.",
      "Wage dissatisfaction",
      "Only about 54% of Americans say they are satisfied with their current wages, according to a new analysis from Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That represents the lowest satisfaction level since the NY Fed began tracking the measure in 2014.",
      "Even high-income households, which contribute about\u00a0half of all consumer spending\u00a0and drive economic growth, are facing bigger financial hurdles, including surging delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans, according to recent research.",
      "For instance, the share of all new jobs that pay above-average wages has fallen to 7% this year, down from 38% prior to 2020, according to credit-scoring company VantageScore. That can make it tougher for professionals to find new jobs if they suffer a job loss, the group noted.",
      "Workers in white-collar industries like finance and business services \"speak of a frozen job market,\" Foster noted. \"Employed workers in the sector can't find anywhere else to go and unemployed workers struggle to find new work.\"",

    "story": [
      "Labubu dolls are so popular that they've inspired knockoffs \u2014 dubbed Lafufus, for fake Labubus \u2014 that can endanger kids, according to federal regulators",
      "The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on Monday issued an \"urgent safety warning\" that said the phony Labubus \"pose a serious risk of choking and death to young children.\" The fakes, which are sold both as dolls and as small keychains, can fit in a small child's mouth and block their airway, the agency said.",
      "Additionally, some of the knockoffs are so poorly made that they can break into small pieces that children could insert in their mouths. The CPSC warned consumers not to buy the fakes and to immediately stop using any of faux dolls they may own.",
      "\"These fake Labubu dolls are dangerous, illegal and have no place in American homes,\" CPSC Acting Chairman Peter Feldman said in a statement. \"No parent should have to wonder if a toy will stop their child from breathing. Protect your children and buy only from reputable sellers.\"",
      "Labubus, which are inspired by characters from Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung's book \"The Monsters Trilogy,\" retail for under $30 through Chinese seller Pop Mart. Some rare variants can fetch thousands through online marketplaces.",
      "How to spot a fake \"Lafufu\"",
      "Deeply discounted Labubu dolls can indicate that the products are inauthentic, according to the CPSC. Look for a holographic Pop Mart sticker and scannable QR code to identify real Labubu. Newer authentic Labubus also bear what the CPSC describes as a discrete UV stamp on one foot.",
      "A doll's teeth can also betray a fake \u2014 authentic Labubus have nine, while imitations sometimes have a different number. And fakes can be brighter than the real dolls, according to the CPSC.",

      "Following a ruling from a federal judge, the settlement administration for AT&T\u00a0said on Aug. 4 that a proposed settlement has been reached for $177 million, with $149 million earmarked for the first settlement class and $28 million set aside for the second settlement class.",
      "The settlement, however, still has to be approved. According to the settlement website, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas will hold a final approval hearing on Dec. 3, 2025. In the meantime, impacted AT&T customers can file for compensation.",

      "How do I file a claim?",
      "To receive part of the settlement, impacted AT&T customers have to fill out this claim form\u00a0online by Nov. 18, 2025.

      "As stated on the settlement website, if you file a claim, you give up your right to sue AT&T.",
      "How much will I get?",
      "People whose data was exposed in the breach announced in March 2024 are eligible for up to $5,000 and can make claims for \"payment for losses that occurred in 2019, or later,\" according to the settlement website.",
      "Those who were part of the second breach announced in July of last year are eligible for up to $2,500 \"for losses that occurred on or after April 14, 2024,\" the settlement administration said.",
      "In both cases, customers must provide documentation showing that the losses they incurred are \"fairly traceable\" to the AT&T data breaches. Proof can include receipts and other documents \"not self-prepared by the claimant that documents the costs incurred,\" according to the settlement website.",
      "If your information was part of both breaches, you could be eligible for up to $7,500. That would make you part what the settlement administration calls a \"overlap settlement class member.\"",
      "When could I get a payment?",
      "Not until December, at the earliest. If the court approves the settlement at the Dec. 3 hearing, there could be appeals after that, which would take time to resolve.",

    "summary": "Miners want to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
    "story": [
      "A gold rush brought settlers to South Dakota's Black Hills roughly 150 years ago, chasing the dream of wealth and displacing Native Americans in the process.",
      "Now, a new crop of miners driven by gold prices at more than $3,000 an ounce are seeking to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
      "\"These impacts can be long term and make it so that tourism and outdoor recreation is negatively impacted,\" said Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance. \"Our enjoyment of the Black Hills as a peaceful place, a sacred place, is disturbed.\"",
      "The Black Hills encompass over 1.2 million acres, rising up from the Great Plains in southwest South Dakota and extending into Wyoming. The jagged peaks are smaller than those of the Rocky Mountains, but the lush pine-covered hills are sacred to the Lakota Sioux people and serve as a destination for millions of tourists who visit Mount Rushmore and state parks.",
      "Dramatic landscape changes come with modern mining",
      "One gold mine now operates in the Black Hills, but companies have proposals before state and federal agencies for another one, plus exploratory drilling sites that they hope will lead to full-fledged mines. That has prompted opposition by Native American tribes and environmentalists who argue the projects are close to sacred sites, will contaminate waterways and permanently scar the landscape.",
      "Gold extraction has changed dramatically in the decades since prospectors first began panning for gold in the Black Hills. The industry now typically relies on massive trucks and diggers that create deep, multitiered pits and use chemicals like cyanide to extract the gold.",
      "The land can never return to its original state. The Homestake mine, once the largest and deepest gold mine in the Western Hemisphere, now sits barren in Lead, South Dakota, and is used for scientific research.",
      "Interest in Black Hills gold mining has soared along with the price of the metal. When the Homestake mine closed in 2002, gold sold for about $300 an ounce. Now it goes for about 10 times as much.",
      "Joseph Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, attributes the price spike to global economic uncertainty.",
      "\"Gold tends to be a stable asset,\" he said. \"That actually performs well in inflationary times, and holds its value in recessionary times. That's why gold as an asset in investment.\"",
      "President Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews.",
      "Colin Paterson, professor emeritus of geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, notes that Black Hills gold is encased in rock. To extract it, the rock is crushed and then a chemical like cyanide is used to dissolve the mineral and remove it.",
      "Mining brings revenue, but renews Black Hills fight",
      "Coeur Mining runs the single active mine in the Black Hills, but the company Dakota Gold has plans for an open pit mine to begin operating in 2029. The company is also targeting the area near the old Homestake site to build an underground mine where workers would descend hundreds or even thousands of feet into shafts.",
      "According to data provided by Dakota Gold, they believe the net present value for the deposits could range from $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion, CBS affiliate KELO-TV reported last month.",
      "Jack Henris, president and chief operating officer of Dakota Gold, estimated the open pit mine would create up to 250 jobs and result in the company paying the state up to $400 million in taxes over the life of the mine. Dakota Gold will conduct an environmental study and surveys of soil and vegetation to ensure safe operation, Henris said.",
      "\"Most of the people that work here are from this area and just love to live here,\" he said. \"So we're a big part of the Hills and we love them just as much as other folks.\"",
      "To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region.",
      "The U.S. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the Sioux were entitled to compensation, but they have not accepted any and maintain their claim to the land.",
      "Tribes have largely opposed mining in the Black Hills.",
      "\"There's a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,\" said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. \"It's not even the actual mineral content of the Black Hills that is so attractive to mining companies. It's the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.\"",
      "Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold's mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Forest Service regulations required for projects on public acreage.",
      "Environmentalists have focused their opposition on the possibility of chemicals leaks. They note that Coeur's Wharf mine has had nearly 200 spills and that the former Homestake mine was closed because it contaminated a nearby creek.",
      "Coeur's environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was \"thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.\" The company is always improving its processes, she added.",
      "Lakota People's Law Project\u00a0and the\u00a0Black Hills Clean Water Alliance have also voiced opposition to the proposed drilling and mining for gold in the area, KELO-TV reported.",
      "Jarding, of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said she remains concerned about the number of projects in the works.",
      "\"It's really important that people understand the exponential growth in mining activity that's been happening in the Black Hills over the last five years or so,\" Jarding said. \"There are currently active mining claims on 271,000 acres in the Black Hills. That's 20% of the whole Black Hills that is potentially going to be subject to mining.\"",

      "\"The Liberals have talked out of both sides of their mouths. They said the best place for this is at the bargaining table. They refused to correct this historic injustice through legislation,\" said Wesley Lesosky, President of the Air Canada Component of the Canadian Union of Public Employees.",
      "\"Now, when we're at the bargaining table with an obstinate employer, the Liberals are violating our Charter rights to take job action and give Air Canada exactly what they want \u2014 hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation,\" Lesosky said in a statement.",
      "A bitter contract fight between Canada's largest airline and the union representing 10,000 of its flight attendants escalated Friday as the union turned down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which would eliminate its right to strike and allow a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. EDT on Saturday. Around the same time, Air Canada said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports.",
      "Hugh Pouliot, the spokesman for the union, earlier said the union had a meeting with Hajdu and representatives from Air Canada earlier Friday evening.",
      "\"CUPE has engaged with the mediator to relay our willingness to continue bargaining \u2014 despite the fact that Air Canada has not countered our last two offers since Tuesday,\" he said in an email. \"We're here to bargain a deal, not to go on strike.\"",
      "A complete shutdown will affect approximately 130,000 people daily, and around 25,000 Canadians will be stranded abroad each day. Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.",
      "Keelin Pringnitz, from Ottawa, was returning with her family from a European vacation when they became stranded at London's Heathrow Airport after flights were cancelled. She said there was an option for the travelers in line to go the United States, but was told there wouldn't be any further assistance once they landed in the U.S.",
      "\"It didn't go over well with the line. Nobody really seemed interested, everybody seemed a little bit amused almost at the suggestion, or exasperated, because it is a bit ridiculous to offer to take stranded passengers to a different country to strand them there,\" she said.",
      "Montreal resident Alex Laroche, 21, and his girlfriend had been saving for their European vacation since Christmas. Now their $8,000 trip with nonrefundable lodging is on the line as they wait to hear from Air Canada about the fate of their Saturday night flight to Nice, France.",
      "Laroche said he considered booking new flights with a different carrier, but he said most of them are nearly full and cost more than double the $3,000 they paid for their original tickets.",
      "\"At this point, it's just a waiting game,\" he said.",
      "Laroche said he was initially upset over the union's decision to go on strike, but that he had a change of heart after reading about the key issues at the center of the contract negotiations, including the issue of wages.",
      "\"Their wage is barely livable,\" Laroche said.",
      "The airline said it would also offer alternative travel options through other Canadian and foreign airlines when possible. But it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full \"due to the summer travel peak.\"",
      "\"Air Canada is strongly advising affected customers not to go to the airport unless they have a confirmed ticket on an airline other than Air Canada or Air Canada Rouge,\" the airline said in a statement. \"Air Canada deeply regrets the effect the strike is having on customers.\"",
      "Canada is the second-largest country in the world and flying is often the only viable way to travel around the nation. The government forced the country's two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union last year during a work stoppage. The union for the rail workers is suing, arguing the government is removing a union's leverage in negotiations.",
      "The Business Council of Canada has urged the government to impose binding arbitration in this case, too.",
      "In anticipation of the strike, the airline began cancelling flights on Thursday and Friday as flight attendants did not report to work.",
      "How long the airline's planes will be grounded remains to be seen, but Air Canada Chief Operating Officer Mark Nasr has said it could take up to a week to restart operations once a tentative deal is reached fully.",
      "Passengers whose travel is impacted will be eligible to request a full refund on the airline's website or mobile app, according to Air Canada.",
      "Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal.",
      "Both sides say they remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work flight attendants do when planes aren't in the air.",
      "The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions over four years, that it said \"would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.\"",
      "But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.",

    "story": [
      "Old shipping containers are plentiful in the U.S., and architect Brian Stark knows exactly what to do with them.",
      "He began by designing buildings out of old shipping containers, which are scattered across the streetscape of Phoenix. His projects are as much about cost-saving as they are about being environmentally friendly, with the long-term goal of helping tackle America's affordable housing crisis.",
      "\"We're not consuming or producing that steel, it already exists,\" Stark said. \"There's a huge ability to save. And that's how I think we have to start thinking that way, is using what we have versus just keep on consuming.\"",
      "How the design process works",
      "Stark took his concept a step further and began designing homes for Phoenix's unhoused people out of the steel containers. The project was developed for the City of Phoenix with sustainable living company Steel + Spark, and the housing units are called \"X-WING\" shelters as an ode to the unit's \"X\" design.",
      "Each \"X-WING\" is made up of four containers, topped with solar panels and joined together in an \"X\" shape that also creates courtyards for its residents when placed beside another unit. Each container has five rooms, with one resident per room. The units are fully air-conditioned, which is crucial for a city that reaches record temperatures every year.",
      "Most importantly, the shelters only take a week to construct.",
      "Jay Spicer, who lives in one of the \"X-WING\" rooms with his dog, Dino, qualified for the unit by staying sober for eight months and holding a job as a forklift operator.",
      "Though it's a small space, it's his own.",
      "\"It is my space for now,\" Spicer says, \"we keep the door shut, it stays nice and cool in here.\"",

      "In Arizona, approximately 14,737 people experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, up 3% from 2023, according to the Homelessness in Arizona Annual Report published by the Arizona Department of Economic Security.",
      "Plans for shipping containers",
      "Stark doesn't plan on stopping with the \"X-WING\" shelters, either. His next big plan is to tackle the country's affordable housing crisis by building a 105-unit apartment complex out of shipping containers, specifically for low-income or unhoused senior citizens.",
      "Despite challenges with selling his ideas to certain developers, Stark can tell he's making a huge difference for people.",
      "\"It's great talking to people who are living in the X-WING that say, 'I can hear myself think for the first time, and I'm improving my life,'\" Stark says, \"to be part of the solution is great, it's unbelievable.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 09:39:06 -0400",
    "summary": "As less young people meet major economic milestones such as moving out and getting married, the concept of adulthood is changing.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer young adults are achieving economic and family milestones typically associated with adulthood, according to a recent working\u00a0paper\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

      "Taylor Swift's upcoming album release and her love of all things orange isn't lost on her fans \u2014 or brands that are seeking a ride on what has become an enormous economic tailwind.",
      "On Wednesday after Swift went on the \"New Heights\" podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, NFL football star Travis Kelce, to announce the imminent release of her 12th studio album \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" major companies went into marketing overdrive.",
      "Numerous corporations, from United Airlines to Olive Garden, began posting orange-hued memes on their own social media accounts soon after the new album was announced. Shake Shack, FedEx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cinnabon, Walmart and Netflix did, too.",
      "That's because Swift appeared onstage wearing orange numerous times toward the end of her Eras Tour, and discussed her feelings about the color on the Wednesday podcast.",
      "\"It feels like energetically how my life has felt,\" the 14-time Grammy winner tells co-host Jason Kelce.",

      "mb12 pic.twitter.com/HUz2MYpEMc",
      "Even X got in on the action, declaring that it had a new profile pic: a\u00a0glittery orange X. The post soon garnered 5.5 million views.",

      "Swift's tour appearances have become economic events. The singer's Eras Tour two years ago was the first such tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts. Cities and their surrounding areas registered a sizeable economic boost after Swift appeared, with thousands of fans making the pilgrimage and spending money at hotels, restaurants and elsewhere.",
      "Swift also mentioned during the Wednesday podcast that she had Lasik eye surgery. In response, the X account for LASIK.com wasted no time promoting the fortuitous namedrop. The post had more than 450,000 views and 17,000 likes as of Friday.",
      "About 500,000 Americans undergo Lasik every year, CBS News recently reported. And while the American Refractive Surgery Council says the complication rate is less than 1%, side effects are not uncommon and should not be taken lightly by those considering the procedure.",
      "Swift's two-hour chat with the Kelce brothers marks the singer's first ever podcast interview, a milestone moment for the medium.",
      "By Thursday afternoon, Wednesday night's talk had already been seen more than 11.7 million times on YouTube. Clips distributed on Instagram, TikTok, X and elsewhere have received more than 400 million views, and the episode was also available for streaming on audio platforms.",
      "It has further to go to be a record-setter, though. The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is by a company called Thmanyah, a Saudi Arabian Arabic podcast network and independent journalism platform, according to its website. The video has racked up 144 million views in two years.",
      "Swift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work \u2014 a yearslong quest.",

      "That's according to a new report from Deloitte that shows the overall cost of homemade lunches is on the rise. The average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, according to Deloitte, up nearly 3% from $5.99 last year. Just under half of the parents polled by the survey said they expect their child's lunch to cost more this September than it did in 2024.",
      "The reason for the price increase, as the Deloitte report points out, is because the cost of groceries has climbed in recent years. Parents are now paying more for staples like whole milk, which is up 7.8% from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data for July, as well as for bananas, which are up 7.2%.",

      "In response to their anticipation of higher lunch prices, caregivers plan to switch from name brands to store brands, choose cheaper sandwich options, and cut down in other household expenses to free up more cash for groceries, according to Deloitte's survey, which polled 1,203 caregivers of school-aged children.",
      "Frugal food shopping in the U.S. has \"generally been on an upward trend since October 2024,\" the report found, though it is still lower today than its peak in 2023.",
      "Cafeteria lunch crunch",
      "It's not just brown bag lunches that could end up costing families more. Cafeteria lunches, which tend to be cheaper than brown bag lunches, could also see a price hike this year.",
      "According to Tuesday's CPI data, the price of food at elementary and secondary schools is up 3.3% since July of last year. To account for inflation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would funnel more money into the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs \u2014 which provide healthy, low-cost or free meals to children.",
      "To be sure, not everyone will end up paying full price for cafeteria school lunches. In Deloitte's survey, more than half of respondents said their school offers free lunch, regardless of income.",

The personal finance site found that the price of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal from McDonald's more than doubled in price from $5.39 in 2014 to $11.99 in 2024.",
      "To be sure, reports of slowing traffic at fast-food chains have preceded the recent decline in breakfast sales. On an earnings call in May 2024, McDonald's CEO Kempczinski expressed \"heightened anxiety\" about how the economy was weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans. During that same time, the CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP,\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that casual restaurants were also seeing a drop in low-income customers.",
      "Still, not all fast-food chains are experiencing declines in breakfast traffic. Both Starbucks and Dunkin' told CBS MoneyWatch they've seen success with breakfast sales.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, both McDonald's and Wendy's pointed to their earnings reports.",
      "What falling breakfast sales say about the economy",
      "Experts say that American consumers' decision to skip out on breakfast points to myriad economic pressures facing low- and middle-income consumers ranging from sky-high credit card interest rates to inflation.",
      "\"The fact that the breakfast day part is slowing now, in our opinion, speaks to heightened economic uncertainty and the lower consumer confidence that we've seen, and that really escalated as tariff rhetoric came into the picture,\" Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The consumer is very value focused, discerning and selective about how they're spending. I think we would say we think breakfast is the easiest meal to cut because consumers can eat something quickly,\" Todd said.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch that low- and middle-income Americans have been spending more cautiously since the end of last year, in part due to a \"weakening\" labor market. \"That's adding to their nervousness and their caution so far this year,\" he said.",
      "The most recent jobs report showed hiring slowed in July. The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June.",
      "Experts also told CBS MoneyWatch that low-income consumers' purchasing power is already under pressure due to inflation \u2014 something they said\u00a0tariffs could exacerbate. The Consumer Price Index in July showed inflation held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis. Restaurant prices are up 3.9% since July of last year and 0.3% from June.",
      "\"If they have to spend more to buy a pair of shoes or get their hair cut, they're gonna have less to spend on everything else again, including breakfast at a fast-food restaurant,\" Zandi said.",

      "Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) next year, which is slightly more than the 2.5% boost U.S. retirees\u00a0received\u00a0this year.",
      "The new estimate comes from the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group, which posted its prediction on its website on Tuesday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its latest\u00a0inflation figures.",
      "AARP also\u00a0released\u00a02026 COLA estimates from experts, such as Mike Lynch, managing director of applied insights at Hartford Funds, who predicted a more modest adjustment in line with the 2025 COLA.",
      "The Social Security Administration makes a cost-of-living adjustment each year to ensure benefits payments for U.S. seniors keep pace with inflation. The yearly adjustment, which the agency is scheduled to announce in October, would go into effect in January 2026.",
      "The SSA did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Each fall, the agency uses inflation data from July, August and September to determine the COLA for the next year. The consumer price index (CPI), a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in prices on everyday items over time, showed that the inflation rate in July held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis, the same as it was in June.",
      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices. Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch that he estimates headline CPI will rise to 3.7% and core CPI will rise to 3.8% by the second quarter of 2026.",
      "Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at New York City's New School, believes inflation will likely rise and is concerned that a moderate cost-of-living adjustment \"probably won't be enough to cover the inflation rates that we're headed into,\" AARP reported.",
      "Martha Shedden, the president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, echoed that concern, telling CBS MoneyWatch that based on the current way COLA is calculated, the increase\u00a0is \"not keeping up with seniors' true expenses.\"",
      "According the the AARP, the 2.5% COLA adjustment introduced this year boosted the average Social Security retiree's payment by about $49 a month. The average monthly Social Security check for all beneficiaries was $1,861 in June 2025 and $2,005 for retired workers,\u00a0according to the Senior Citizens League.",
      "In addition to the COLA, some senior citizens will also benefit from a provision included in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" which provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for Americans aged 65 and older.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump promised Monday to work to end mail-in voting and said work is already underway on an executive order to ban it before the 2026 midterm elections, although the Constitution does not give him this power.",
      "\"We, as a Republican Party, are going to do everything possible that we get rid of mail-in ballots,\" he said during an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots.\"",
      "Why does Trump want to ban mail-in ballots?",
      "\"Mail-in ballots are corrupt,\" the president said. He suggested the method is susceptible to voter fraud, claiming in California, \"it's so corrupt, where some people get five, six, seven ballots delivered to them.\" He has often insisted mail-in ballots can be tampered with or enable people to vote multiple times.",
      "But soon after the 2020 election, Debra Cleaver, founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan voter information site, dismissed the idea of widespread voter fraud as \"a myth.\"",
      "\"The outgoing ballots have a barcode, and then when you send your ballot in, you put it in a return envelope and that barcode has to match the barcode that was sent out in order for the ballot to be counted,\" she explained to CBS News.",
      "After that election, the director of the nation's cyber security agency, Christopher Krebs, called the 2020 vote \"the most secure in American history.\"",
      "In 2024, when Mr. Trump won the presidential election, the U.S. Census Bureau said nearly a third of ballots nationwide were cast by mail.",
      "The White House told CBS News in a statement that Democrats had \"eroded faith in our elections\" with policies like \"unfettered mail-in voting.\"",
      "\"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Monday night.",

      "In a social media post earlier in the day, the president said of the impending order that it would \"help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "He claimed that the states \"are merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,\" and that \"[t]hey must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.\"",
      "But Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution says it's the states that have the authority to regulate elections, not the president, and this may be changed only by Congress.",

      "Mr. Trump also claimed, \"We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting\" and argued, \"You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in. And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected.\"",
      "In fact, more than 30 other countries allow voting by mail for some or all voters, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an intergovernmental advocacy group based in Sweden. Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany\u00a0and Denmark are among them.",
      "Mail-in voting in the U.S.",
      "In the U.S., mail voting is widespread: 28 states allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot, while the rest require a a documented reason such as illness or military service.",
      "The pandemic gave mail voting a huge boost in the 2020 elections. About 43% of voters cast their ballot by mail that year, according to a report by the Election Assistance Commission. In 2024, mail voting dropped off, representing just over 30% of the total votes cast \u2014 about 46.8 million votes. The commission said that last year's numbers still exceeded pre-pandemic levels.",
      "The topic of mail-in voting came up during Mr. Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, too. After the two met Friday, the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said, 'You can't have an honest election, election with mail-in voting.' And he said, 'There's not a country in the world that uses it now.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two talked about the 2020 election and that Putin told him, \"You won that election by so much, and that's (mail voting) how [Biden] got it.\" Audits and investigations, including some conducted by Trump supporters and Republican secretaries of state, showed no evidence that the 2020 election results were inaccurate.",
      "David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, pointed out in a statement to CBS News that mail-in voting has been around since the Civil War and said getting rid of mail voting \"is an incredibly bad idea that would make our elections much less secure and vulnerable to interference.\"",
      "\"Requiring states to eliminate or replace the voting machines that confirmed the election of this president, just 15 months before a midterm election and less than a year before primaries, is not possible and would result in chaos,\" said Becker, who is also a CBS News election law contributor.",

      "Jonathan Zimmerman, who teaches history of education at the University of Pennsylvania, said Oklahoma's contract with PragerU to test out-of-state would-be teachers \"is a watershed moment.\"",
      "\"Instead of Prager simply being a resource that you can draw in an optional way, Prager has become institutionalized as part of the state system,\" he said. \"There's no other way to describe it.\"",
      "Zimmerman said the American Historical Association did a survey last year of 7th- to 12th-grade teachers and found that only a minority were relying on textbooks for day-to-day instruction.

      "The Democratic quorum break was triggered by a Republican push to redraw the state's U.S. House district maps that would net the GOP up to five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Last week, the absent lawmakers had signaled they were ready to return to Austin after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ended a first special session and Democrats in California moved forward with a plan to respond.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:08:02 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge tossed out part of a lawsuit brought by detainees at the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center in the Florida Everglades, handing a partial victory to the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday tossed out part of a lawsuit brought by detainees at a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, handing a partial victory to the Trump administration and Florida state officials \u2014 though other challenges over \"Alligator Alcatraz\" are still pending.",
      "Civil rights attorneys had sued the Trump administration and the state of Florida, seeking a preliminary injunction to ensure that detainees at the facility have confidential access to lawyers. It's the second lawsuit challenging practices at Alligator Alcatraz, a controversial detention facility that the Trump administration has cast as a symbol of its crackdown on illegal immigration \u2014 along with a suit arguing the facility had skirted environmental rules.",
      "But after a hearing on Monday, Miami-based U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz dismissed one part of their suit that alleged the government was violating the Fifth Amendment because it hadn't made clear for weeks which immigration court had jurisdiction over Alligator Alcatraz, preventing detainees from filing court petitions. Ruiz ruled that this claim is now moot because the government has since said publicly that the court at the Krome Detention Center in South Florida will hear the detainees' claims.",
      "\"The Court can do no more,\" Ruiz wrote.",
      "The judge did not dismiss several other claims that the government is violating the First Amendment by allegedly making it difficult for detainees to talk to their lawyers, especially in confidential settings. Ruiz said that continues to be a \"live controversy.\" But he ordered the case to be transferred to a different federal court, because Alligator Alcatraz is technically within the boundaries of the Orlando-based Middle District of Florida.",
      "The federal government has denied that defendants are blocked from meeting with attorneys.",
      "Alligator Alcatraz jurisdiction clarifications",
      "The civil rights attorneys wanted Ruiz to identify an immigration court that has jurisdiction over the detention center so that petitions can be filed for the detainees' bond or release. The attorneys say that hearings for their cases have been routinely canceled in federal Florida immigration courts by judges who say they don't have jurisdiction over the detainees held in the Everglades.",
      "At the start of Monday's hearing, government attorneys said they would designate the immigration court at the Krome North Service Processing Center in the Miami area as having jurisdiction over the detention center in the Everglades in an effort to address some of the civil rights attorneys' constitutional concerns. The judge told the government attorneys that he didn't expect them to change that designation without good reason.",
      "But before delving into the core issues of the detainees' rights, Ruiz wanted to hear about whether the lawsuit was filed in the proper jurisdiction in Miami. The state and federal government defendants have argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility was built is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district.",
      "The hearing ended without the judge making an immediate ruling. Ruiz suggested that the case against the federal defendants might be appropriate for the southern district because a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Miami is responsible for oversight of the detention center under an agreement between the state and federal governments.",
      "But Ruiz also questioned whether the case against the state defendants might be better in the middle district, because all of the purported civil rights violations occurred at the facility itself, which is located in Collier County, several miles outside the southern district.",
      "All parties have agreed that if the complaints against the state are moved to another venue, then the complaints against the federal government should be moved as well.",
      "Second lawsuit seeks halt of operations at Alligator Alcatraz",
      "The hearing over legal access comes as another federal judge in Miami considers whether construction and operations at the facility should be halted indefinitely because federal environmental rules weren't followed.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams on Aug. 7 ordered a 14-day halt on additional construction at the site while witnesses testified at a hearing that wrapped up last week. She has said she plans to issue a ruling before the order expires later this week.",
      "State says claims in lawsuit are false",
      "The state of Florida has disputed claims that Alligator Alcatraz detainees have been unable to meet with their attorneys. The state's lawyers said that since July 15, when videoconferencing started at the facility, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, and in-person meetings started July 28. The first detainees arrived at the beginning of July.",
      "But the civil rights attorneys said that even if lawyers have been scheduled to meet with their clients at the detention center, it hasn't been in private or confidential, and it is more restrictive than at other immigration detention facilities. They said scheduling delays and an unreasonable advanced notice requirement have hindered their ability to meet with the detainees, thereby violating their constitutional rights.",
      "Civil rights attorneys said officers are going cell-to-cell to pressure detainees into signing voluntary removal orders before they're allowed to consult their attorneys, and some detainees have been deported even though they didn't have final removal orders. Along with the spread of a respiratory infection and rainwater flooding their tents, the circumstances have fueled a feeling of desperation among detainees, the attorneys wrote in a court filing.",

      "FOX News Digital was first to report Bailey's appointment.",
      "In the past, the FBI deputy director has typically been a career staffer at the bureau. Neither of the Trump administration's deputy leaders had a history with the FBI prior to their appointments: Bailey served in the Army and worked as a state prosecutor in Missouri for much of his career, and Bongino was a Secret Service agent before working as a media personality.",
      "Bailey has served as Missouri's attorney general since 2023. He's known for asking the Supreme Court to intervene on Missouri's behalf in a criminal case against Mr. Trump brought by New York prosecutors \u2014 a longshot request that was rejected by the high court. He's also defended his state's restrictions on abortion and gender-affirming care for minors, and sued Starbucks over its diversity, equity and inclusion policies.",
      "A Trump loyalist, Bongino clashed with some other administration officials last month amid controversy over the FBI and Justice Department's handling of a review of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The deputy FBI director didn't show up to work at the department at one point, and weighed resigning from his role, sources told CBS News at the time.",

      "The lawsuit focuses on the Office for Victims of Crime, a 42-year-old division of the Justice Department that hands out more than $1 billion per year to all 50 states to compensate crime victims and fund programs like local crisis counseling centers, emergency shelters, domestic abuse hotlines and victim advocacy services.",
      "The Trump-era Justice Department added a new condition to those grants that denies funding to any program that \"violates (or promotes or facilitates the violation of) federal immigration law.\" That includes failing to \"give access to [Department of Homeland Security] agents, or honor DHS requests.\"",
      "But the states that joined Monday's lawsuit argue that the rule is illegal, since the Reagan-era law that set up the federal government's crime victim grant programs doesn't say anything about immigration enforcement.",
      "\"The challenged conditions would force these States into an untenable position: either forfeit access to critical resources for vulnerable crime victims and their families, or accept unlawful conditions, allowing the federal government to conscript state and local officials to enforce federal immigration law,\" the states and D.C. argue in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Rhode Island.",
      "Mostly Democratic states joined the suit, including California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota and Colorado. Collectively, they've received more than $500 million a year in crime victim grants since 2021, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The states asked a federal judge to block the new rules and declare them illegal. They said they need \"urgent relief\" since applications for most of the grants are due Wednesday.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "As President Trump seeks to dramatically ramp up arrests of suspected undocumented immigrants, his administration has taken aim at so-called sanctuary cities and states, which generally limit local police from cooperating with federal immigration agents.",
      "Within hours of his swearing-in on Jan. 20, the president signed an executive order directing officials to ensure that sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the Justice Department to identify and pause grants to groups that \"support or provide services to removable or illegal aliens.\"",
      "The administration argues that sanctuary cities and states make it harder to enforce immigration laws, especially against criminals who end up in state or local custody.",
      "Supporters of sanctuary laws, however, argue that forcing local law enforcement officers to work with immigration agents makes migrants less likely to cooperate with the police. Monday's lawsuit said the conditions on crime victim grants risk \"destroying trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities that is critical to preventing and responding to crime.\"",
      "\"The federal government is attempting to use crime victim funds as a bargaining chip to force states into doing its bidding on immigration enforcement,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.",

      "By adding outside troops to join the existing National Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers temporarily assigned to Washington, Mr. Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though district officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.",

      "The settlement comes after Fox News Channel paid $787.5 million\u00a0to settle a similar lawsuit in 2023 and Newsmax paid what court papers describe as $40 million to settle a libel lawsuit from a different voting machine manufacturer, Smartmatic, which also was a target of pro-Trump conspiracy theories on the network.",
      "Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis had ruled earlier that Newsmax did indeed defame Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems by airing false information about the company and its equipment. But Davis left it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages. Newsmax and Dominion reached a settlement before the trial could take place.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Monday, a Dominion spokesperson said the company was \"pleased to have settled this matter.\"",
      "The settlement originally came to light in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Newsmax, which was dated Friday, Aug. 15, the day that a deal was reached, according to the document. Newsmax has agreed to pay the settlement in three installments of $27 million, $20 million and $20 million, with the final installment to be paid in January 2027, the filing said.",
      "Newsmax continues to deny allegations that suggest its coverage of Dominion in the context of the 2020 election was defamatory.",
      "\"Newsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020,\" the company said in a statement published on its website. \"We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\"",
      "The disclosure of the settlement came as Mr. Trump, who lost his 2020 reelection bid to former President Joe Biden, vowed in a social media post Monday to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines, such as those supplied by Dominion and other companies, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. It was unclear how the Republican president could achieve that.",
      "\"I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we're at it, Highly 'Inaccurate,' Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election,\" Mr. Trump wrote in the post.",
      "The same judge also handled the Dominion-Fox News case and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Mr. Trump's allies about his 2020 loss, despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were bogus. At the time, Davis found it was \"CRYSTAL clear\" that none of the allegations was true.",
      "Internal correspondence from Newsmax officials likewise shows they knew the claims were baseless.",
      "\"How long are we going to play along with election fraud?\" Newsmax host Bob Sellers said two days after the 2020 election was called for Biden, according to internal documents revealed as part of the case.",
      "Newsmax took pride that it was not calling the election for Biden, and internal documents show it saw a business opportunity in catering to viewers who believed Mr. Trump won. Private communications that surfaced as part of Dominion's earlier defamation case against Fox News also revealed how the network's business interests intersected with decisions it made related to coverage of Mr. Trump's 2020 election claims.",
      "At Newsmax, employees repeatedly warned against false allegations from pro-Trump guests such as attorney Sidney Powell, according to documents in the lawsuit. In one text, even Newsmax owner Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally, said he found it \"scary\" that Mr. Trump was meeting with Powell.",
      "Dominion was at the heart of many of the wild claims aired by guests on Newsmax and elsewhere, who promoted a conspiracy theory involving deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to rig the machines for Biden. The network retracted some of the more bombastic allegations in December 2020.",
      "Though Mr. Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there's no evidence they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president's biggest supporters knew they were false at the time. Mr. Trump's then-attorney general, William Barr, said there was no evidence of widespread fraud.",
      "Mr. Trump and his backers lost dozens of lawsuits alleging fraud, some before Trump-appointed judges. Numerous recounts, reviews and audits of the election results, including some run by Republicans, turned up no signs of significant wrongdoing or error and affirmed Biden's win.",
      "After returning to office, Mr. Trump pardoned those who tried to halt the transfer of power during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and directed his Department of Justice to investigate Chris Krebs, a former Trump cybersecurity appointee who had vouched for the security and accuracy of the 2020 election.",
      "As an initial trial date approached in the Dominion case earlier this year, Mr. Trump issued an executive order attacking the law firm that litigated it and the Fox case, Susman Godfrey. The order, part of a series targeting law firms that Mr. Trump has tussled with, cited Susman Godfrey's work on elections and said the government would not do business with any of its clients or permit any of its staff in federal buildings.",
      "A federal judge put that action on hold, saying the framers would view it as \"a shocking abuse of power.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democrats unveiled a proposal Friday that could give California's dominant political party an additional five U.S. House seats in a bid to win the fight to control Congress next year.",
      "The plan calls for an unusually timed reshaping of House district lines to greatly strengthen the Democratic advantage in the state ahead of midterm elections, when Republicans will be defending the party's fragile House majority.",
      "It amounts to a counterpunch to the Texas Republicans' plan to take five Democratically held seats and redraw them to favor the GOP at the urging of President Trump as he tries to avoid losing control of Congress and, with it, prospects for his conservative agenda in the later part of his term.",
      "The California effort seeks to take five of the state's nine GOP districts and make them more favorable to Democrats. Just like in Texas, however, it is by no means a guarantee that Democrats would win all five of these seats if a new California map becomes law.",
      "Making the shift would likely require an amendment to California's state Constitution. Overhauling the current map that is in law would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the state Assembly and state Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election.",
      "California lawmakers are scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 18 amid the redistricting talk. The California State Legislature will have a short time span to move forward.",
      "If approved by voters in a special election this November, the California blueprint could nearly erase Republican House members in the nation's most populous state. The Democratic plan is intended to win the party 48 of its 52 U.S. House seats, up from 43 currently.",
      "The proposal was released by the campaign arm of House Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Democrats in the state Legislature will hold hearings and plan to vote on the new maps next week.",
      "\"This is about more than drawing lines on a map. It's about drawing a line in the sand to stop Texas and Trump from rigging the election,\" state Senate Democratic leader Mike McGuire said in a statement.",
      "New districts have boundaries to boost Democratic edge",
      "While a general notion behind drawing districts is to unite what's called communities of interest \u2014 neighborhoods and cities that share similar concerns or demographic traits \u2014 the proposed remapping would create a jigsaw of oddly shaped districts to maximize Democratic clout.",
      "The 1st Congressional District is currently anchored in the state's conservative far northeast corner and is represented by Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Trump supporter. The district has a nearly 18-point GOP registration edge.",
      "Under the proposal, Democrats would end up with a 10-point registration advantage in the district after drastic reshaping to include parts of heavily Democratic Sonoma County near the Pacific Coast.",
      "In a post on the social platform X, LaMalfa called the proposal \"absolutely ridiculous.\" LaMalfa's first congressional district would include parts of Santa Rosa under the proposed maps, an area that is in Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson's district.",
      "In the battleground 41st District east of Los Angeles, represented by long-serving Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, Democratic and Republican registration is currently split about evenly.",
      "But in the redrawn district, Democratic registration would jump to 46%, with GOP registration falling to 26%.",
      "Other Republicans whose districts would see major changes intended to favor Democrats include Rep. Kevin Kiley in Northern California, Rep. Ken Calvert in Riverside County, Rep. David Valadao in the Central Valley farm belt and Rep. Darrell Issa in San Diego County. Also, embattled Democratic incumbents would see their districts padded with additional left-leaning voters.",
      "\"Well, obviously, Newsom's entire goal was to revert to the era of drawing lines based upon partisan political factors, as politicians draw their lines,\" Kiley told CBS Sacramento earlier Friday.",
      "Kiley's current district covers suburbs, small towns and mountain communities from the Sacramento region to the Eastern California border.",
      "The release of the plan came the same day that Texas Republicans began a second special session to approve new congressional maps sought by Trump.",
      "The GOP's first special session in Texas ended without approving new political maps, thwarted by Democrats who staged a nearly two-week walkout that meant not enough lawmakers were present to pass any legislation. Gov. Greg Abbott then quickly called a second session that started without the necessary quorum to conduct business.",
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that his state will hold a Nov. 4 special referendum on the redrawn districts.",
      "\"We can't stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,\" Newsom said.",
      "The announcement marked the first time any state beyond Texas officially waded into Trump's fight, though several governors and legislative leaders from both parties have threatened such moves.",
      "Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who heads the House GOP campaign arm, said Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, is \"shredding California's Constitution and disenfranchising voters.\"",
      "\"Californians oppose Newsom's stunt because they won't let a self-serving politician rig the system to further his career,\" said Hudson, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
      "How will voters react?",
      "Under current law, California has an independent redistricting commission that was approved by voters earlier this century. Newsom has emphasized that the ballot effort would not get rid of the commission, though it would essentially suspend it. If the measure passes, the commission would then resume being able to write maps after the 2030 census.",
      "A big risk for Democrats is whether voters will be open to setting aside district boundaries crafted by the independent commission for ones shaped for partisan advantage.",
      "Some people already have said they would sue over the effort. Republican former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime opponent of partisan redistricting, signaled that he will not side with Democrats even after talking to Newsom. He posted a photo of himself Friday at the gym wearing a T-shirt that said, \"Terminate gerrymandering,\" with a reference to an obscenity and politicians.",
      "\"I'm getting ready for the gerrymandering battle,\" Schwarzenegger said.",
      "House control could come down to a few seats in 2026",
      "On a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.",
      "New maps are typically drawn once a decade after the census \u2014 the last being in 2020. Many states, including Texas, give legislators the power to draw maps. California is among those that empowers independent commissions with the task.",
      "If approved, a new California map would take effect only if a Republican state does its own redistricting. It would remain through the 2030 elections. After that, Democrats say, they would return mapmaking power to the independent commission voters approved in 2008.",
      "Hunter  Woodall and \n                                                  \n                      Nidia  Cavazos\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday as the U.S. pursues a long-lasting peace agreement to end Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the meeting early Saturday, following his\u00a0summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. In a post on Truth Social, the president said the meeting with Putin \"went very well,\" adding that the same was true of a phone call with Zelenskyy and various European leaders after the fact.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy will be coming to D.C., the Oval Office, on Monday afternoon,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.\"",
      "European and NATO leaders are expected to accompany Zelenskyy to Washington, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said she was joining at \"the request of President Zelenskyy.\"",
      "Though the nearly three-hour-long meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents on Friday failed to produce the ceasefire that Mr. Trump had sought, the administration has since pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to get there.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said, noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "The secretary of state, who attended Friday's summit meeting with Putin, indicated that enough progress was made to sit down with Zelenskyy to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "Rubio said the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories and the issue of rebuilding the country still need to be discussed and \"require some more specificity.\"",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer \"game-changing\" security guarantees, including a possible arrangement in which the allies provide \"Article 5-like protection\" to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member nation is considered an attack against all. Putin has been vehemently opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, but a similar security guarantee outside the framework of the alliance might reassure Kyiv that Russia would be deterred from attacking in the future.",
      "Witkoff noted that the administration intends to discuss a possible land swap at Monday's meeting.",
      "\"We're not waiting a week for a meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders,\" Witkoff said. \"We are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, very, very quickly. Quicker than a ceasefire.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post Sunday night, Mr. Trump said, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\" Mr. Trump was referring to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in early 2014.",
      "In a\u00a0post on X, Zelenskyy said he'd arrived in Washington for the talks and insisted, \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.\"",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued, with a wave of air strikes hitting cities around the country, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, CBS News partner network BBC News reported. Ukrainian authorities said a drone attack on a residential area in the city of Kharkiv overnight killed a toddler, a 16-year-old and five other people.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:35:56 -0400",
    "summary": "Former Attorney General William Barr is the first person scheduled to be deposed by Congress members as questions surrounding his role in the Epstein investigation persist.",
    "story": [
      "In the hours after convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan detention cell, then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr pledged to intervene personally to lead the investigation into Epstein's death.",
      "Among the first to arrive at the Metropolitan Correctional Center soon after Epstein's death in August 2019 were members of Barr's senior staff. The visit to the federal detention center by senior members of the attorney general's staff was highly unusual, a source who was there at the time and witnessed the visit told CBS News. But so was the death in custody of such a controversial figure.",
      "One source didn't recall ever seeing members of the attorney general's senior staff investigate an inmate death in more than 20 years. Another source, involved in the investigation, said such senior visits were rare, and if they occurred, usually pertained to promoting correctional programs, not investigating inmate deaths.",
      "Barr's involvement extended to a personal review of the approximately 11 hours of jail surveillance footage from the night of Epstein's death. He said in an interview with The Associated Press three months later that it showed no one had entered the area where Epstein was housed, and he concurred with the conclusion of the medical examiner: Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "Last month, after the FBI made that video public, an\u00a0analysis by CBS News identified inconsistencies between Barr's description of the video and what it actually showed \u2014 including whether it really proves no one else entered the cell block.",
      "Now, Barr is scheduled to appear on Monday on Capitol Hill, where he will be questioned behind closed doors by members of Congress conducting a review of the Epstein matter.",
      "Sources familiar with the oversight committee's plans tell CBS News they will be asking questions about Barr's involvement in the death investigation.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Barr for comment.",
      "The deposition of Barr, who served two Republican presidents as U.S. attorney general, comes as Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody has come under renewed, intense public and governmental scrutiny. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, issued several deposition subpoenas in August, including to Barr, former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and former FBI Director James Comey.",
      "Barr, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration who was serving his second stint as head of the Justice Department under President Trump at the time, said he was \"appalled\" when Epstein was found dead on Aug. 10, 2019, in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center.",
      "Epstein was being held at the now temporarily shuttered federal detention center after being arrested on sex trafficking charges that could have carried a life sentence. His arrest came after years of questions surrounding an earlier controversial prosecutorial deal in Florida where he pleaded to state prostitution charges and a federal felony case was dropped.",
      "Scrutiny around that deal, and his subsequent death, has fueled years of suspicions and conspiracy theories. The furor also has enveloped Epstein's vast network of powerful former friends, including Mr. Trump and former President Clinton, who have disavowed him and have not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Campaign promises to \"declassify\" files related to Epstein, made by Mr. Trump and his surrogates in 2024, have led to months of political headaches for the White House.",
      "The release last month of what the Justice Department called \"raw\" surveillance video from near Epstein's cell block, rather than settling questions about the night he died, raised new ones. The analysis by CBS News flagged multiple inconsistencies between the video and the 2023 report released by the Justice Department's Inspector General on Epstein's death.",
      "As Congress steps up its inquiry, Barr is the first person scheduled\u00a0to be deposed by the committee.",
      "Barr has acknowledged what he called \"a perfect storm of screw-ups\" at the jail, but said his \"personal review\" of surveillance footage supported the conclusion that Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "As attorney general, Barr faced calls to recuse himself from Epstein's criminal case because he had previously worked for a law firm, Kirkland and Ellis, that had represented Epstein. (Their paths also indirectly crossed decades earlier, in the early 1970s, when Epstein was hired to teach at an elite private school in New York City where Barr's father was the headmaster.)",
      "Here is a look at some unanswered questions Barr may be asked based on a review of the 2023 DOJ inspector general's report, documents released by the Bureau of Prisons, and the surveillance video.",
      "Questions for Barr about Jeffrey Epstein death investigation",
      "Did the video Barr reviewed from MCC have a missing minute?",
      "Before the supposedly \"raw\" surveillance video was released last month, showing about 11 hours of footage from the night Epstein died, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that one minute right before midnight was missing was because \"every night is reset, so every night should have the same missing minute,\" from 11:59 p.m. to midnight.",
      "That was later disputed by a government source familiar with the investigation in an interview with CBS News in July. Another high-level government source said the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General are in possession of full unedited copies of the video, and those copies do not have a missing minute. Why the FBI released the video with that small segment missing is unclear, and it is not known if anything notable occurred during that minute.",
      "Does Barr still believe that \"between the time Epstein was locked in his cell at 7:49 p.m. on the night of August 9 and the time he was discovered the next morning at 6:30 a.m., no one entered his tier\"?",
      "Barr made that statement in 2019, but the CBS News video analysis indicates the view from the jail camera does not conclusively prove no one entered Epstein's cell block. A staircase leading to Epstein's cell block is almost entirely out of view from the camera, with just a small sliver of stairs visible. From the video released publicly, experts told CBS News it is impossible to determine whether anyone entered the jail unit and accessed the staircase without being captured on the recording.",
      "Just before 10:40 p.m., the video shows a glimpse of an orange shape moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The inspector general's report said that it was a jail staffer bringing orange linens or inmate clothing up the stairs. Some video forensic experts who reviewed that footage at the request of CBS News said they were skeptical about that interpretation. They suggested the shape could be a person dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit climbing the stairs. Inmates were typically confined to their cells late at night.",
      "What did the DOJ do to investigate theories other than suicide?",
      "No evidence has surfaced suggesting that anyone else was involved in Epstein's death. He had been placed on suicide watch after an apparent attempt to hang himself a month before, and remained under heightened observation. However, there do remain significant unanswered questions about his death, some of which were raised in a \"60 Minutes\" report in 2020 looking at the medical evidence. Those included questions relating to the autopsy.",
      "A private autopsy commissioned by Epstein's family, conducted alongside the official examination by the medical examiner, raised concerns about the angle of the ligature marks on his neck and the presence of broken neck bones, findings that suggested a level of force greater than typically associated with a hanging. The medical examiner disputed that, saying such fractures can occur in suicides.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown announced a bid to once again represent Ohio in the Senate on Monday, nearly a year after his reelection effort in 2024 fell short.",
      "\"I didn't plan to run for office again. But when I see what's going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,\" Brown said in a video announcement. \"That's why I'm running for Senate, because even in these challenging times, I still believe if you stand up for workers, treat people with respect, and always fight for Ohio, you can actually make a difference.\"",
      "Brown, 72, lost his bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber last November against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno. Brown was the sole Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio and was one of the key targets for Republicans in the 2024 election in which they took control of the Senate.",
      "Brown had historically appealed to ticket-splitters with his strong working-class brand in the state, which he had represented in the Senate since 2007. But President Trump won Ohio by more than 10 percentage points, making Brown's election a steep uphill climb. Moreno beat him by less than four points.",
      "In 2026, Brown is set to face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who was appointed to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated. The special election will determine who will serve the remainder of Vance's term, meaning the winner would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "Husted, 57, was appointed in January by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, and previously served as DeWine's lieutenant governor.",
      "The Ohio race is expected to be a tough battle for Democrats, as the party seeks to retake the majority in the Senate. With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in a handful of potentially competitive states, while flipping four seats to retake a majority in 2026.",
      "While few races appear comfortably in range, Democrats have been working to recruit formidable candidates, like former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, to boost their chances. Brown's entrance into the race marks the latest recruiting victory for the party.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.",
      "\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called it \"game-changing.\"",
      "Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.",
      "Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.",
      "Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not \"go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.\"",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. \"We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' \u2014 including the European Union \u2014 is ready to do its share,\" she said.",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but said much was unclear.",
      "\"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said, \"But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees.\"",
      "Witkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.",
      "\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"",
      "Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.",
      "\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"",
      "Rubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"",
      "\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,\" Rubio said. \"That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday wrote on social media, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\"",
      "Zelenskyy and European leaders, who heard from Mr. Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.",
      "Rubio said of the talks with Russia, \"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Zelenskyy on Sunday night said on social media that he had arrived in Washington, D.C., for Monday's meeting, but pushed back on the Trump administration's comments about ceding territory to Russia.",
      "\"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably. And peace must be lasting. Not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East\u2014part of Donbas\u2014and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack,\" Zelenskyy wrote, adding \"Crimea should not have been given up then, just as Ukrainians did not give up Kyiv, Odesa, or Kharkiv after 2022.\"",
      "\"I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable assistance,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace. Thank you!\"",

      "Dozens of Texas House Democrats fled to blue states earlier this month after President Trump suggested the state should redraw its U.S. House district maps to secure more Republican seats. The Democrats have until now remained out of the state to deny Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott a quorum, temporarily derailing a special legislative session that the governor called to reshape the state's congressional maps.",
      "The GOP-led redistricting effort would create five more Republican-leaning House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. Republicans currently have a narrow majority in the House. Historically, the party that controls the White House typically loses ground in midterm elections. States usually redraw districts each decade to reflect population shifts after the decennial census.",
      "After successfully denying Texas Republicans a quorum multiple times in recent weeks, Democrats notched a small victory when the GOP wrapped the initial special session. With a new special session gaveled in on Friday, the Democrats have begun returning. Some are already in Texas, and the caucus is working on a count to tell whether the chamber will have a quorum Monday, the sources told CBS News.",
      "GOP officials in the state have threatened to arrest the lawmakers to compel their appearance at the state Capitol, and one Republican senator enlisted the help of the FBI to track down the legislators.",
      "The Democrats' return comes after they saw another victory with a push by California Democrats to combat the GOP advantage. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom formally announced a redistricting plan which, under California law, would require a special election. The California governor said the effort is happening \"in reaction to a president of the United States that called a sitting governor of the state of Texas and said 'find me five seats.'\"",

      "Isn't the root cause the fact that Russia invaded in the first place?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, ultimately, yes.",
      "But, I mean, what he means by root causes is this long historical complaints that we've heard repeatedly. This is not a new argument. He's been making this for a long time. And it's the argument that it's Western encroachment. I don't want to get into \u2013 it's just so long.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But the bottom line is that all of \u2013 you know, we're not going to focus on all of that stuff. We're going to focus on this, are they going to stop fighting or not, and what it's going to take to stop the fighting.",
      "And what it's going to take to stop the fighting, if we're being honest and serious here, is, both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this. And that's a very difficult thing to do. It's very difficult, because Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they were invaded, and the Russian side, because they feel like they have got momentum in the battlefield, and frankly, don't care, don't seem to care very much about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavor.",
      "They just churn through it. So I think what the president deserves a lot of credit for is the amount of time and energy that his administration is placing on reaching a peace agreement for a war that's not a war that started under him. It's half \u2013 you know, it's on the other side of the world.",

      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, tomorrow, we'll be meeting with President Zelenskyy. We'll be meeting with European leaders. We just met with Putin. He's dedicated a lot of time and energy because he has made it a priority of his administration to stop or end war, stop wars or prevent them.",
      "And, right now, this is the biggest war going on in the world. It's the biggest war in Europe since World War II. We're going to continue to do everything we can to reach an agreement that ends the dying and the killing and the suffering that's going on right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "You know this well, how long these kind of diplomatic negotiations often take. President Trump was telling European leaders what was discussed was Putin demanding control of Donetsk, a region in the east that his forces do not fully hold. And the U.K. estimates that taking that full area could be as long as another four years.",
      "Putin also is demanding Russian be an official language in Ukraine and something regarding Russian Orthodox churches. Did the U.S. accept all of what Putin laid out at that table?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The United States is not in a position to accept anything or reject anything, because, ultimately, it's up to the Ukrainians. They're the ones that Russia has to make peace with, and Ukraine with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president said he did come to some agreements.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's up to the Ukrainians to make these conditions.",
      "Well, the agreements were that we were going to try to do things like, for example, get a leader \u2013 a leaders meeting. We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war.",
      "Now, there were some concepts and ideas discussed that we know the Ukrainians could be very supportive of in that meeting. I don't think it's \u2013 we're not going to negotiate this in the media. I understand that everybody wants to know what happened.",
      "But, ultimately, there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potentials for progress. We'll be discussing that more in depth tomorrow with our European allies, with the Ukrainians that are coming over. We'll be discussing all of these things, because, ultimately, we do need to find areas where we're making progress and try to begin to narrow the gap between the two sides.",
      "But there's a reason why this war has been going on for 3.5 years. And that is, when it comes to the big issues here, there are still some big differences between both sides. Let's see how much progress we can continue to make. It's \u2013 it's \u2013 it's not been easy, but it's something the president has made a priority, peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And he deserves a lot of credit for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, ultimately, if \u2013 if Vladimir Putin is going to be offered land that he has not seized yet, but negotiates his way into, doesn't this set a dangerous precedent that the United States now accepts this concept that it is OK to seize land by force?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, Putin has already seized land by force, and that, in and of itself, is not a positive precedent. This whole war is a negative president \u2013 precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you demanding withdrawal?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, here's the \u2013 in order to have a deal here to end \u2013 to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. That's just a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean accepting\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: In any negotiation, if\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 where Russian forces are now?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, but, if \u2013 but this is not about acceptance. This is about what Ukraine can accept and what Russia can accept. They both have to accept it. Otherwise, there won't be a peace deal, OK?",
      "If there aren't concessions, if one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender. That's called the end of the war through surrender. And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender or anything close to it.",
      "So, in order for there to be a peace deal \u2013 this is just a fact. We may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it's not going to get.",
      "Both sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table in order to make this happen. That's \u2013 that's just the way it is. And, I mean, the sooner we accept that, that's the reality.",
      "Now, what those things are is going to be up to both sides. There's no conditions that can be imposed on Ukraine. They're going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too. And so, for example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have \u2013 to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security.",
      "That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on. Territories will have to be discussed. It's just a fact. And there are things that maybe Russia is holding now that they're going to have to give up. Who knows?",
      "The point is, we need to create a scenario where that becomes possible. And that's why this has been so hard, because neither side, up to now, has been willing to give on some of these things. But we'll see if that's possible. It may not be, but we're going to try, and we're going to do everything we can to try to achieve a peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand you \u2013 you can't get into specifics in a public conversation, but we're looking at Russian troops and strikes intensifying. Did you hear anything from Vladimir Putin that indicated he is willing to make a single concession?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think there are a couple. I mean, there were not enough for Ukraine. If not, we would be announcing a peace deal this morning, right?",
      "But \u2013 but, certainly, there are some things we notice, changes. There are some changes that I think are possible. I think there's some concepts that were discussed that could potentially lead to something. But, again, all these things have to be verifiable. We \u2013 it isn't real until it's real.",
      "I mean, you \u2013 one thing is what you say you might be willing to consider. Another thing is your willingness to do it. And it always becomes a tradeoff in all of this. But you talk about the intensifying strikes on the Russian side. Yes, I mean, they're a full-time war machine. I mean, that's what's happening. The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy.",
      "They have a lot of people. It's a big country. It's not just large geographically. It has huge populations. It continues to churn through people. You know, they lost \u2013 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed last month in July in this war. That just tells you the price they're willing to pay.",
      "Not saying any of this is admirable. I'm saying that this is the reality of the war that we're facing. It's become attrition in some ways. It's a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about the security bit you just mentioned there, because Italy's prime minister says that President Trump revived the idea of security guarantees inspired by NATO's Article 5 and a collective security clause that would involve the United States.",
      "How does that work?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are these U.S. troops? Are these U.S. monitors?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's what we're going to be working on. Well, that's what we're going to be working on.",
      "That's why \u2013 that's one of the reasons why, you know, I talked yesterday to all the national security advisers, a bunch of them from the different European countries. There are European leaders coming here tomorrow, heads of state coming tomorrow, along with President Zelenskyy, to discuss this in more detail.",
      "I mean, the constructs of something like this needs to be built out. Once thing \u2013 it's \u2013 a concept is one thing. The reality, you know, how it's built and how it would work, is another. But those are the kinds of talks that we're going to be having with them, along with some of the other issues that are at play.",
      "But that \u2013 that is one of the \u2013 if you were to break this thing down, I mean, there are \u2013 obviously, there needs to be an agreement on territories and where the lines are going to be drawn. That's not going to be very easy. That's going to be tough. I think there has to be some discussion about security guarantees for Ukraine, because they don't want this war to \u2013 none of us want to see this war in the future.",
      "They're a sovereign country. They have a right to have security agreements with other countries and security alliances with other countries. And then there's the whole issue of reconstruction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including United States?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: How do you rebuild the country?",
      "Well, potentially. Like I said, that's what we're going to be having a conversation about, and that's what we're going to be meeting \u2013 that's why they're all coming here tomorrow. And that's why we've been talking on the phone for the last 48 hours with them.",
      "And even leading up to it, throughout the week, there were various meetings just to sort of build out some of these ideas. So all of these right now are ideas. They are concepts that require some more specificity. We'll need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.",
      "And I think that's an area where potential progress is real, but that alone won't be enough. There's a bunch of other things that have to be worked through here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, Russia claims it has rescued 700,000 children. I know you know that the warrant out for Vladimir Putin's arrest is for the state-sponsored abduction of kids.",
      "I have seen estimates there are something like 30,000 Ukrainian children who have been abducted. Is the United States demanding, or at least, even just as a statement of goodwill here, that Russia return these children?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean, we've repeatedly raised that issue on \u2013 in every forum possible.",
      "And those have also been, by the way, topics of discussion, not just in our meetings with the Ukrainians, but in the negotiations and talks that were going on between Ukraine and Russia at the technical level. These talks were going on in Turkey, as an example, Turkey, over the last few months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and nothing so far from the Russians.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's been a topic of discussion as well.",
      "Well, it's unfortunate. Children should be returned to their families. We - - on that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side. And they shouldn't even be, you know, a bargaining chip in regards to a broader negotiation.",
      "But it's just one more element of how tragic this war is. After 3.5 years, this war is getting worse. It's not getting better. You've made the point about the uptick in strikes. This is a war. It's going to get worse. It's not going to get better. And that's why the president is investing so much time in bringing this to an end.",
      "And, by the way, everyone is begging us to be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The Europeans want us involved. The Ukrainians want us involved. Obviously, the Russians want us involved, because the president is the only leader in the world \u2013 if this is possible, he's the only one that can help make it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he's got the leverage over Vladimir Putin if he wanted to crush his economy or at least do more damage to it.",
      "But you have held off on those secondary sanctions. President Trump told Fox News his advice to President Zelenskyy is: \"Make a deal. Russia's a very big power and they're not.\"",
      "You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as back up tomorrow. Can you reassure them?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, it isn't. That's not why they're coming as back \u2013 that's not true. No, but that's not \u2013 why would \u2013 that's not true.",
      "They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming \u2013 in fact, they're coming here tomorrow because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that February Oval Office meeting in front of television cameras, where President Zelenskyy was dressed down\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Do you know how many meetings we've had since then?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, no, I know. And I was just up in Alaska\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, but we've had a bunch of meetings since then.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 watching the one with Vladimir Putin, where a red carpet was rolled out for the Russian leader.",
      "It was very different.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, but with Zelenskyy \u2013 we've had more meetings - - we've had \u2013 we've had \u2013 we've had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy.",
      "So, that \u2013 but that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the U.K. over the following \u2013 the previous weekend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they said President Trump was going to demand a cease-fire.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The president's talked to these leaders as early as Thursday.",
      "No, no, but you said that they're coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming here tomorrow \u2013 this is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because the \u2013 Trump is going to bully Zelenskyy into a bad deal.",
      "We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president told those European leaders last week that he wanted a cease-fire. The president went on television, said he would walk out of the meeting if Vladimir Putin didn't agree with on \u2013 he said there would be severe consequences if he didn't agree to one. He said he'd walk out in two minutes.",
      "He spent three hours talking to Vladimir Putin, and he did not get one. So, there's some mixed messages.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Because, obviously, something \u2013 things happened during that meeting.",
      "Well, because obviously things \u2013 look, our goal here is not to stage some production, for the world to say, oh, how dramatic. He walked out. Our goal here is to have a peace agreement, to end this war, OK? And, obviously, we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress, not a lot of progress, but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.",
      "If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here. We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now, understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.",
      "You talk about the sanctions. Look, at the end of the day, if peace is not going to be possible here, and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands. The president has that option to then come in and impose new sanctions.",
      "But if he did this now \u2013 the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year-and-a-half of war and death and destruction. We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there.",
      "We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war, so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here. We're going to do everything possible to make that happen, if it's doable.",
      "It will require both sides to make concessions. It will require both sides to get things they're asking for. That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, quickly, why did the State Department just announce that they're halting visitor visas for all Gazans coming here for medical aid? Why would some of these kids, for example, who are coming to hospitals for treatment be a threat?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, it's not just kids. It's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them.",
      "Second, we had outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it. And so we're going to reevaluate how those visas are being granted, not just to the children, but how those visas are being granted to the people who are accompanying them, and, by the way, to some of the organizations that are facilitating it.",
      "There is evidence been presented to us by numerous congressional offices that some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas. And so we are not going to be in partnership with groups that are friendly with Hamas.",
      "So we need to \u2013 we're going to pause those visas. There was just a small number of them issued to children, but they come with adults accompanying them, obviously. And we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the \u2013 to the process of acquiring those visas.",
      "We're not going to be in partnership with groups that have links or sympathies towards Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, we have to leave it there for this morning. Thank you for joining us.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow.",
      "Good to see you in person.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-Colorado): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee.",
      "The secretary of state just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they have been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States screens all visas. So is there really a blind spot that you are aware of?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But, if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the secretary of state?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "On Ukraine, you know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will.",
      "But what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it, right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it.",
      "In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick in this instance? Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego \u2013 we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out.",
      "He doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict, if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts.",
      "And this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here. And they haven't pulled back. They would need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions.",
      "But bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, there's no doubt.",
      "As you know, I was one of the members of Congress that on a bipartisan basis pushed really hard in the first two years of this war under the Biden administration to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win.",
      "And I do believe that, had we done more, and we had done \u2013 done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today.",
      "But compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like, look at what happened on Friday.",
      "U.S. military personnel in uniform literally were on their hands and knees rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century, somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children, somebody who started this whole war, right?",
      "This both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate, Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform.",
      "I wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article 5- like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go, but, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee.",
      "I think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military, but we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that would put pressure on Vladimir Putin and actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine.",
      "There's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets. And the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The last administration was too.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation.",
      "But on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see? And how does that compare to the last administration?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years.",
      "And oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does, Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals, and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE, made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States, bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined.",
      "And they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they are trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And we will see where that heads next.",
      "Jason Crow, thank you.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "Fiona Hill served as the senior director for Russia and European affairs on the National Security Council during President Trump's first term. She joins us now from Waterville, Maine.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "FIONA HILL (Former NSC Senior Director, European and Russian Affairs): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Fiona, you were an advisor during that infamous Helsinki summit in 2018. You've spoke about that in the past. I wonder what you think about how this Alaska summit compared.",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, obviously quite different in \u2013 in many respects. Part of it was the fact that they decided to skip the one-on-one meeting and the lunch. I mean these are usually part of this sort of set of summits like this. And the press conference, obviously, was more of an announcement or a set of announcements. Presentations by both leaders, much more by President Putin, and more of a commentary by President Trump. So, there wasn't that free for all of press questions, which I'm sure was a bit disconcerting for you and others who were present there at Alaska.",
      "But the optics weren't exactly great, as Congressman Crow has laid out, for the United States and for President Trump again. I mean, again, different. But although it was presented as perhaps a show of power by being at a U.S. Air Force Base with the flight passing of the B-52s and the fighter jets, it did certainly looked much more like a show of appreciation for Vladimir Putin. And so the optics were really much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin set the agenda there, the narrative, and in many respects the tone for the whole summit meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, saying that, you know, the president has a team of advisors around him. In a traditional administration, those advisors would be setting the policy, they would be planning the optics, and they would be thinking through that.",
      "Do you think that the president's team set him up for success here?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, it may well have been that one of the demands, because we've heard from Secretary Rubio, which, I have to say, I think was a very fair assessment of where things are. So, it may well have been that one of the demands by the Russians to make any progress in moving further forward was to actually have that kind of show of pomp and pageantry that is \u2013 basically marks Putin's re-entry into international affairs. Maybe the Russians said to them in Moscow, either to Steve Witkoff or to Secretary Rubio or to anybody else that basically they wanted to have a \u2013 a major U.S./Russia bilateral summit appearance before they would move on to the nitty-gritty of anything else in Ukraine. That's, you know, to give them all the benefit of the doubt there.",
      "But it all now depends on what comes out of this. And I think, again, Secretary Rubio made it very clear that it's not going to be easy. He was certainly downplaying any expectations of a major breakthrough, but he did say that it was something that might be possible. And I think that's what's going to be the proof of whether this was actually worth all the effort that they went to in Alaska or not.",
      "And as Congressman Crow said, there's a pretty high bar here because what Putin is doing is pretty brutal. And he's not showing right now any signs whatsoever of giving anything up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom's defense secretary has said that they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help oversee a ceasefire. When you hear these security guarantees being talked about, and the secretary said he is going to negotiate that tomorrow, what should we think \u2013 you know, what form is that going to take? What do you think that should look like?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, I think he actually let this out, and you did too in your questions. And I think Congressman Crow has made it very clear as well, it has to be a combination of all of the things that we've already heard discussed on the show today. You have to be able to have some boots on the ground. Congressman Crow said it doesn't have to be the United States. That's actually the case. But it actually has to be some commitment from the United States to enable European forces to actually hold that territory and to provide some security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "The United States is key in terms of its intelligence, in terms of enabling equipment and the information of the data that we would need for all of this to make a security intervention mean something. And it's also essential in terms of all kinds of other forms of equipment and defensive weaponry. We've already heard, of course, about Ukraine needing all kinds of equipment, from javelins in the past, to patriots, now in terms of an integrated missile defense system that Ukraine desperately needs. So, there's a lot there that we all know needs to be done.",
      "And what we really need to see, I think, in these meetings that will take place on Monday and moving forward, is a real commitment to the United States to work with Europeans and to work with Ukraine to make this happen.",
      "Look, this is existential also for European security. So, minimizing the role of Europe here, be it the United Kingdom, be it Poland, be it Finland, be it France, be it Germany, is not the way to go. Europe has to have an equal say in all of this. This is about Europe's future and the future of European security, not just about Ukraine's.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. You know both men. You've written biographies of Vladimir Putin and, of course, you served under Donald Trump. In one of the Fox interviews that President Trump did, he said that he spoke about mail- in voting in the United States with Vladimir Putin. And during that press address, Putin also claimed that the war wouldn't have happened at all if Donald Trump had been pretty. I mean that's a counter factual, but that's something Trump often says on the \u2013 on the trail. Why would those things be discussed at all if this was about Ukraine?",
      "FIONA HILL: Exactly. Well, look, this is Vladimir Putin, as usual, trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. I've seen him do this over and over again, including at Helsinki when he set the president off, not in the press conference, but before that, in a whole diatribe against his political enemies because Putin deliberately asked him about this.",
      "So, Putin knows that President Trump wants to have an acknowledgment of his self-assertion, that the war wouldn't have happened had he not \u2013 had he been in the presidency. And so Putin's giving him something that plays well for President Trump and his own domestic environment. It doesn't play well in the international environment where people know things are much more complicated but it's basically gifting a concession to President Trump himself.",
      "And Putin wants to sow chaos in the American electoral system ahead of the midterms. So, of course, he's laid into this whole issue of mail-in voting. And President Trump asserted in his Fox News interview that there were no countries in the world that allow mail-in voting. Well, Russia allows mail- in voting. And if everybody wants to go out and look, they can look for themselves. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin signed into law Russians being able to vote by mail and also on the internet. And more than 30 other countries also allow some forms of mail-in voting. So, it's just not true that other countries, including Russia, don't use this. It's a pure blatant piece of manipulation, and that's the kind of thing that Putin likes to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, of course, I don't think you would endorse the outcome of that voting system and those elections are rigged in Russia, correct?",
      "FIONA HILL: Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: And, I mean, basically Putin wants to see us tie ourselves up in knots between now and the midterms. He's trying to sew chaos. And he's just better used his time with President Trump to push that along.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: It's \u2013 again, it's a diversion. It's a distraction really from the negotiations on Ukraine because Putin doesn't really want to give anything up. So, he gives up basically something that plays well in the political arena for President Trump and something that actually plays very badly for the United States in its own political arena, which is the mail- in voting point that he made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, always appreciate your analysis. Thank you for joining us today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During our trip to Alaska last week for the Trump/Putin summit, we talked with Alaskan Republican Senator Dan Sullivan about the strategic military importance of Alaska. We began by asking about potential offers to Putin to get him to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Telegraph\" was reporting offering Putin a chance to invest in the natural resources off of Alaska's coast, in the Bearing Strait.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN (R-AK): Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, we have plenty of America investors and our allies who want to invest in Alaska's natural resources. We're having a boom here. We don't need Russian investments. We don't need Russian money. They're a competitor of ours when it comes to energy and natural resources and critical minerals. So, I doubt that's on the table. And, you know, I would not \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You'd be upset if there was?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I would not \u2013 I would not support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And by the way, just to \u2013 on that point though, a contrast. You might remember last time I was on your show we talked about the Biden administration \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about this.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: With this great state of ours.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Shutting us down, right? I mean that was 70 executive orders to shut down, exclusively focused on Alaska, shut down our resource development economy. Our own federal government, the Biden administration, sanctioned my state more than they sanctioned Iran. What we're seeing with President Trump in his administration is a complete 180 on that. Unleashing Alaska's resource potential has been a huge focus of the president since day one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you mentioned how furious you were with the Biden administration for the executive actions they said they were taking to protect natural resources.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said land conservation was necessary, and the indigenous population here really wanted it.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Right. Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You called it a lie.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I did call it a lie. It was a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said it was national security suicide. Trump has already reversed this.",
      "But are you at all concerned that there are short-term benefits to your state financially, but longer term real damage to the environment here?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: No. Look, Alaska has an incredible record of being able to develop our resources and protect the environment. You walk around here, you see what a pristine, beautiful environment we have here. But we know we need jobs. We need natural resource development. So, we can do both. The entire north slope of Alaska, the Nupiet (ph) community, across the board was against what the Biden administration did, which was lock up the entire natural petroleum reserve of Alaska, which was set aside by Congress to develop our resources. And then he had the audacity to say, hey, I did this on behalf of the native people. That was not true at all. It was an outrage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, for activists or for those concerned about the damage here \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say they just don't know what they're talking about?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, I say \u2013 well, a couple things. There's no place on the planet that has higher standards on protecting the environment than us. And if we need American energy, why would we go, like the Biden administration did, begging from Iran, Venezuela, places that have no environmental standards, when you can get it from America, from American workers, with the highest environmental standards any place on the planet. And secondly, when you have resource development, particularly in our rural communities, you see life expectancies increases \u2013 increasing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in this region \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Arctic is of supreme concern from a national security perspective.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The ice is melting.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Majority of scientists attribute that to global warming, but the end result is there's a potential for an Arctic area for trade routes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also tapping into the natural resources there.",
      "How does the United States gain an edge in \u2013 in dominating that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, it's a great question. It's really important. You're mentioning trade routes that are opening up. We've already talked about natural resources, which are huge, up in the Arctic. And what we need to do is recognize that we're an Arctic nation. We're an Arctic nation because of Alaska.",
      "And, look, this has not always been a priority of previous administrations. What we're doing up here, we're rebuilding our military. The one big, beautiful bill certainly does it. As I mentioned, you know, Alaska exudes military might. We're the cornerstone of missile defense, and we're going to be the cornerstone of the president's golden dome initiative. We are the hub of air combat power. You're seeing them flying over here. We have over 100 fifth generation fighters based in Alaska. We have a brand-new U.S. Army airborne division up here. So, we are building out our military, which is great, but also building out our Arctic capabilities.",
      "And again, in the one big, beautiful bill, almost $26 billion investment in the Coast Guard, which is the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history by far, 16 icebreakers coming with that, 22 cutters, 40 helicopters, a bunch of shore side infrastructure, a lot of that's going to be in Alaska to defend the Arctic. And we need to defend the Arctic because, as you and I have talked about, the Russians and the Chinese are in our waters and in our airspace all the time, including doing joint operations up here, which is unprecedented.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about that because the war in Ukraine has hurt Russia's finances \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Made them more dependent on Beijing, including when it comes to exploring up and around the Arctic.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They had a joint bomber task force come here \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pretty darn close.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Oh, they were in our ADIZs, as they \u2013 as we call it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Air Defense Identification Zone.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you concerned this actually becomes a flashpoint?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I think this is already becoming a flash point. I mean the number of times that the Russians and Chinese are doing joint strategic bomber task forces in our airspace and joint naval task forces in our EEZ, in our waters, they're \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic Zone?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. That's happening on a regular basis now, that's unprecedented. They don't do joint operations anywhere else on America's borders. That's for sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee says there is far more needed for the U.S. military than what has been provided by the White House and their budget.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We need to do more and we certainly need to keep it above 3 percent of GDP and growing towards 4 or 5 percent of GDP. It's a dangerous world right now.",
      "But this one big, beautiful bill, the budget reconciliation bill does a lot for our military right now on urgent needs. Shipbuilding. As we have talked about, our Navy, our ability to build ships is completely atrophied. Weapons and ammo systems. The golden dome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you have your own proposal.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But has the Pentagon told you what the golden dome is?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: All right, I mean, I've been working on this with the Pentagon. This is missile defense that is a layered missile defense. So, what that means is, right here, like I said, you have the ground-based missile interceptor \u2013 the missile interceptors in Alaska. You have all the radar systems in Alaska that protect the whole country in terms of ballistic missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We have new threats. We have hypersonics. We have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense. Not just the ground-based system here, but you work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THAD, and then including space-based systems, both for tracking and intercepting. And you to do that with an open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems. So, I am very familiar with what the golden dome is doing and I'm leading the effort in the Senate on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And, by the way, my state is the cornerstone of all the missile defense right now and will continue to be so.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can find more from our interview with Dan Sullivan on our website, facethenation.com and our YouTube page.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza where the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reports that the total number of starvation- related deaths has now risen to 250, including 110 children. Seven of those deaths in the last 24 hours.",
      "World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres joins us this morning from Jerusalem. He visited Gaza late last week.",
      "Good morning.",
      "JOSE ANDRES (Founder, World Central Kitchen): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It is rare to get a look inside of Gaza. The IDF does not allow journalists in to freely report. But they let you in. What did you see?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: It was a day trip. I was able to go early in the day and leave before sunset. And I visit our main \u2013 one of our two main kitchens inside Gaza in Derbala (ph). And I was able to visit the few warehouses we have there, the bakery, the kitchens. And I spending a day trying to see what else the teams need, what else we need to be doing, how we are going to be increasing the hot food and bread we are producing right now. So, it was a day again to show support, to see on my own and assess the situation of our own kitchens. And \u2013 and that's how \u2013 what I have to report with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.N. says that there is starvation happening in Gaza. Israel's prime minister says there is no starvation. What's real?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: Obviously, there is always a gray area. But we are making boxes for children that we know they are in very special need situation. I saw those boxes be made with the name of every one of the children. We need to remember that during many weeks no food was going inside Gaza. And this is to 2 million people.",
      "So, in the places we know we're feeding, we are doing around 200,000 meals a day, but this is only 10 percent of the need. That's why we are trying to increase.",
      "I can say that where we are, obviously people are \u2013 are \u2013 are being fed. At the very minimum. It's not everything they should be receiving, but at the very least they are receiving a piece of bread and a piece of food.",
      "But we need much more aid. We need to make sure that the aid is never interrupted again. We need to make sure that the flow of trucks keeps happening. We need to make sure that we have safe roads so those trucks can reach their intended delivery place. We need to make sure that all the NGOs that are actively trying to do the best they can to take care of people inside Gaza, and this is beyond food, obviously medicine, et cetera, et cetera, we need to make sure that the aid is massive enough that we don't get to those moments where in some areas, like in the north, that these are still very difficult to reach, that we know that people are desperate for food.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned for many weeks no food was allowed in. That was a government policy. There was a blockade for many months. That is now lifted officially.",
      "But as you say, your organization wants to scale up. You are trying to produce 1 million meals a day in Gaza. Can you get the fuel in to do that? Can you get the food in? Are Israeli officials giving you a green light?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: Well, it's a million because we \u2013 we are an organization that we specialize in emergencies and in food. But really we are requesting that all the NGOs that are participating in feeding are giving more access, including us, and other organizations, like Anera (ph), which was one of the organizations we work with that they have been in Gaza for many, many decades, and many others. We need to make sure that everybody has access. For that we need a lot of things. The trucks inside Gaza. We need to remember that the trucks come from outside Gaza. And they are \u2013 they are put aside. And then we need to reload the trucks that are inside Gaza. This takes time. We need more trucks inside. So, the trucking company can have enough people and enough trucks to have a constant flow.",
      "I have to report that as I saw a good flow of trucks going in, around 150 to 250 trucks are going in every day. But even I would say that this is not enough. We need to make sure that we massively increase, that we massively make sure that nobody has to be walking for miles to try to reach a place where they can find a plate of food or use a bag of rice. We need to make sure like what World Central Kitchen does. At one moment we had, you know, 100 to 200 kitchen partners. We need to make sure that we are cooking where people live. We need to make sure that we are feeding them where people are so the people don't have to be again leaving their neighborhoods, leaving their tents and walking for hours back and forth only to try to bring a little bit of food back home.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to end Russia's war in Ukraine, hinting at the road ahead for talks aimed at getting Moscow and Kyiv to reach a lasting peace agreement.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday following his\u00a0high-stakes summit with Putin in Alaska last Friday. Mr. Trump called the nearly three-hour meeting with Putin \"extremely productive\" with \"many points\" the two leaders agreed on. But \"there's no deal until there's a deal,\" he said, and no ceasefire was announced.",
      "Rubio, who attended the summit, was thin on details Sunday, saying that \"there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs.\" He added that the details would be discussed with Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Monday as the administration works to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "\"We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war,\" Rubio said, noting that there were \"some concepts and ideas discussed\" with Putin that they expect the Ukrainians would support.",
      "When asked whether the U.S. would demand Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory as part of an agreement, the secretary of state acknowledged that both sides would have to make concessions in order to reach a deal to end the conflict.",
      "\"If one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender,\" Rubio said. \"And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender, or anything close to it.\"",
      "Rubio outlined a handful of areas where agreement needs to be reached, including the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories \"and where the lines are going to be drawn\" and the issue of rebuilding the country. He said the ideas \"require some more specificity,\" noting that the U.S. will \"need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.\"",
      "Monday's discussions come after Zelenskyy met with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February, when an Oval Office meeting descended into insults and chaos, exposing severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine.",
      "Rubio pushed back on the idea that European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington as backup to prevent him from accepting a bad deal after the contentious meeting earlier this year.",
      "\"We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff,\" Rubio said. \"They're coming here tomorrow because they're supposed to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.\"",
      "The secretary said that after the meeting with Putin, \"we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress \u2014 not a lot of progress \u2014 but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement,\" Rubio added. \"Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, appeared on \"Face the Nation\" after Rubio, and called the meeting with Putin a \"historic embarrassment\" while outlining what he says is needed to end the war.",
      "\"In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary, what is making Vladimir Putin tick, in this instance,\" Crow said.",
      "Crow argued that Putin doesn't care about things like a B-2 stealth bomber flyover and a lineup of F-22 fighter jets, which were part of a carefully choreographed red-carpet welcome in Alaska.",
      "\"What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things: He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions; he cares about political, diplomatic isolation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0being a pariah state; and he cares about military defeat,\" Crow said. \"Those are the three things that will end this conflict.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services instructed officers on Friday to consider additional factors when determining whether immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship have a \"good moral character.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is signaling it will more heavily scrutinize applications filed by legal immigrants seeking American citizenship, in its latest effort to tighten access to U.S. immigration benefits.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency overseeing the country's legal immigration system, instructed officers on Friday to consider additional factors when determining whether immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship have a \"good moral character.\"",
      "Typically, legal immigrants with U.S. permanent residency, also known as a green card, can apply for naturalized American citizenship after a 3- or 5-year period, depending on their case. Demonstrating \"a good moral character\" has long been one of the requirements in U.S. immigration law for American citizenship, alongside passing English and civics tests.",
      "For decades, under Republican and Democratic administrations, the \"good moral character\" assessment has generally been satisfied if applicants don't have any of the criminal offenses or disqualifying conduct outlined in U.S. immigration law. Those disqualifying factors range from violent crimes like murder and aggravated felonies to drug offenses and being a \"habitual drunkard.\"",
      "But a policy issued Friday by USCIS expands the \"good moral character\" assessment, saying that determination must involve \"more than a cursory mechanical review focused on the absence of wrongdoing.\" Instead, the review, the agency told its officers, should be \"a holistic assessment of an alien's behavior, adherence to societal norms, and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.\"",
      "The directive orders officers to place a \"greater emphasis\" on applicants' \"positive attributes and contributions,\" listing community involvement, family caregiving and ties, educational attainment, \"stable and lawful\" employment, the length of time spent in the U.S., and paying taxes as some of those factors.",
      "The memo also mandates \"greater scrutiny\" of factors that show applicants lack a \"good moral character,\" beyond the crimes and disqualifying conduct detailed in U.S. immigration law.",
      "Those factors, the policy said, include \"acts that are contrary to the average behavior of citizens in the jurisdiction where aliens reside,\" including actions that are \"technically lawful\" but also \"inconsistent with civic responsibility within the community.\" USCIS listed \"reckless or habitual traffic infractions, or harassment or aggressive solicitation\" as some of those actions.",
      "Lastly, the new USCIS policy instructs officers to weigh factors that could show that applicants who have engaged in wrongdoing have rehabilitated, such as complying with probation, paying overdue taxes or child support and receiving letters of support from their community.",
      "Over the past decade, the U.S. government has naturalized between 600,000 and 1 million immigrants as citizens annually, USCIS figures show.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, USCIS chief spokesman Matthew Tragesser said the directive is another effort by President Trump's administration to \"restore integrity\" to the U.S. immigration system.",
      "\"U.S. citizenship is the gold standard of citizenship \u2014 it should only be offered to the world's best of the best,\" Tragesser added. \"Today, USCIS is adding a new element to the naturalization process that ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character.\"",
      "Doug Rand, a former senior USCIS official during the Biden administration, suggested the Trump administration's policy is designed to scare legal immigrants from applying for American citizenship and require officers to put their \"thumb on the scale\" to find more reasons to deny applications.",
      "\"They're trying to increase the grounds for denial of U.S. citizenship by kind of torturing the definition of good moral character to encompass extremely harmless behavior,\" Rand said, citing the policy's reference to traffic infractions.",
      "While the Trump administration has launched a highly visible crackdown on illegal immigration by deploying thousands of troops to the southern border, expanding immigration raids across the country, and fast-tracking deportations of those in the U.S. illegally, it has simultaneously moved to restrict legal immigration, with less fanfare.",
      "The Trump administration has virtually shut down refugee admissions, terminated Biden-era programs that allowed migrants to enter the U.S. legally, limited visas for certain countries and implemented aggressive vetting procedures for legal immigration benefits. Those efforts include expanded vetting of social media activity of legal immigrants and stricter screening requirements for some applications.",

    "summary": "For more than 40 years, glaciologist Mauri Pelto has been measuring shrinking glaciers in Washington State. He's been joined by his daughter, artist-scientist Jill Pelto, whose watercolors provide another view of the drastically-changing landscape.",
    "story": [
      "In the rugged North Cascade Mountains of Washington State, no one likely knows this glacier better than Mauri Pelto, who says, \"My life has been shaped by this ice.\"",
      "For more than 40 years, Pelto, a glaciologist and a professor at Nichols College in Massachusetts, has returned to this remote wilderness. \"We got 6,000 measurements on this glacier,\" he said.",
      "Today, the crunch of footsteps in the snow is now rivaled by the sound of melting ice. \"It's always melting off,\" he said. \"The crevasses are changing. We can hear the water flowing under our feet.\"",
      "Pelto founded the North Cascade Glacier Climate Project as a grad student in 1984. He vowed to measure these glaciers every summer for 50 years. This is Year 42. In that time the glaciers have changed more than he has, shrinking by 40%. Some have disappeared.",
      "Pelto's work has been featured by NASA, and fed into a worldwide glacier database. Of the 47 glaciers he has studied, returning to them year after year, he says 12 are now gone, \"nine of them just in the last five years.\"",
      "Climate scientists say warmer summers and drier winters, driven by our burning of fossil fuels, are accelerating the loss. Seven of the 10 worst years for glacier melt worldwide have happened since 2010, according to Climate Central.",
      "Or just ask Mauri Pelto where the ice used to be. \"Almost 50 feet above my head just a decade ago,\" he said.",
      "Glaciers are Earth's water towers, storing 70% of the freshwater supply, vital for drinking, farming, and the health of many ecosystems. As they melt, sea levels are rising, and coastal flooding is getting worse.",
      "During his annual treks to the North Cascades, Pelto has hiked nearly 6,000 miles, and slept 800 nights in a tent. \u00a0\"We got our picture window,\" he said of the view. \"It's also one of those places that's really special to us as a family.\"",
      "His son Ben, daughter Jill, and now his nine-month-old granddaughter Wren have joined him in the field.",
      "Jill Pelto has spent 17 summers by her dad's side, but she doesn't just collect data. As the project's art director, she paints it. The data points that she and her dad measure eventually will go into her art. \"Data is a story about something in the real world and that story has meaning and emotion,\" she said. \"And that's what I'm trying to bring into my art.\"",
      "Her watercolor paintings are more than just beautiful landscapes; they reveal the science. Look closely and you see a bar graph of glacier decline in the North Cascades. One piece showing temperature rise and ice loss made the cover of Time magazine.",
      "Jill said, \"I think sometimes when people see data there's this instant reaction, and so it's not like the data is any different in my art, but something about that combination maybe gets people to kind of put down the wall of like, 'Oh, I can't understand this,' or 'You know, this is not something I'm interested in.'\"",
      "I said, \"The average person is not going to read a scientific report, but they will see a painting. And it does impact you in a different way.\"",
      "\"Yes, definitely,\" said Jill.",
      "Her art has given her dad a new way to share the story he's been recording for the past 42 years. And it's also changed their relationship: \"We do it so seamlessly at this point,\" Mauri said.",
      "\"Feels like you're one team out here?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied.",
      "Jill added, \"This bigger project just means so much to us and has shaped our lives. So, sharing that year after year is beyond special.\"",
      "And now, Mauri Pelto has just eight summers left to fulfill his 50-year promise. Asked what he thinks it will be like to no longer come out to the glaciers, Mauri replied, \"I don't know, I can't remember what it was like to not come out here. This landscape has been shaped by ice, and so to understand the landscape and the ice, you really have to walk across it.\"",

    "summary": "Federal funding cuts to mRNA technology research doesn't just impact COVID vaccines \u2014 experts say it could stall progress in treatment for cancers, rare disease and more.",
    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

SolarStratos is 9.6 meters long, and its huge wingspan of 24.8 meters accommodates the 22 square meters of high-spec solar panels topping the wings, and allows for flying at low speeds.",
      "The plane, which SolarStartos calls \"daring and finely engineered,\"\u00a0can take off at low speeds, from 50 kilometers per hour upwards. Its maximum speed is 140 kph, while its cruising speed is around 80 kph.",
      "\"Tomorrow can be better than what we have today\"",
      "In 2012, the pioneering Domjan became the first person to sail around the world in a fully solar-powered boat, a journey that began in Miami in 2010.",

      "\"This is what we want to achieve: it's really to show that the world of tomorrow can be better than what we have today,\" he added.",
      "A warm-up flight on July 31 got to 6,589 meters, surpassing the plane's previous best in 2024.",
      "A first attempt on Friday was quickly abandoned when the forecast thermals failed to materialize, saving the batteries for Sunday when the plane got to 8,224 meters.",
      "During the first phase of record attempts, the aircraft has to make maximum use of rising warm air currents to climb to around 4,000-5,000 meters. It then has to recharge its batteries at this altitude before climbing again.",
      "Before takeoff, the batteries must be fully charged using solar energy, and the plane has to land under its own power \u2014 it cannot glide back in on zero charge \u2014 and have at least 16% charge in the batteries.",
      "If the flight is to be certified as a record, all the energy used during the flight must have been produced by the solar cells. The current record was set in 2010 by the Solar Impulse experimental plane, with Swiss pilot Andre Borschberg at the controls.",

      "It's also introducing thousands of perishable grocery items to its offerings, and will expand services to a total of 2,300 new locales by the end of 2025. The move positions Amazon as a strong competitor to Instacart and Walmart+, both of which offer same-day grocery delivery services.",
      "The new delivery offerings include options from the produce, dairy, meat, seafood, baked goods and frozen foods departments. Additionally, customers can have households goods, electronics, apparel and more, delivered on the same day that the orders are placed.",
      "The service is available to Amazon Prime members for free, for orders that total at least $25. Nonmembers are also eligible for same-day delivery, but for a $12.99 fee.",
      "According to the company, more than 150 million Americans rely on Amazon, where they've spent $100 billion on groceries and household goods in 2024 alone \u2014 which doesn't include sales from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh.",
      "\"Overall, this expansion to offer same-day delivery of perishable groceries creates a one-stop shop for an array of customer needs,\" Telsey Advisory Group analysts said in a research note.",
      "They added, \"Importantly, we believe this is a strong move for Amazon, deepening relationships with and share of wallet among its Prime member customers, as well as positioning the company to compete better with other leaders in the grocery space, like Albertsons, Kroger, Target and Walmart.\"",
      "\"Order milk alongside electronics\"",

      "Raleigh, North Carolina; Milwaukee; Tampa, Florida and Columbus, Ohio; are among the new cities that Amazon is extending bringing same-day delivery to.",
      "The same-day grocery delivery service is distinct from Amazon's existing grocery delivery offerings including Amazon Fresh and through Whole Foods Market and local purveyors, the company said.",
      "The company said it's able to deliver perishable and temperature-sensitive goods by using insulated bags and more to ensure groceries remain at necessary temperatures throughout the delivery process.",

    "summary": "Last week, more than three years after being suspended from coaching, the FBI arrested Dean Gardner, 38, on a federal child pornography charge.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. gymnastics world was only just recovering from a devastating sexual abuse scandal when a promising young coach moved from Mississippi to Iowa to take a job in 2018 at an elite academy known for training Olympic champions.",
      "Liang \"Chow\" Qiao, the owner of Chow's Gymnastics and Dance Institute in West Des Moines, thought highly enough of his new hire, Sean Gardner, to put him in charge of the club's premier junior event and to coach some of its most promising girls.",
      "But four years later, Gardner was gone from Chow's with little notice.",
      "USA Gymnastics, the organization rocked by the Larry Nassar sex-abuse crisis that led to the creation of the U.S. Center for SafeSport, had been informed by the watchdog group that Gardner was suspended from all contact with gymnasts.",
      "The reason for Gardner's removal wasn't disclosed. But court records obtained exclusively by The Associated Press show the coach was accused of sexually abusing at least three young gymnasts at Chow's and secretly recording others undressing in a gym bathroom at his prior job in Mississippi.",
      "Last week, more than three years after being suspended from coaching, the FBI arrested Gardner, 38, on a federal child pornography charge. But his disciplinary case has still not been resolved by SafeSport, which handles sex-abuse cases in Olympic sports.",
      "In cases like Gardner's, the public can be in the dark for years while SafeSport investigates and sanctions coaches. SafeSport requires that allegations be reported to police to ensure abusers don't run unchecked outside of sports, but critics say the system is a slow, murky process.",
      "\"From an outward operational view, it seems that if SafeSport is involved in any way, the situation turns glow-in-the-dark toxic,\" said attorney Steve Silvey, a longtime SafeSport critic who has represented people in cases involving the center.",
      "While acknowledging there can be delays as its investigations unfold, SafeSport defended its temporary suspensions in a statement as \"a unique and valuable intervention\" when there are concerns of a risk to others.",
      "Nevertheless, in 2024, Gardner was able to land a job helping care for surgical patients at an Iowa hospital - two years after the abuse allegations against him were reported to SafeSport and the police.",
      "And it was not until late May that West Des Moines police executed a search warrant at his home, eventually leading to the recovery of a trove of photos and videos on his computer and cellphone of nude young girls, court records show.",
      "Authorities in Iowa sealed the court documents after the AP asked about the investigation earlier this month, before details of the federal charge were made public Friday. Gardner, Qiao and Gardner's former employer in Mississippi did not respond to AP requests for comment.",
      "\"The job that I've always wanted\"",
      "Chow's Gymnastics is best known as the academy where U.S. gymnasts Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas trained before becoming gold medalists at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.",
      "Qiao opened the gym in 1998 after starring on the Chinese national team and moving to the United States to coach at the University of Iowa. The gym became a draw for top youth gymnasts, with some families moving to Iowa to train there.",
      "Gardner moved to Iowa in September 2018, jumping at the opportunity to coach under Qiao.",
      "\"This is the job that I've always wanted. Chow is really someone I have looked up to since I've been coaching,\" Gardner told the ABC affiliate WOI-TV in 2019. \"And you can tell when you step foot in the gym, just even from coaching the girls, the culture that he's built. It's amazing. It's beautiful.\"",
      "A year later, Gardner was promoted to director of Chow's Winter Classic, an annual meet that draws more than 1,000 gymnasts to Iowa. He also coached a junior Olympics team during his four-year tenure at Chow's.",
      "Several of his students earned college gymnastics scholarships, but Gardner said he had bigger goals.",
      "\"You want to leave a thumbprint on their life, so when they go off hopefully to school, to bigger and better things, that they remember Chow's as family,\" he said in a 2020 interview with WOI-TV.",
      "Coach accused of sexual misconduct in Iowa, Mississippi",
      "Gardner is accused of abusing his position at Chow's and his former job at Jump'In Gymnastics in Mississippi to prey on girls under his tutelage, according to a nine-page FBI affidavit released Friday that summarizes the allegations against him.",
      "A girl reported to SafeSport in March 2022 that Gardner used \"inappropriate spotting techniques\" in which he would put his hands between her legs and touch her vagina, the affidavit said.",
      "It said she alleged Gardner would ask girls if they were sexually active and call them \"idiots, sluts, and whores.\" She said this behavior began after his hiring in 2018 and continued until she left the gym in 2020 and provided the names of six other potential victims.",
      "SafeSport suspended Gardner in July 2022 \u2013 four months after the girl's report \u2013 a provisional step it can take in severe cases with \"sufficient evidentiary support\" as investigations proceed.",
      "A month after that, the center received a report from another girl alleging additional \"sexual contact and physical abuse,\" including that Gardner similarly fondled her during workouts, the FBI affidavit said. The girl said that he once dragged her across the carpet so hard that it burned her buttocks, the affidavit said.",
      "SafeSport shared the reports with West Des Moines police, in line with its policy requiring adults who interact with youth athletes to disclose potential criminal cases to law enforcement.",
      "While SafeSport's suspension took Gardner out of gymnastics, the criminal investigation quickly hit a roadblock.",
      "Police records show a detective told SafeSport to urge the alleged victims to file criminal complaints, but only one of their mothers contacted police in 2022. That woman said her daughter did not want to pursue criminal charges, and police suspended the investigation.",
      "Victims of abuse are often reluctant to cooperate with police, said Ken Lang, a retired detective and associate professor of criminal justice at Milligan University.",
      "\"In this case you have the prestige of this facility,\" he said. \"Do they want to associate their name with that, in that way, when their aspirations were to succeed in gymnastics?\"",
      "Police suspended the investigation, even as Gardner was on probation for his second-offense of driving while intoxicated.",
      "A dormant case reopened, and a year later, an arrest",
      "The case stayed dormant until April 2024 when another former Chow's student came forward to the West Des Moines Police Department to report abuse allegations, according to a now-sealed affidavit signed by police detective Jeff Lyon. The AP is not identifying the student in line with its policy of not naming victims of alleged sexual abuse.",
      "The now 18-year-old told police she began taking lessons from Gardner when she was 11 or 12 in 2019, initially seeing him as a \"father figure\" who tried to help her get through her parents' divorce. He told her she could tell him \"anything,\" the affidavit said.",
      "When she moved in 2021, she told police, he gave her a hug and said she could text and follow him on Instagram and other social media sites, where he went by the nickname \"Coach Seanie,\" because gym policy barring such contact no longer applied.",
      "According to a summary of her statement provided in Lyon's affidavit, she said Gardner fondled her during exercises, repeatedly touching her vagina; rubbed her back and butt and discussed his sex life; and made her do inappropriate stretches that exposed her privates.",
      "She told police she suspected he used his cellphone to film her in that position.",
      "Reached by the AP, the teen's mother declined comment. The mother told police she was interested in a monetary settlement with Chow's because the gym \"had been made aware of the complaints and they did nothing to stop them,\" according to Lyon's affidavit. The gym didn't return AP messages seeking comment.",
      "It took 16 months after the teen's 2024 report for the FBI to arrest Gardner, who made an initial court appearance in Des Moines on Friday on a charge of producing visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, which can carry up to 30 years in prison. A public defender assigned to represent him didn't return AP messages seeking comment.",
      "It's unclear why the case took so long to investigate and also when the FBI, which had to pay $138 million to Nassar's victims for botching that investigation, got involved in the case.",
      "Among evidence seized by investigators in late May were a cellphone, laptop and a desktop computer along with handwritten notes between Gardner and his former pupils, according to the sealed court documents.",
      "They found images of girls, approximately 6 to 14 years in age, who were nude, using the toilet or changing into leotards, those documents show. Those images appear to have come from a hidden camera in a restroom.",
      "They also uncovered 50 video files and 400 photos, including some that appeared to be child pornography, according to the FBI affidavit. One video allegedly shows Gardner entering the bathroom and turning off the camera.",
      "Investigators also found images of an adult woman secretly filmed entering and exiting a bathtub, and identified her as Gardner's ex-girlfriend. That woman as well as the gym's owner, Candi Workman, told investigators the images appeared to come from Jump'In Gymnastics' facility in Purvis, Mississippi, which has since been closed.",
      "SafeSport's power has limits",
      "SafeSport has long touted that it can deliver sanctions in cases where criminal charges are not pursued as key to its mission. However, Gardner's ability to land a job in health care illustrates the limits of that power: It can ban people from sports but that sanction is not guaranteed to reach the general public.",
      "While not commenting about Gardner's case directly, it said in a statement provided to AP that a number of issues factor into why cases can take so long to close, including the 8,000 reports it receives a year with only around 30 full-time investigators. It has revamped some procedures, it said, \u00a0in an attempt to become more efficient.",
      "\"While the Center is able and often does cooperate in law enforcement investigations,\" it said, \"law enforcement is not required to share information, updates, or even confirm an investigation is ongoing.\"",
      "USA Gymnastics President Li Li Leung called the center's task \"really tough, difficult to navigate.\"",
      "\"I would like to see more consistency with their outcomes and sanctions,\" Leung said. \"I would like to see more standardization on things. I would like to see more communication, more transparency from their side.\"",
      "A case that lingers, even after the SafeSport ban",
      "As the investigation proceeded, Gardner said on his Facebook page he had landed a new job in May 2024 as a surgical technologist at MercyOne West Des Moines Medical Center. It's a role that calls for positioning patients on the operating room table, and assisting with procedures and post-surgery care.",
      "Asked about Gardner's employment, hospital spokesman Todd Mizener told the AP: \"The only information I can provide is that he is no longer\" at the hospital.",
      "Meanwhile, the case lingers, leaving lives in limbo more than three years after the SafeSport Center and police first learned of it.",
      "\"SafeSport is now part of a larger problem rather than a solution, if it was ever a solution,\" said attorney Silvey. \"The most fundamental professional task such as coordination with local or federal law enforcement gets botched on a daily basis, hundreds of times a year now.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 07:36:41 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says he plans to sign an executive order \"to end mail-in ballots, because they're corrupt.\" Here's what to know about his claims.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump promised Monday to work to end mail-in voting and said work is already underway on an executive order to ban it before the 2026 midterm elections, although the Constitution does not give him this power.",
      "\"We, as a Republican Party, are going to do everything possible that we get rid of mail-in ballots,\" he said during an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots.\"",
      "Why does Trump want to ban mail-in ballots?",
      "\"Mail-in ballots are corrupt,\" the president said. He suggested the method is susceptible to voter fraud, claiming in California, \"it's so corrupt, where some people get five, six, seven ballots delivered to them.\" He has often insisted mail-in ballots can be tampered with or enable people to vote multiple times.",
      "But soon after the 2020 election, Debra Cleaver, founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan voter information site, dismissed the idea of widespread voter fraud as \"a myth.\"",
      "\"The outgoing ballots have a barcode, and then when you send your ballot in, you put it in a return envelope and that barcode has to match the barcode that was sent out in order for the ballot to be counted,\" she explained to CBS News.",
      "After that election, the director of the nation's cyber security agency, Christopher Krebs, called the 2020 vote \"the most secure in American history.\"",
      "In 2024, when Mr. Trump won the presidential election, the U.S. Census Bureau said nearly a third of ballots nationwide were cast by mail.",
      "The White House told CBS News in a statement that Democrats had \"eroded faith in our elections\" with policies like \"unfettered mail-in voting.\"",
      "\"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Monday night.",
      "Trump's impending executive order to stop mail voting \u2014 would it be legal?",
      "In a social media post earlier in the day, the president said of the impending order that it would \"help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "He claimed that the states \"are merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,\" and that \"[t]hey must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.\"",
      "But Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution says it's the states that have the authority to regulate elections, not the president, and this may be changed only by Congress.",
      "Trump claims U.S. is the only country that uses mail-in voting. Is that true?",
      "Mr. Trump also claimed, \"We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting\" and argued, \"You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in. And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected.\"",
      "In fact, more than 30 other countries allow voting by mail for some or all voters, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an intergovernmental advocacy group based in Sweden. Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany\u00a0and Denmark are among them.",
      "Mail-in voting in the U.S.",
      "In the U.S., mail voting is widespread: 28 states allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot, while the rest require a a documented reason such as illness or military service.",
      "The pandemic gave mail voting a huge boost in the 2020 elections. About 43% of voters cast their ballot by mail that year, according to a report by the Election Assistance Commission. In 2024, mail voting dropped off, representing just over 30% of the total votes cast \u2014 about 46.8 million votes. The commission said that last year's numbers still exceeded pre-pandemic levels.",
      "The topic of mail-in voting came up during Mr. Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, too. After the two met Friday, the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said, 'You can't have an honest election, election with mail-in voting.' And he said, 'There's not a country in the world that uses it now.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two talked about the 2020 election and that Putin told him, \"You won that election by so much, and that's (mail voting) how [Biden] got it.\" Audits and investigations, including some conducted by Trump supporters and Republican secretaries of state, showed no evidence that the 2020 election results were inaccurate.",
      "David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, pointed out in a statement to CBS News that mail-in voting has been around since the Civil War and said getting rid of mail voting \"is an incredibly bad idea that would make our elections much less secure and vulnerable to interference.\"",
      "\"Requiring states to eliminate or replace the voting machines that confirmed the election of this president, just 15 months before a midterm election and less than a year before primaries, is not possible and would result in chaos,\" said Becker, who is also a CBS News election law contributor.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News in a statement Monday night that \"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York.\"",
      "\"Democrats have eroded faith in our elections with reckless laws, such as unfettered mail-in voting, illegally changing laws to benefit their voters, and slow-walking the counting of votes far past Election Day,\" Fields said.",

      "Hurricane Erin was on a path to head north more or less parallel to the East Coast and will probably grow \"substantially\" and bring dangerous rip currents to that coast this week, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said early Tuesday. The hurricane wasn't expected to make landfall over the U.S., but people in North Carolina's Outer Banks were warned of possible coastal flooding. That triggered evacuation orders.",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, weakened back into a Category 3 storm late Monday night as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean north of the Caribbean. It previously\u00a0exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before weakening to a Category 3 early Sunday morning, then regaining strength again later in the day.",
      "As of 5 a.m. EDT Tuesday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 115 mph and was slowing down, moving northwest at 7 mph. The storm's center was about 675 miles southwest of Bermuda and about 750 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.",
      "A\u00a0Category 3 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 111-129 mph and is considered a major storm, capable of causing devastating damage. Hurricanes lose that label when their maximum sustained winds fall below 110 mph.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "The center of the storm was expected to turn to the north on Tuesday and move between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast Wednesday and Thursday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Erin is already a large storm, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 80 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending up to 205 miles from the center, forecasters said.",

A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "A storm surge watch was also issued for the Outer Banks, alerting people to the possibility of life-threatening inundation from coastal flooding starting Wednesday.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north and curves back over the Atlantic.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the U.S. coast while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "How will Hurricane Erin affect the U.S.?",
      "Erin isn't forecast to hit the U.S. directly, but coastal areas along the Eastern Seaboard will feel its effects with dangerous rip currents and high waves of 10 to\u00a0 20+ feet over the next several days.",
      "Mike Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said the dangerous conditions were expected to last for much of the week across almost the entire East Coast. He urged people to heed any warnings from local officials.",
      "\"It's just not going to be a very safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said.",
      "The Outer Banks, in particular, should monitor the progress of Erin, the hurricane center advised, noting that in addition to rip currents, there is a risk of strong winds associated with the outer rainbands during the middle part of the week. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island and\u00a0Ocracoke Island.",
      "Along the Outer Banks, the National Weather Service warned of the potential for severe flooding to reach buildings and roads. Many roadways will likely be under several feet of water and inaccessible for several days due to the flooding.",
      "Rip currents a potentially deadly threat",
      "Rip currents\u00a0are narrow channels of fast-moving water that commonly occur along U.S. coastlines and can pull even strong swimmers away from shore. They're the reason for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of beach rescues.",
      "In addition to the warnings along the North Carolina coast, some beaches farther up the Mid-Atlantic coast are also taking precautions.",
      "Erin is expected to bring dangerous rip currents along the Jersey Shore and south-facing New York beaches on Tuesday,\u00a0CBS News New York reported, with the risk continuing through the week. Officials at some New Jersey beaches and the\u00a0popular summer destination of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, have already prohibited swimming as a precaution, and more closures may follow.",
      "\"You're allowed on the beach, but you will not be allowed in the water because we have treacherous conditions going on right now,\" said Ed Schneider, beach patrol captain in Wildwood, New Jersey, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"We have a rip current warning, we have [a] rough surf warning, we have [a] storm warning, and conditions are bad.\"",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

    "story": [
      "As students savor the last dregs of summer before heading back to school, many families are shopping for supplies earlier this year to get ahead of tariffs.",
      "Over half of U.S. households that earn less than $50,000 a year say they plan to buy only essential school items, while 74% say they are shopping earlier than usual to avoid a potential hit from tariffs,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization that opposes higher import duties.",
      "Many back-to-school essentials, from clothing and footwear to personal electronics, are imported. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0estimates that the U.S. tariff rate on such goods has jumped to an average of 18% this year, more than triple the 5% rate in 2024.",
      "Families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade are projected to spend an average of $858 on clothing, shoes, school supplies and electronics this year, NRF found. That's down slightly from $875 in 2024, as inflation has continued to ease this year, although up sharply from $697 in 2019, the group's data shows.",
      "Record high prices",
      "Recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0shows\u00a0that the cost of school supplies and books is at a record high. A recent analysis from The Century Foundation also found that prices for a typical assortment of school supplies are up more than 7% in price this year, with goods such index cards and binders subject to even steeper price hikes.",
      "School supplies cut across a range of goods categories, from dorm room d\u00e9cor, clothing and personal electronics to staples including writing implements, notebooks and backpacks.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "Although steep new U.S. tariffs haven't delivered the kind of shock to the economy that some forecasters expected, many consumers are worried, shopping expert Trae Bodge told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"All of the studies that I'm seeing are showing that consumers are concerned,\" Bodge said. \"We are seeing prices ticking up because of tariffs, because of inflation. And so people are worried about being able to afford the things they need for school.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge \u2014 rose 2.7% in July on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "How to save",
      "Large retailers are rolling out deep discounts on some school supplies, with items like notebooks, folders, crayons and erasers selling for less than $1.",
      "For big-ticket items, experts urge consumers to compare prices. That includes cross-checking in-store prices against online deals. For example, a $269 Samsung Galaxy tablet at one retailer was available for $220 on its app. Most retailers also will match the best price on their own websites, Bodge noted.",
      "When it comes to personal electronics, many of which are imported and now subject to President Trump's wide-reaching tariffs, Bodge urges consumers to consider buying refurbished models.",
      "\"A lot of retailers offer refurbished items that also come with a warranty, and that's a really good option if you're looking to save,\" she said.",
      "When it comes to products like pencils and notebooks, buying a store-brand over a name-brand also often offers savings. For clothes, experts advise waiting until school starts \u2014 when kids ask for whatever is trendy, you'll have a little money left over.",
      "Another way to both manage your budget while imparting a lesson on spending is to give teens a gift card, Bodge said. \"So they will be much more careful spending their money versus your money. And they'll stay on budget by doing this,\" she told CBS News.",

      "The Texas House of Representatives gaveled in at noon Monday with Democratic members present, marking an official end to the quorum break that froze the Legislature for two weeks.",
      "Most of the House Democratic Caucus left the state earlier this month, denying the Republican majority the required attendance to conduct business. House rules require 100 members to be present; Republicans hold 88 seats.",
      "The Democratic quorum break was triggered by a Republican push to redraw the state's U.S. House district maps that would net the GOP up to five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Last week, the absent lawmakers had signaled they were ready to return to Austin after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ended a first special session and Democrats in California moved forward with a plan to respond.",
      "\"Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire legislators across the country how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses,\" state Rep. Gene Wu, the Democratic leader, said in a statement issued Monday morning.",
      "As the House returned to business, the redistricting proposal and dozens of other bills were referred to their respective committees. The redistricting committee met Monday night and passed the maps along party lines. The Senate's redistricting committee passed the proposed maps along party lines on Sunday evening.",

      "It is unusual for redistricting to take place in the middle of the decade and typically occurs once at the beginning of each decade to coincide with the census.",
      "In response to the efforts in Texas, California Democrats are also moving ahead with their own reshaping of congressional districts to counteract Texas, putting in motion a potentially widening and unusually timed redistricting battle nationwide.",

      "Impact on midterm elections",
      "On a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total House seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.",
      "Texas' maps would aim to give the GOP five more winnable seats.",
      "California Democrats, who hold supermajorities in both chambers \u2014 enough to act without any Republican votes \u2014 on Friday unveiled a proposal that could give Democrats there an additional five U.S. House seats. But any changes would first need the approval of state lawmakers and voters. Democratic California Gov.

    "summary": "More than 550 pages of investigation documents were released by Idaho State Police in response to public records requests.",
    "story": [
      "Bryan Kohberger developed a reputation for being \"sexist\" and \"creepy\" while attending a criminal justice program in the months before he killed four University of Idaho students in 2022, fellow grad students told investigators.",
      "More than 550 pages of investigation documents were recently released by Idaho State Police in response to public records requests. They include summaries of interviews with students and instructors at Washington State University, where Kohberger was a doctoral student in criminology.",
      "Kohberger's behavior was so problematic that one Washington State University faculty member told co-workers that if he ever became a professor, he would likely stalk or sexually abuse his future students, according to the documents. She urged her co-workers to cut Kohberger's funding to remove him from the program.",
      "\"He is smart enough that in four years we will have to give him a Ph.D.,\" the woman told her colleagues, according to the report from Idaho State Police Detective Ryan O'Harra. She continued, \"Mark my word, I work with predators, if we give him a Ph.D., that's the guy that in that many years when he is a professor, we will hear is harassing, stalking, and sexually abusing ... his students at wherever university.\"",
      "Kohberger was sentenced to life in prison without parole last month for the stabbing murders of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin at a rental home near the Moscow, Idaho, campus early on Nov. 13, 2022.",
      "The WSU faculty member told investigators that Kohberger would sometimes go into an office where several female grad students worked, physically blocking the door. Sometimes, she would hear one of the women say, \"I really need to get out of here,\" so she would intercede by going into the office to allow the student to leave.",
      "The faculty member believed Kohberger was stalking people. She told police that someone had reportedly broken into a female graduate student's apartment in September or October, stealing perfume and underwear.",
      "An unnamed Ph.D. student who was in the same program as Kohberger told police that he enjoyed conflict, was disparaging toward women and that he especially liked to talk about sexual burglary \u2014 his field of study.",
      "About three weeks after the murders, Kohberger told the Ph.D. student that whoever had committed the crimes \"must have been pretty good,\" Idaho State Police Detective Sgt. Michael Van Leuven wrote in a report. Kohberger also told the woman that the murders might have been a \"one and done type thing,\" Van Leuven wrote.",
      "The woman \"said she had never met anyone who acted in such a condescending manner and wondered why people in power in the department did not address his behavior,\" Van Leuven wrote. \"The way he spoke to females in the department was unsettling to them.\"",
      "One instructor told police that she was assigned to work with Kohberger on his doctoral program. In late August 2022, she said she began receiving complaints about him from students and staff in the criminal justice program.",
      "The instructor told police that she spent \"a lot of time\" speaking about Kohberger during disciplinary meetings.",
      "\"The meetings focused around Kohberger's interactions with fellow post-graduate students, in and out of the classroom, along with his behavior around some of the criminal justice professors,\" according to an investigator's report.",
      "The school got nine separate complaints from faculty members, administration staffers and other students about his \"rude and belittling behavior toward women,\" Idaho State Police Detective Sean Prosser wrote in a report. In response, the school held a mandatory training class for all graduate students about behavior expectations.",
      "Many of Kohberger's fellow students and instructors at WSU did not suspect his involvement in the killings, according to the police reports. But at least one fellow student noticed his behavior changed after the murders.",
      "The student said Kohberger frequently used his phone before the killings, but stopped bringing his cellphone to class after the murders. He also appeared more disheveled in the weeks after the killings, the student told police, and she thought it was odd that he never participated in conversations about the Moscow deaths.",
      "She eventually called a police tip line to report that she had seen Kohberger with bloody knuckles just prior to the killings and his hand looked like he had been hitting something.",
      "Cellmates said Kohberger used 3 bars of soap a week and excessively washed his hands",
      "Cellmates who were lodged with Kohberger in the Latah County Sheriff's Office jail in Moscow after his arrest said he loved watching the news coverage about him.",
      "According to one cellmate, Kohberger said, \"Wow, I'm on every channel.\" Another cellmate told police that Kohberger enjoyed watching the news about his case unless it began talking about his family or friends, at which point he'd change the channel immediately. But as time went on, that cellmate said, he stopped watching the news related to his case almost completely.",
      "Kohberger went through three standard-size bars of soap a week, both cellmates told police, took hourlong showers and excessively washed his hands, which were red from the amount of hand washing he did.",
      "He also wanted new bedding and clothes every day, the second cellmate told police.",

The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "City officials and community activists pointed to the killing as a symbol of the dangers of gun violence in Memphis, where more than 300 homicides were reported that year.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed the killing as part an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, Yo Gotti.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Testifying against Govan on Monday was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the\u00a0two shooters\u00a0who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against\u00a0Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter. Smith had previously testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph, as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date. Johnson was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in September 2024.\u00a0He was later sentenced\u00a0for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "Smith testified on Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the volunteer event, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said that Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Young Dolph began his career by releasing numerous mixtapes. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, \"King of Memphis.\" He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others. Young Dolph had three albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, with 2020\u2032s \"Rich Slave\" peaking at No. 4.",
      "He was among the musical stars that The Grammy Awards paid tribute to during its memoriam segment at the 2022 awards.",
      "In a\u00a02024 interview with The Associated Press, Carlisa Brown, Young Dolph's sister, called her brother's killing a \"very senseless murder\" and added that his family wants everyone involved to get the justice they deserve.",
      "The attack that killed the rapper wasn't the first time he was targeted. In 2017, Young Dolph was approached by three men and shot over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. He was critically injured but survived. Earlier that same year, he was involved in another shooting, where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",

      "At least five Republican-led states have moved to deploy members of their National Guard forces to the nation's capital as part of the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in Washington, D.C., through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness.",
      "The governors of Mississippi and Louisiana\u00a0on Monday announced they would be sending 200 and 135 Guard troops, respectively. On Saturday, West Virginia said it was deploying between 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio said it would send 150 in the coming days.",
      "Tennessee has also provided 160 Guard troops, according to The Associated Press. The Tennessee National Guard has been deployed \"to assist with monument security, community safety patrols, protecting federal facilities, and traffic control,\" a spokesperson for Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee told AP.",
      "The move comes as federal agents and National Guard troops have begun to appear across the heavily Democratic city after President Trump's executive order last week, federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 D.C. National Guard troops.",
      "West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Saturday that he was sending a contingent of 300 to 400 Guard troops to Washington, while South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said his state would send 150 military police at the request of the Defense Department.",
      "\"West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital,\" Morrisey said.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry wrote Monday on social media: \"I am proud to support this mission to return safety and sanity to Washington DC and cities all across our country, including right here in Louisiana.\"",
      "Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves wrote on X that \"crime is out of control\" in Washington, D.C., adding: \"I know the brave men and women of our National Guard will do an excellent job enhancing public safety and supporting law enforcement.\"",
      "Maj. Gen. James Seward, West Virginia's adjutant general, said in a statement that members of the state's National Guard \"stand ready to support our partners in the National Capital Region,\" and that the troops' \"unique capabilities and preparedness make it an invaluable partner in this important undertaking.\"",
      "Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican from Vermont, declined on Friday to send the state's National Guard troops to the nation's capital. Scott's chief of staff, Jason Gibbs, told Vermont Public that while public safety is a \"legitimate concern\" in cities across the country, \"the governor just does not support utilizing the guard for this purpose, and does not view the enforcement of domestic law as proper use of the National Guard.\"",
      "The activations suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers.",
      "By adding outside troops to join the existing National Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers temporarily assigned to Washington, Mr. Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though district officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.",
      "A White House official\u00a0told CBS News on Saturday that National Guard members deployed to D.C. \"may be armed,\" but that they would not make arrests. This was a reversal from earlier in the week, when a Defense Department official told CBS News that deployed Guard members would not be armed at the request of local law enforcement partners. The official also said at the time they would not have weapons in their vehicles.",
      "\"The National Guard is not making arrests at this time \u2013 they may be armed, consistent with their mission and training, to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence,\" the White House official said Saturday.",
      "A protest against Mr. Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday afternoon before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said \"No fascist takeover of D.C.,\" and some in the crowd held signs that said \"No military occupation.\" Mr. Trump was at his Virginia golf club after Friday's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.",
      "Federal agents have appeared in some of the city's most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country.",
      "City leaders, who are obliged to cooperate with the president's order under the federal laws that direct the district's local governance, have sought to work with the administration, though they have bristled at the scope of the president's takeover.",
      "On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an \"emergency police commissioner\" after the district's top lawyer sued to contest. After Friday's court hearing, Attorney General Pam Bond issued a memo that directed the Metropolitan Police Department to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law.",
      "District officials say they are evaluating how to best comply.",
      "In his order last week, Mr. Trump declared an emergency due to the \"city government's failure to maintain public order.\" He said that impeded the \"federal government's ability to operate efficiently to address the nation's broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.\"",
      "In a letter to city residents, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, wrote that \"our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.\" She added that if Washingtonians stick together, \"we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy \u2014 even when we don't have full access to it.\"",

      "When is Labor Day?",
      "This year, Labor Day falls on Monday, Sept.1.",
      "What is the history of Labor Day?",
      "Nowadays, Labor Day is more commonly associated with barbecues and beach days, but the federal holiday was created to celebrate the hard-won rights of American workers.",
      "Before early labor laws came into play in the 20th century, the average U.S. worker's schedule spanned 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, with low wages and little protections, according to\u00a0History.com.",
      "The culmination of years of strikes and protests by American workers to secure better job conditions, Labor Day was signed into law on June 28, 1894, by President Grover Cleveland.",
      "The civilian workforce in America is around 170 million people strong as of June 2025, data from Statista shows. While there's no cap on the number of hours Americans can work per week, federal law mandates that workers be paid a minimum wage.",
      "That wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. However, many cities and states across the country have passed legislation to enforce higher minimums adjusted for today's cost of living. Most recently in July, the minimum wage was raised in 15 states and cities.",

    "story": [
      "Wages still haven't caught up with inflation, four years after the pandemic caused prices to soar and created a cost-of-living crisis for many households, a new study finds.",
      "Americans on average are earning 1.2 percentage points below the rise in the cost of living over the past four years, which means that the typical worker's pay increases over that time haven't yet caught up to higher prices, according to Bankrate's 2025 Wage to Inflation Index.",
      "The findings come as Americans remain sour about the economy, with 55% rating it as either very or fairly bad, according to a July poll from CBS News. Three-quarters said their incomes haven't kept up with inflation, while a majority also said they've seen prices creep higher in recent weeks and also expect that to continue.",
      "But some professions are falling further behind than others, with educators seeing the biggest gap between income growth and inflation during the past four years, the study found. Teachers have long struggled with a \"wage gap,\" meaning that they typically earn less than college graduates working in other fields, due to issues such as constraints on school funding,\u00a0according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"Wage growth is often a reflection of who has the power in the labor market,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If there are more job openings than workers to fill them, businesses will often lift pay to retain or attract talent.\"",
      "She added, \"On the flip side, if there are too few job openings, companies don't have to work as hard to keep workers because they have nowhere to really go.\"",
      "Overall, the 1.2 percentage point gap between the typical workers' pay growth and inflation during the past four years signals that many households are continuing to feel financial strain, Foster added. Even before the pandemic, millions of Americans were\u00a0struggling to save for emergencies.",
      "\"Wages not keeping up with inflation translate to outright purchasing-power destruction,\" Foster said. \"These are funds that households could be using to stash away for their goals, like saving for retirement and a home, or building up their safety nets and emergency fund.\"",
      "The professions that have outpaced inflation include those that saw a spike in demand after the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality workers, she added. \"Health care, meanwhile, is driving job growth lately, accounting for 88% of private-sector payroll growth last month,\" Foster said.",
      "Wage dissatisfaction",
      "Only about 54% of Americans say they are satisfied with their current wages, according to a new analysis from Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That represents the lowest satisfaction level since the NY Fed began tracking the measure in 2014.",
      "Even high-income households, which contribute about\u00a0half of all consumer spending\u00a0and drive economic growth, are facing bigger financial hurdles, including surging delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans, according to recent research.",
      "For instance, the share of all new jobs that pay above-average wages has fallen to 7% this year, down from 38% prior to 2020, according to credit-scoring company VantageScore. That can make it tougher for professionals to find new jobs if they suffer a job loss, the group noted.",
      "Workers in white-collar industries like finance and business services \"speak of a frozen job market,\" Foster noted. \"Employed workers in the sector can't find anywhere else to go and unemployed workers struggle to find new work.\"",

      "Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren't in the air.",

The suit against Newsmax was brought by Dominion Voting Systems, which alleged the network published false and defamatory statements claiming the company rigged the election. A Delaware judge ruled partially in favor of Dominion in a decision earlier this year, additional court filings show.",
      "The settlement comes after Fox News Channel paid $787.5 million\u00a0to settle a similar lawsuit in 2023 and Newsmax paid what court papers describe as $40 million to settle a libel lawsuit from a different voting machine manufacturer, Smartmatic, which also was a target of pro-Trump conspiracy theories on the network.",
      "Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis had ruled earlier that Newsmax did indeed defame Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems by airing false information about the company and its equipment. But Davis left it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages. Newsmax and Dominion reached a settlement before the trial could take place.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Monday, a Dominion spokesperson said the company was \"pleased to have settled this matter.\"",
      "The settlement originally came to light in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Newsmax, which was dated Friday, Aug. 15, the day that a deal was reached, according to the document. Newsmax has agreed to pay the settlement in three installments of $27 million, $20 million and $20 million, with the final installment to be paid in January 2027, the filing said.",
      "Newsmax continues to deny allegations that suggest its coverage of Dominion in the context of the 2020 election was defamatory.",
      "\"Newsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020,\" the company said in a statement published on its website. \"We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\"",
      "The disclosure of the settlement came as Mr. Trump, who lost his 2020 reelection bid to former President Joe Biden, vowed in a social media post Monday to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines, such as those supplied by Dominion and other companies, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. It was unclear how the Republican president could achieve that.",
      "\"I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we're at it, Highly 'Inaccurate,' Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election,\" Mr. Trump wrote in the post.",
      "The same judge also handled the Dominion-Fox News case and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Mr. Trump's allies about his 2020 loss, despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were bogus. At the time, Davis found it was \"CRYSTAL clear\" that none of the allegations was true.",
      "Internal correspondence from Newsmax officials likewise shows they knew the claims were baseless.",
      "\"How long are we going to play along with election fraud?\" Newsmax host Bob Sellers said two days after the 2020 election was called for Biden, according to internal documents revealed as part of the case.",
      "Newsmax took pride that it was not calling the election for Biden, and internal documents show it saw a business opportunity in catering to viewers who believed Mr. Trump won. Private communications that surfaced as part of Dominion's earlier defamation case against Fox News also revealed how the network's business interests intersected with decisions it made related to coverage of Mr. Trump's 2020 election claims.",
      "At Newsmax, employees repeatedly warned against false allegations from pro-Trump guests such as attorney Sidney Powell, according to documents in the lawsuit. In one text, even Newsmax owner Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally, said he found it \"scary\" that Mr. Trump was meeting with Powell.",
      "Dominion was at the heart of many of the wild claims aired by guests on Newsmax and elsewhere, who promoted a conspiracy theory involving deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to rig the machines for Biden. The network retracted some of the more bombastic allegations in December 2020.",
      "Though Mr. Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there's no evidence they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president's biggest supporters knew they were false at the time. Mr. Trump's then-attorney general, William Barr, said there was no evidence of widespread fraud.",
      "Mr. Trump and his backers lost dozens of lawsuits alleging fraud, some before Trump-appointed judges. Numerous recounts, reviews and audits of the election results, including some run by Republicans, turned up no signs of significant wrongdoing or error and affirmed Biden's win.",
      "After returning to office, Mr. Trump pardoned those who tried to halt the transfer of power during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and directed his Department of Justice to investigate Chris Krebs, a former Trump cybersecurity appointee who had vouched for the security and accuracy of the 2020 election.",
      "As an initial trial date approached in the Dominion case earlier this year, Mr. Trump issued an executive order attacking the law firm that litigated it and the Fox case, Susman Godfrey. The order, part of a series targeting law firms that Mr. Trump has tussled with, cited Susman Godfrey's work on elections and said the government would not do business with any of its clients or permit any of its staff in federal buildings.",
      "A federal judge put that action on hold, saying the framers would view it as \"a shocking abuse of power.\"",

      "Toronto \u2014 Air Canada said Tuesday it will restart operations gradually after a tentative agreement was reached with the union for 10,000 flight attendants to end a strike that disrupted the travel plans of hundreds of thousands of passengers.",
      "The Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, made the announcement\u00a0on its Facebook page\u00a0early Tuesday.",
      "It came after the union and Air Canada resumed talks late Monday for the first time since the strike began over the weekend. The walkout affected about 130,000 travelers a day at the peak of the summer travel season.",
      "Canada's largest airline said flights will start resuming Tuesday evening.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday after turning down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "The union said the agreement will guarantee members pay for work performed while planes are on the ground, resolving one of the major issues that drove the strike.",
      "\"Unpaid work is over. We have reclaimed our voice and our power,\" the union said in a statement. \"When our rights were taken away, we stood strong, we fought back - and we secured a tentative agreement that our members can vote on.\"",

      "\"Full restoration may require a week or more, so we ask for our customers' patience and understanding over the coming days,\" Rousseau said in a statement.",
      "The two sides reached the deal with the help of a mediator early Tuesday morning. The airline said mediation discussions \"were begun on the basis that the union commit to have the airline's 10,000 flight attendants immediately return to work.\" Air Canada declined to comment further on the agreement until the ratification process is complete. It noted a strike or lockout is not possible during this time.",
      "The union said it is \"required to advise our membership that we must fully cooperate with resumption of operations,\" adding that the talks that settled the strike began at 7 p.m. Monday lasted until 4:23 a.m. Tuesday",

      "The Canada Industrial Relations Board had declared the strike illegal Monday and ordered the flight attendants back on the job. But the union said it would defy the directive.

      "The board is an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada's labor laws. The government ordered the board to intervene.",
      "Labor leaders objected to the Canadian government's repeated use of a law that cuts off workers' right to strike and forces them into arbitration, a step the government took in recent years with workers at ports, railways and elsewhere.",

      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, weakened back into a Category 3 storm late Monday night as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean north of the Caribbean. It previously\u00a0exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before weakening to a Category 3 early Sunday morning, then regaining strength again later in the day.",

      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect for Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas, the hurricane center said. Tropical storm watches were issued for the central Bahamas and North Carolina's Outer Banks.

Mandatory evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island and\u00a0Ocracoke Island.",

      "Officers later found a 74-year-old woman unresponsive on board a separate commercial ship.

Air Canada suspended plans to restart operations Sunday after the union defied an earlier return-to-work order.",
      "\"The members of the union's bargaining unit are directed to resume the performance of their duties immediately and to refrain from engaging in unlawful strike activities,\" the Canada Industrial Relations Board board, or CIRB, said in a written decision.",
      "The board, an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada's labor laws, said the union needs to provide written notice to all of its members by noon Monday that they must resume their duties.",

Air Canada then said it planned to resume flights Sunday evening. But when the workers refused, the airline said it would resume flights Monday evening instead. However, there was no sign that the Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, would relent.",

      "Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. Eastern Time on Saturday after turning down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren't in the air.",
      "The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years. That deal \"would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada,\" according to the carrier.",
      "But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.",
      "\"Air Canada's intended restart of Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge, which have been grounded since Aug. 16 by CUPE's labour disruption, was prevented on Aug. 17 by the CUPE leadership's unlawful strike activities,\" Air Canada said in a statement on Monday. \"Air Canada regrets this impact on its customers and is fully committed to returning to service as soon as possible.\"",

      "Mr. Trump announced the meeting early Saturday, following his\u00a0summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. In a post on Truth Social, the president said the meeting with Putin \"went very well,\" adding that the same was true of a phone call with Zelenskyy and various European leaders after the fact.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy will be coming to D.C., the Oval Office, on Monday afternoon,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.\"",
      "European and NATO leaders are expected to accompany Zelenskyy to Washington, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said she was joining at \"the request of President Zelenskyy.\"",
      "Though the nearly three-hour-long meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents on Friday failed to produce the ceasefire that Mr. Trump had sought, the administration has since pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to get there.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said, noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "The secretary of state, who attended Friday's summit meeting with Putin, indicated that enough progress was made to sit down with Zelenskyy to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "Rubio said the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories and the issue of rebuilding the country still need to be discussed and \"require some more specificity.\"",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer \"game-changing\" security guarantees, including a possible arrangement in which the allies provide \"Article 5-like protection\" to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member nation is considered an attack against all. Putin has been vehemently opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, but a similar security guarantee outside the framework of the alliance might reassure Kyiv that Russia would be deterred from attacking in the future.",
      "Witkoff noted that the administration intends to discuss a possible land swap at Monday's meeting.",
      "\"We're not waiting a week for a meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders,\" Witkoff said. \"We are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, very, very quickly. Quicker than a ceasefire.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post Sunday night, Mr. Trump said, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.

    "story": [
      "A Hong Kong court heard final arguments Monday in the landmark national security trial of former pro-democracy newspaper founder Jimmy Lai, who could be sentenced to up to life in prison if he is convicted.",
      "Lai, 77, was arrested in 2020 under a national security law imposed by Beijing following anti-government protests in 2019. He is being tried on charges of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications.",
      "Lai founded Apple Daily, one of the local media outlets that was most critical of Hong Kong's government. His high-profile case has stretched nearly 150 days, almost double the original estimate, and is widely seen as a trial of press freedom and a test for judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.",
      "It is unclear when a verdict will be delivered, and closing arguments in the trial were expected to last about eight days, CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "Prosecutor Anthony Chau said on Monday that Lai was arrested for collusion in August 2020, but he continued to make requests for sanctions, a blockade or other hostile activities in the following months.",
      "Chau suggested that the appeals for foreign actions did not only target individuals, but also China, while the foreign collaborations Lai had were long-term and persistent.",
      "A prosecution document shown in court argued that the law doesn't prohibit normal international exchanges. But how Lai attempted to draw an analogy of what he did to the cooperation between Hong Kong's prosecuting authority and the International Association of Prosecutors was bewildering.",
      "\"It is surprising to see that D1 (Lai) raised freedoms of thought and association as his shield,\" it said in the document.",
      "Chau is expected to wrap up his closing statement Tuesday.",
      "Earlier, prosecutors alleged Lai asked foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing \"under the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.\"",
      "On the first day of his testimony, Lai denied he had asked then-Vice President Mike Pence and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to take action against Hong Kong and China during the 2019 protests.",
      "When Lai's lawyer questioned him about an Apple Daily report saying he had asked the U.S. government to sanction Beijing and Hong Kong leaders, he said he must have discussed it with Pompeo, as he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the report by the now-defunct newspaper he founded.",
      "But Lai said he would not have encouraged foreign sanctions after the national security law was enacted on June 30, 2020.",
      "Closing arguments have been delayed twice, first due to the weather then to concerns over Lai's health.",
      "On Friday, his lawyer, Robert Pang, said Lai had experienced heart palpitations while in prison. The judges wanted him to secure a heart monitor and medication first.",
      "After Friday's hearing, the Hong Kong government alleged foreign media outlets had attempted to mislead the public about Lai's medical care. It said a medical examination of Lai found no abnormalities and that the medical care he received in custody was adequate.",
      "When Lai entered the courtroom on Monday, he waved and smiled to those sitting in the public gallery and briefly instructed his legal team in a voice audible to public attendees. He closed his eyes at times when the prosecution laid out its legal arguments.",
      "The heart monitor was delivered to Lai and he had no complaints about his health, Chau said.",
      "Lai's yearslong detention in solidarity confinement has drawn concerns from foreign governments and rights groups. President Trump, before being elected to his second term in November, said he would talk to Chinese leader Xi Jinping to seek Lai's release. \"I will get him out,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In a Fox News radio interview released Aug. 14, Mr. Trump denied saying he would save Lai, but rather that he would bring the issue up.",
      "\"I've already brought it up, and I'm going to do everything I can to save him,\" he said.",
      "China has accused Lai of stirring a rise in anti-China sentiments in Hong Kong and said it firmly opposes the interference of other countries in its internal affairs.",
      "Dozens of people waited in the rain Monday for a seat in the main courtroom to see Lai.",
      "Former Apple Daily reader Susan Li said she worried about Lai's health as he looked visibly thinner and she would continue to pray for him. \"I wanted to let him know we are still here,\" she said.",
      "When Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to China in 1997, Beijing promised to retain the city's civil liberties for 50 years. But critics say the promise has become threadbare after the introduction of the security law, which Chinese and Hong Kong authorities insist was necessary for the city's stability.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.",
      "\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called it \"game-changing.\"",
      "Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.",
      "Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.",
      "Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not \"go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.\"",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. \"We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' \u2014 including the European Union \u2014 is ready to do its share,\" she said.",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but said much was unclear.",
      "\"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said, \"But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees.\"",
      "Witkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.",
      "\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"",
      "Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.",
      "\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"",
      "Rubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"",
      "\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,\" Rubio said. \"That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday wrote on social media, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.

      "Honig continued, \"As far as the Sweeney ads being too sexual or aimed at \u2018male gazing,\u2019 I would point to the highly successful Pepsi ad campaign with Cindy Crawford, which was recently rebooted.

In June, researchers discovered a healthcare data breach that exposed the personal information of around 8 million patients. All of this information was publicly accessible online without any passwords or authentication protocols.",
      "The latest healthcare organization to fall victim to a breach is DaVita, which has put nearly a million people at risk. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DaVita provides dialysis treatment to about 200,000 patients across the U.S. and 13 other countries.",

      "Kidney dialysis giant DaVita says nearly 916,000 people had personal and medical information exposed in an April ransomware attack (via Comparitech). The breach, which the company disclosed in state filings, compromised names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance details, medical records, tax ID numbers, addresses and even images of checks made out to the company.",
      "DaVita says the incident disrupted internal operations and primarily affected its laboratories. In its latest notice to victims, the company says the cyberattack began March 24, 2025, and continued until April 12. It has not confirmed whether a ransom was paid.",
      "Ransomware gang Interlock claimed responsibility on April 25, posting screenshots of alleged stolen documents and saying it took 1.5TB of DaVita's data. The group lists the company on its public leak site, where it pressures victims by threatening to sell or release stolen files.",

      "DaVita is offering free identity theft and credit monitoring services to those affected by the breach. But even if you weren't a victim of this specific breach, it's still smart to protect yourself.",
      "Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",

      "The investigation into the DaVita breach is ongoing, and the company has not disclosed how the hackers got in. Nearly a million people now face the possibility of their personal information being used for malicious purposes. Ransomware attacks on hospitals and clinics can lock critical systems, delay care and push providers back to paper records.

      "Cigarette butts are the most littered item on the planet. People toss out an estimated 4.5 trillion cigarette butts each year, and that number may double by the end of 2025 as e-cigarette use grows. These small, toxic waste items pollute city streets, beaches and waterways. They also take years to break down.",

      "A littered cigarette butt on an asphalt road\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why cigarette butts make a good asphalt additive",
      "Modern road construction often relies on additives to improve the strength and flexibility of asphalt. Some road-building materials already use cellulose fibers like those found in cigarette filters. That sparked the idea to take used butts, clean them up and put them to work.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "E-cigarette filters are especially promising. They are longer and packed with fibers like cellulose and polylactic acid (PLA) fibers, making them ideal for reinforcing asphalt.",
      "Person holding cigarette butt in hand \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How cigarette butts are recycled into road material",
      "The recycling process involves several steps:",
      "1. Collecting and sorting: Filters from traditional and e-cigarettes go through a collection and cleaning process. Ash and residue are removed, leaving behind usable fiber material.",
      "2. Shredding and mixing: Machines shred the cleaned fibers and combine them with synthetic hydrocarbon wax, which serves as a binder.",
      "3. Pellet formation: The blended material is pressed, heated and cut into small pellets that can be easily stored and transported.",
      "4. Asphalt integration: These pellets are added to reclaimed asphalt and bitumen. During heating, the pellets melt and release reinforcing fibers that strengthen the final asphalt mix.",
      "Up to 40% of the final road material can come from these recycled components.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Stronger roads and a cleaner planet thanks to cigarette butt recycling",
      "Recycled cigarette butts make asphalt stronger, more flexible and longer-lasting. The fibers released during mixing act as micro reinforcement, improving fatigue resistance and helping roads withstand heavy traffic and temperature changes. The wax in the pellets lowers the temperature needed to mix asphalt, reducing both energy use and emissions during production. Beyond performance, this method gives cigarette waste a second life. By repurposing billions of discarded filters, cities can reduce litter and pollution while building more sustainable infrastructure.",
      "Illustration of a traditional roadway surface (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What cities are doing next with recycled cigarette butts",
      "This technique is still emerging, but interest is growing worldwide. In Bratislava, Slovakia, city officials have already started collecting cigarette butts specifically for road construction. One road built with this recycled asphalt is already in use, setting an example for other cities to follow.",
      "As more pilot projects roll out and awareness spreads, cigarette butts could shift from toxic litter to a valuable resource in sustainable infrastructure.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Recycling cigarette butts into asphalt solves two problems at once. It clears toxic waste from public spaces and makes roads that last longer. This approach turns one of the world\u2019s most common pollutants into a valuable construction material. As more cities explore cleaner, smarter infrastructure, this kind of solution could play a big role in the future of street design.",

      "How Gemini summaries can be hacked",
      "Researchers at Mozilla's 0Din have discovered a vulnerability in Google's Gemini for Workspace that allows attackers to inject hidden instructions into email summaries. The issue, demonstrated by Marco Figueroa, shows how generative AI tools can be misled through indirect prompt injection. This technique embeds invisible commands inside the body of an email. When Gemini summarizes the message, it interprets and acts on those hidden prompts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The attack does not rely on suspicious links or attachments. Instead, it uses a combination of HTML and CSS to conceal the prompt by setting the font size to zero and the color to white. These commands remain invisible in Gmail's standard view but are still accessible to Gemini. Once you request a summary, the AI can be tricked into presenting fake security alerts or urgent instructions that appear to come from Google.",
      "In a proof of concept, Gemini falsely warned a user that a Gmail password had been compromised and included a fake support phone number. Since Gemini summaries are integrated into Google Workspace, you are more likely to trust the information, making this tactic especially effective.",

      "In a statement, a Google spokesperson said, \"Defending against attacks impacting the industry, like prompt injections, has been a continued priority for us, and we've deployed numerous strong defenses to keep users safe, including safeguards to prevent harmful or misleading responses. We are constantly hardening our already robust defenses through red-teaming exercises that train our models to defend against these types of adversarial attacks.\"",

      "So, how can you protect yourself from phishing scams that exploit AI tools like Gemini? Here are six essential steps you can take right now to stay safe:",
      "Just because a summary appears in Gmail or Docs does not mean it is automatically safe. Treat AI-generated suggestions, alerts or links with the same caution you would any unsolicited message. Always verify critical information, such as security alerts or phone numbers, through official sources.",
      "If an email seems unusual, especially if it is unexpected or from someone you do not recognize, avoid using the AI summary feature. Instead, read the full email as it was originally written. This lowers the chance of falling for misleading summaries.",
      "Watch for emails or messages that create a sense of urgency, ask you to verify account details or provide unexpected links or contact information, even if they appear trustworthy or come from familiar sources. Attackers can use AI to craft realistic-looking alerts or requests for sensitive information, sometimes concealed within automatically generated summaries. So, always pause and scrutinize suspicious prompts before responding.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Ensure that Google Workspace and your browser are always running the latest version. Google regularly releases security updates that help prevent newer types of attacks. Also, avoid using unofficial extensions that have access to your Gmail or Docs.",
      "AI-driven scams like the Gemini summary attack don't happen in a vacuum. They often begin with stolen personal information. That data might come from past breaches, public records or details you've unknowingly shared online. A data removal service can help by continuously scanning and requesting the removal of your information from data broker sites. While no service can wipe everything, reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for attackers to personalize phishing attempts or link you to known breach data. Think of it as one more layer of protection in a world where AI makes targeted scams even easier.",

Once inside, the AirTag becomes invisible and unnoticeable to the child wearing the shoes. From there, all tracking happens through Apple's Find My app, which works on any iPhone. It updates the tag's location as long as it remains near an Apple device. Since AirTags were made to track objects like keys and bags, slipping one into a shoe was just a matter of time.",

Plus, they're machine washable, which saves parents time and effort. The standout feature is the hidden AirTag-compatible compartment tucked beneath the heel of the insole. It comes with a screw-tight cover that keeps the tracker secure and discreet. There's no external AirTag branding, so the shoes look like any regular pair of Skechers. With a breathable mesh and synthetic upper, durable rubber outsole, and 1 1/4-inch heel height, the design delivers both style and function.

It's less intrusive than giving them a phone and more flexible than a built-in GPS system. You control the tracker, you install the battery, and you decide who gets access.

But now the Stimson Center\u2019s 38 North, a publication analyzing data on North Korea, says broadcasts into the country from the South, including broadcasts previously backed by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, have been cut back by almost 80% since May, and they advise that level could fall even further over the coming months.",
      "Kim Jong Un depicted riding a horse atop Mount Paektu, a sacred site in North Korea.\u00a0 (KCNA)",
      "It\u2019s also reported that it is more difficult to hear the Christian message now. Because there are fewer broadcasts still going into the North, authorities are said to be having greater success\u00a0in electronically jamming them.",
      "A U.S. State Department spokesperson expressed concern, telling Fox News Digital, \"Under the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Rubio, the State Department Office of International Religious Freedom is actively looking into new ways to advance freedom of religion\u00a0around the world, including in North Korea, and for North Korea\u2019s severely persecuted Christian community. President Trump is a champion for religious freedom globally, including defending people\u2019s ability to read the Bible and freely access religious texts.\"",
      "It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of these broadcasts to Christians in North Korea, Timothy Cho, who defected from the country when he was 17, told Fox News Digital from London. Cho serves on the Secretariat of the British government\u2019s All-Party Parliamentary Group on North Korea, saying \"we are sharing the Gospel with our brothers and sisters on the ground in North Korea. This significance we cannot compare with any amount of values, because it is hope. It is hope, and it is light and it is the message they can rely on during the darkest time inside North Korea.\"",

He explained that\u2019s why Christianity is so feared by the government. He added that \"the most dangerous threat to North Korean authority is the claim of there being a true God who is not connected to the Kim dynasty.\"",
      "\"Underground Christianity provides a space for the free exchange of ideas. Christianity is a defining feature of the DNA of the Korean people,\" Greg Scarlatiou, President and CEO of the Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told Fox News Digital. \"The Kim family regime wants none of that, having tried so hard to obliterate the true identity of the Korean people.\"",
      "\"The shutting down of radio stations beaming information into North Korea is a catastrophic strategic mistake. True change can't come from the Kim family. It can only come from the people of North Korea, especially Christians. And the only thing the outside world can do to help them is empowerment through information.\"",
      "North Korea is at the top of Open Doors\u2019 World Watch List for persecution of Christians again this year. Open Doors is a global organization that supports and speaks up for Christians persecuted for their faith. The report noted, \"Police and intelligence agents search homes without warning. If they find Christian materials, it is considered a crime against the nation, and the whole family can be banished, imprisoned or executed. Those who use an unregistered smartphone or radio to access unapproved media are punished.\"",
      "The report continued, \"Christians only dare to listen to radio programs at night, hidden under blankets. Each act of worship, even though conducted by oneself, is perceived as an \"act of extreme disloyalty.\" Citizens are trained to report anyone who might be an enemy of the regime, including family members.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday that in a bid to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, he plans to set up a direct meeting between the two countries' leaders, followed by a trilateral meeting in which he would take part.",
      "Trump revealed the next steps in his attempt to broker a peace deal on Truth Social after a full afternoon of meetings at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders who are eager to see Ukraine safeguarded from future Russian aggression.",
      "When the talks ended, Trump wrote, he called Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the arrangements. He spoke to Putin for about 40 minutes in the Oval Office without the European leaders present.",
      "\"Everyone is very happy about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Trump's report comes amid a rapid-fire effort on his part to end a conflict that began more than three years ago with Russia's invasion of its smaller democratic neighbor.",
      "He flew to Alaska on Friday for a face-to-face meeting with Putin and then hastened to invite Zelenskyy and the European leaders to the White House on Monday to make more progress.",
      "The gathering that Trump hosted was an extraordinary spectacle in its own right, carrying echoes of the Second World War. On one day, under one roof, Western leaders assembled in hopes of ending a conflict between a vulnerable European democracy and a bigger dictatorship bent on gobbling up more territory.",
      "Trump met with Zelenskyy at the White House for about an hour in an accelerated effort to end the war on terms acceptable to both sides. The pair then met with European leaders to work toward a breakthrough in a conflict that Trump himself has cautioned could erupt in a third world war if it were allowed to persist.",
      "Trump greeted Zelenskyy in the early afternoon with a smile and a warm handshake \u2014 a stark difference from the tense televised meeting the two men held in February in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump took note of Zelenskyy's more decorous look. Ditching his traditional wartime garb, he wore a dark, formal jacket with a collar.",
      "\"The best I had,\" Zelenskyy told him.",
      "\"I love it!\" Trump said.",
      "Fresh off his summit with Putin, Trump sat down with Zelenskyy to see whether they can resolve sticking points centered on Ukraine's future security and the status of territory the Russian military has seized in eastern and southern Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said later that their private meeting in the Oval Office went well. \u201cWe had a very good conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the best one.\u201d",
      "Asked whether U.S. troops would help secure a peace deal, Trump did not rule out the possibility.",
      "As a condition of ending the war, Putin has insisted that his country retain about 20% of Ukrainian territory that it now controls. Zelenskyy has said Ukraine's constitution forbids him to cede any land.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy spoke to the news media in the Oval Office before they went behind closed doors. Trump suggested he will not abandon efforts to forge a peace deal, though he conceded the Russia-Ukraine conflict has proved particularly stubborn.",
      "\"It's never the end of the road,\" Trump said. \"People are being killed, and we want to stop that. So I would say it's not the end of the road. I think we have a good chance of doing it.\"",
      "When a reporter asked whether he was prepared redraw Ukraine's map if it would end the war sooner, Zelenskyy did not answer directly.",
      "\"We need to stop this war,\" he said. \"To stop Russia, we need support from American and from European partners.\"",
      "Upon finishing the meeting, Trump and Zelenskyy went straight to another meeting with the European leaders: French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "\"We will come to a resolution today I think on almost everything, including probably the security,\" Trump said before the start of that meeting.",
      "After they finished the talks, Trump and the European leaders moved into the Oval Office for further discussions, according to a White House official.",
      "Europe looms large in any accord between the combatants. Looking to prevent future Russian attacks, European nations would be an important part of any security guarantees that Ukraine has requested as part of any peace deal.",
      "But the United States also may play a part, Trump said \u2014 a surprising admission from the \"America First\" president. If there is a Trump foreign policy doctrine, it is that he wants to extricate the United States from foreign wars and shift some of the peacekeeping burden from the United States to other countries.",
      "Yet when he was asked whether he would deploy Americans to Ukraine to help preserve a peace deal, Trump did not dismiss the idea out of hand.",
      "\"We're going to work with Ukraine, we're going to work with everybody, and we're going to make sure that if there is peace, the peace is going to stay long-term,\" he said.",
      "With the TV cameras present, the tone was far more cordial than in Zelenskyy's last visit. In that February meeting, Vice President JD Vance sat beside Trump and berated Zelenskyy for not showing enough gratitude to Trump. This time, Vance sat in the same place but stayed silent.",
      "In the last visit, Trump memorably told Zelenskyy that he didn't hold any \"cards\" and that his country was \"in big trouble.\"",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that\u2019s backed you,\u201d he told Zelenskyy at the time.",
      "The meeting was ultimately cut short.",
      "Who holds the better \"cards\" at this point? a reporter asked Trump on Monday.",
      "\"I don't want to say that,\" he replied.",
      "Trump has lately stepped up his role in ending the conflict. With an eye on the Nobel Peace Prize, he met privately with Putin at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday to jump-start peace talks. He and Putin strode down a red carpet together before a private meeting that lasted nearly three hours.",
      "Though he said beforehand that  he wanted a ceasefire, Trump left the summit without one and said he was shifting his aim, instead, toward a full-fledged \"peace agreement.\"",
      "The Trump administration's messaging has at times been muddled. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News' \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a ceasefire was \u201cnot off the table.\"",
      "Rubio said in the interview that \u201cno one is pushing Ukraine to give that up,\u201d referring to land occupied by Russia. Later in the day, Trump appeared to undercut Rubio when he reposted a Truth Social user who declared, \u201cUkraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!\u201d",
      "Sunday night on Truth Social, Trump seemed to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, as opposed to Putin, who sent tanks rolling into Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Trump wrote that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and also abandon any hope of joining NATO \u2014 one of Putin's demands.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Zelenskyy took a different stance. He wrote late Sunday on X that \u201cRussia must end this war, which it itself started.\u201d",
      "The meetings Monday give the leaders a forum to discuss future security guarantees for Ukraine, which U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff floated as potentially looking similar to NATO\u2019s Article 5.",
      "Ukraine hopes to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee, similar to Article 5's all-for-one provision, and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals. The security guarantees should be a treaty-level obligation, the source said, which require Senate approval.",
      "A challenge for Zelenskyy is to persuade Trump that Russia should give up the territory it seized by force. A European official said it was their belief that Ukraine would never give up all of its eastern Donbas region, much of which Russia controls.",
      "In the run-up to the Alaska summit, Trump said an end to the war would include \u201csome swapping of territories.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy promptly shot down the prospect, saying, \u201cUkrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d"

Most of them had face coverings on.\u201d",
      "When DeSue went to investigate, the driver \u2014 whose name appeared on the food app as \u201cSidi\u201d \u2014 was being questioned, first about his vehicle\u2019s registration and then about his immigration status, he said.",

      "The incident is one of several arrests of delivery drivers recorded by eyewitnesses across the Washington area that have gone viral since the Trump administration took over law enforcement in the nation\u2019s capital last week.",
      "The videos, scattered across social media and shared among D.C. delivery driver chat groups, are having a chilling effect on the drivers themselves. Some of them have chosen to stop making deliveries in the city.",

      "On Sunday afternoon, DeSue said, an area where 15 to 20 delivery drivers typically would be parked out front of his home looking at their phones for their next orders was an empty lot.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a driver anywhere in the last two days,\u201d he said.",

      "Last Thursday, Vasquez witnessed and recorded the arrest of a delivery driver named Josue Mercedes Franco Cerros, who she said would often come by the restaurant to pick up deliveries.",
      "\u201cHe was in front of the restaurant when I see that there are two policemen and they have him,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give a single explanation. The police would tell him to lift up his hair because they wanted to take a photo. The guy was nervous, he was in shock, crying, of course, because he was working, and for the police to arrive all of a sudden, anyone would get nervous.\u201d",
      "Cerros, a Honduran national, was eventually taken away by law enforcement. His bike was loaded on a truck with the logo of D.C.\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department on it, according to Vasquez and video obtained by NBC News. Almost a day later, Cerros appeared on the ICE detainee locator database in ICE custody in Virginia, where he remained Monday evening.",
      "Veronica Gonzalez, a friend of Cerros\u2019, said he had been living in the area for at least 10 years and had worked delivery during the day and at a local restaurant at night.",
      "\u201cHe never thought that something would happen,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cBecause all that we saw in the news, I said, \u2018Son, you have to be careful.\u2019 And he would say, \u2018No, no, I don\u2019t think anything will happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the detentions of Cerros and Sidi or to a question about whether the detentions of delivery drivers like them are part of a coordinated effort to stop and check the immigration statuses of delivery drivers. The Metropolitan Police Department referred questions to the mayor\u2019s office, which did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

      "President Donald Trump said he plans to set up a direct meeting between Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, followed by a trilateral meeting in which he would take part, the latest move in his rapid-fire effort to broker a peace deal in a war that has raged for more than three years.",
      "After meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders yesterday at the White House, Trump detailed his push for further talks in a post on Truth Social. He said he called Putin to discuss arrangements for a meeting.",
      "The meeting with Zelenskyy came three days after Trump traveled to Alaska to meet with Putin. And notably, yesterday\u2019s affair was a stark contrast to Zelenskyy\u2019s last visit to the Oval Office in February. Then, Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy, Trump said Ukraine was \u201cin big trouble\u201d and the meeting was ultimately cut short.",

Zelenskyy said that the meeting went well.",

      "Trump also suggested the U.S. may play a part in a peace deal. When asked whether he would deploy American troops to Ukraine, he did not dismiss the idea.

      "After his February fiasco in the Oval Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's \"fabulous\" fashion decision \u2014 as well as the golf club, personal letter and supportive European leaders he brought with him \u2014 appear to have helped shift the mood of his high-level White House talks on peace with Russia.",
      "While the Kremlin publicly smarted, a sense of relief swept through Ukraine and across Europe after the summit with President Donald Trump. Zelenskyy hailed it Tuesday as \u201ca truly significant step\u201d toward ending the war.",
      "His team came away from the talks relieved that worst case scenarios were avoided and pleased that Trump now appears to recognize the crucial importance of security guarantees for Kyiv to secure any peace agreement \u2014 and the need for the U.S. to play a role in those arrangements, a source familiar with the Ukrainian government\u2019s thinking told NBC News.",
      "Russia may never agree to such a concept and Trump may yet change his mind but for the moment, they were satisfied with the day\u2019s conversations, the source said.",
      "That optimism was thanks at least in part to the tone set by the Ukrainian leader's arrival in a blazer-style jacket and collared shirt, a departure from his trademark military garb.",
      "A fixation on attire might seem trivial given the stakes as the world leaders gathered to discuss ending the brutal conflict, but style mattered here.",
      "For Europe\u2019s leaders, the meeting was about optics as much as substance: A chance to undo any ground Russian President Vladimir Putin may have gained with Trump in Alaska last week.",
      "\u201cI love it,\u201d Trump said as he greeted Zelenskyy, no doubt sparking a sigh of relief from the suited gaggle of European heads of state who had flown in determined to avoid a repeat of February's bust-up, when Zelenskyy was lambasted for not wearing a suit and accused of disrespecting the White House.",
      "Zelenskyy had clearly adjusted his approach to diplomacy beyond his outfit, opening with a flurry of 11 \u201cthank yous\u201d in four and a half minutes, a striking contrast with February when he was branded ungrateful.",

      "\u201cThis round of talks was won by Ukraine and its allies outright,\u201d Serhii Kosiianchuk, a 39-year-old account manager from Kyiv, told NBC News. He said he was \u201cimpressed\u201d by the meeting, adding that \u201cprevious mistakes\u201d had been taken into account.",
      "But the theater may have overshadowed the thinness of concrete results.",
      "Welcoming the contrast to the \"fiasco\" of February, graphic designer Kateryna Gonchar, 38, was nonetheless cautious about the path forward.

    "summary": "The Dallas Cowboys have not reached the NFC Championship in 30 years. But their lack of on-field success has not hindered their popularity and profits.",
    "story": [
      "On a Hollywood red carpet last week, Jerry Jones, the owner of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, was asked about his team's upcoming season.",
      "\u201cIf we get that offensive line rolling,\u201d Jones told an interviewer, \u201cwe\u2019ll have a good team.\u201d",
      "What counts as a \"good\" season is more subjective in Dallas than anywhere else \u2014 and it's why, ever since Jones purchased the team for $140 million in 1989, there has been no other North American professional sports franchise quite like the Cowboys.",
      "Since they won Super Bowls in 1992, 1993 and 1995, the Cowboys have not advanced to a conference championship game in 30 years, the fourth-longest active drought in the NFL. That lack of on-field performance would typically doom a franchise's relevance.",
      "Not the Cowboys.",
      "Since the 1996 season, Dallas has employed eight head coaches, irked several of its biggest superstars during drawn-out contract negotiations and lost 13 of its last 18 playoff games. Yet with Jones keenly keeping them in the conversation, they have won the mindshare of a global audience.",
      "The reason Jones was strolling the red carpet was the premiere of \"America's Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys,\" a Netflix docuseries about Jones and his team's decades of drama. It began streaming only days after Sportico ranked the Cowboys as the NFL's most valuable franchise, with a worth north of $12 billion. Last year, CNBC also ranked Dallas as the NFL's most valuable team, while Forbes named it the world's most valuable sports franchise.",
      "The Cowboys' value and mystique have been perpetually increased by Jones, 82, who carries official titles of owner, president and general manager of the team while also serving as its chief ringmaster, one uniquely attuned to what fans want.",
      "\"I do believe if we\u2019re not being looked at, then I\u2019ll do my part to get us looked at,\" Jones said at the Netflix premiere. \"The beautiful thing for networks, if you will, streaming companies, is that the NFL is a 365-day-a-year interest factory. A lot of programming you have to spend as much ... to promote it as you to do make it. The Cowboys are a soap opera 365 days a year. When it gets low, I\u2019ll stir it up.\"",
      "And few teams capitalize on and court that attention like they do.",
      "Despite their 7-10 record in 2024, 13 games involving the team still ranked among the 100 most-watched prime-time telecasts of last year, which tied with Kansas City for most among all NFL teams. To no surprise, six Dallas games will be broadcast nationally and in prime time this season, second only to Kansas City.",
      "According to Fanatics, the global sports merchandise retailer, the team ranks among the five best-selling teams on its platform, across all sports, since 2023. Dallas' merchandise has been sold in more than 110 countries.",
      "The Cowboys have reached the divisional round of the playoffs, one round away from the NFC championship, four times since 2009, only to lose all four times. Last year, their playoff hopes were doused by midseason after an injury to quarterback Dak Prescott. And yet they remained the NFL's hottest ticket in 2024.",
      "On StubHub, the online ticket retailer, the Cowboys sold not only the most tickets of any team, but they did so overwhelmingly \u2014 selling 63% more tickets than the second-ranked team.",
      "Entering this season, few are buying Jones' team as a title contender. Only 1% of futures bets on DraftKings Sportsbook have been placed on the Cowboys to win the NFC championship, according to a company spokesperson. Still, that hasn't depressed demand to watch Dallas play, with the team selling more tickets entering the 2025 season than any other team \u2014 including 40% more than the even the second-ranked Buffalo Bills, according to a StubHub spokesperson.",
      "It costs 89% less to watch Buffalo, a Super Bowl contender featuring the reigning Most Valuable Player in Josh Allen, on the road this year than the Cowboys, according to the company. The spokesperson wrote that the Dallas spike may reflect several factors, \"including the team\u2019s national fan base and widespread brand recognition.\"",
      "Beyond the revenue they bring in, the Cowboys have understood how to win the attention economy, too. The latest Netflix docuseries isn\u2019t the streamer\u2019s first foray into the Cowboys\u2019 culture. After the docuseries \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders\u201d debuted in the summer of 2024, it was ranked in Netflix\u2019s global top 10 for English TV for four consecutive weeks, and it was ranked among the top 10 U.S. TV shows for five straight weeks, according to the company. It wound up ranked in the top-10 TV list for 27 countries \u2014 proving yet again that the team\u2019s success or failure on the field are only notionally connected to its popularity. (It has been renewed for a third season.)",
      "In 2010, the Cowboys topped Nielsen's media-exposure rankings in part by producing the largest gross audience during nationally televised games. More than a decade later, that exposure transcends borders. In 2024, one firm's analysis of Google search data suggested that more Google searches per month were Cowboys-related than there were any other team. Much of that interest could be attributed to decisions stoked by Jones.",
      "In the winter, his promotion of the team's offensive coordinator to head coach was received unfavorably locally. He has prolonged contract talks in recent seasons with Prescott and receiver CeeDee Lamb before he reached deals on the eve of the regular season. The situation has led to calls for Jones to step down as the general manager overseeing the roster but kept the Cowboys a nonstop sports-talk topic.",
      "This month, the cycle has repeated again with star defender Micah Parsons. Since Parsons, who is seeking a lucrative new contract, asked for a trade this month, Jones has regularly held media briefings during the team's preseason practices and offered cryptic updates.",
      "On the red carpet, Jones acknowledged that when he bought the Cowboys in 1989, he personally had only a fraction of the required money to actually pay for them, relying on borrowed money to make up the difference, and that once he was in charge, he was \"winging\" running an NFL franchise, losing what he said was often $1 million per month. But what Jones knew, instinctually, was how to keep eyes on his team. When the Cowboys opened a new stadium in 2009, it included a new innovation. To walk from their locker room to the field, Cowboys players had to use a tunnel that passed between a pair of glass-walled lounges from which high-paying fans could watch.",
      "\u201cIt is wonderful to have the great athletes and the great players, but there\u2019s something more there,\" Jones said last week. \"There\u2019s sizzle, there\u2019s emotion, and, if you will, there\u2019s controversy. That controversy is good stuff in terms of keeping and having people\u2019s attention.\u201d"

By early August, he couldn\u2019t get close enough to take measurements. The summer melt was so fierce that the caves had become too unstable to enter. Setting up a zoom lens, he found only one stake still in place.",

    "summary": "The senator from Missouri is increasingly focused on appealing to working-class voters \u2014 even if that means criticizing his party or teaming up with Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "Since he took office in 2019, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has sought to place himself on the front lines of orienting the Republican Party around a mix of economic populism and social conservatism to appeal to an increasingly working-class base.",
      "But now, with Republicans in full control of Congress for the first time since he arrived in Washington, Hawley\u2019s mission is coming into conflict with members of his party, who are frustrated with his tendency to follow the beat of his own drum as he grows more critical of some of their policy aims.",
      "Republicans, both in Congress and in the White House, are increasingly talking about Hawley\u2019s moves with the assumption that he is considering a presidential campaign, five people familiar with such discussions told NBC News.",
      "A senior Senate aide said it appeared that Hawley was \u201ctrying to load up policy prescriptions to lay the groundwork for a 2028 presidential bid.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s aligned himself with Democrats on most fiscal issues,\" the aide added. \"Frankly, it has irked a lot of his Republican colleagues.\"",
      "But Hawley\u2019s allies say no 2028 plotting is afoot. Rather, they argue that Hawley continues to pursue the same agenda he has since he took office: aligning the party\u2019s policies with its changing electorate.",
      "\u201cJosh believes we\u2019re at a critical inflection point in our history about where the party\u2019s realigning,\u201d a person close to him said. \u201cHe\u2019s been on the same mission, focusing on the same project since he first ran for office, believing that the Republican Party needs to become a party of working people. What he\u2019s done is consistent with that each year he\u2019s been in Congress.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe said many times in the past he\u2019s not running for president,\u201d this person added. \u201cHe has not been to early states, like a lot of other members. He\u2019s not even visited Iowa or New Hampshire to campaign for someone. He hasn\u2019t done any of that. He\u2019s got plenty of work to do in Congress. And the president\u2019s still got three more years.\u201d",
      "'Not viewed as a team player'",
      "Tensions between Hawley and Republican leaders reached a boiling point late last month when he teamed up with Democrats to advance a ban on congressional stock trading.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., the chair of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and an opponent of stock trading bans, granted Hawley the opportunity to mark up his bill, dubbed the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments \u2014 or PELOSI \u2014 Act. But Paul said he would not support it, requiring Hawley to work with Democrats. Hawley joined forces with Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., the ranking member on the panel, but did not consult with fellow Republicans or the White House before he did so, three people familiar with the episode recalled.",
      "\u201cI can imagine he\u2019s not on their nice list,\u201d a Republican senator told NBC News when asked how the White House views Hawley.",
      "Hawley and Peters reached a compromise under which the legislation would no longer be labeled the \u201cPELOSI Act\u201d and the ban would also apply to presidents and vice presidents. (Hawley secured a tweak that would delay implementation for officials until the start of their next terms, effectively exempting President Donald Trump.) The bill advanced with unified Democratic support plus Hawley\u2019s vote.",
      "\u201cThe president just endorsed it at the White House,\u201d Hawley told NBC News after reporters asked Trump about the bill. But moments later, Trump lashed out.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think real Republicans want to see their President, who has had unprecedented success, TARGETED,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, \u201cbecause of the \u2018whims\u2019 of a second-tier Senator named Josh Hawley!\u201d",
      "Hawley said a subsequent conversation with Trump went well, adding that both he and Trump want to see a congressional stock trading ban enacted.",
      "\u201cEvery action Senator Hawley takes is rooted in one thing: fighting for the people of Missouri,\u201d Bernadette Breslin, a Hawley spokesperson, said in a statement. \u201cHe believes the President is doing a great job and is proud to stand with him in putting America First.\u201d",
      "The White House pointed to press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u2019s comments this month that \u201cconceptually, [Trump], of course, supports the idea of ensuring that members of Congress and United States senators who are here for public service cannot enrich themselves.\u201d",
      "Two Trump administration officials familiar with the spat did not deny that Hawley\u2019s recent actions have Trump\u2019s attention and said some in the White House view him as trying to have it both ways: setting himself up for a future presidential run by differentiating himself from Vice President JD Vance and the White House, while also taking credit for Trump\u2019s accomplishments.",
      "\u201cIt does not work that way,\u201d one of the officials said, adding, \u201cTo say he\u2019s not viewed as a team player in any way would be an understatement.\u201d",
      "But in the weeks since the blowup, people close to Trump have renewed a push to pass a congressional stock ban. MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk this month posted approvingly of Hawley\u2019s compromise legislation with Democrats. And last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for a ban on congressional stock trading.",
      "Hawley\u2019s allies sought to highlight his get-things-done mentality, particularly for his home state, even when it required battling members of his own party or teaming up with the opposition. They point to recent examples such as securing the inclusion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act and a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals in the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d and language to protect a hospital at Fort Leonard Wood as part of a military and veterans affairs funding bill.",
      "At the same time, he has played a leading role in redefining bipartisanship in Washington on consumer and tech issues while providing Republicans a policy road map to reach the working-class voters who have increasingly become part of the party\u2019s coalition.",
      "In turn, Democrats who spoke with NBC News had complimentary things to say about Hawley, a hard-line social conservative.",
      "\u201cIn the Senate, you have to work across the aisle to get things done, and I appreciate that Senator Hawley and I have been able to do that on a number of issues,\u201d Peters said in a statement. \u201cHis willingness to stand up to his own party on policies like banning Members of Congress from stock trading is rare in this political climate.\u201d",
      "This year alone, Hawley has teamed up with Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., on legislation to enhance child labor laws; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., on a bill to bar artificial intelligence firms from training models on stolen, copyrighted materials; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on an effort to cap credit card interest rates; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on legislation to further regulate pharmacy benefit managers, among other measures.",
      "\u201cThe new bipartisanship that K Street will be talking about in 2029 won\u2019t be moderate members of Congress from moderate districts in the suburbs of Chicago, the suburbs of major cities, getting together on a thoughtful center-out coalition,\u201d said Sam Geduldig, a Republican lobbyist and partner at CGCN Group, a lobbying firm. \u201cThe new bipartisanship is Josh Hawley and Liz Warren getting together.\u201d",
      "The new bipartisanship",
      "Hawley, 45, burst onto the scene six years ago with an array of efforts aimed at taking on big tech firms and found some natural allies on the left.",
      "\u201cHe has really led that shift towards a more populist Republican Party,\u201d said a GOP operative who has worked with Hawley\u2019s team. \u201cObviously, the president played a big role in a lot of the economic populism, and the senator has been in line with the president on that.\u201d",
      "But Hawley was soon written off by Democrats, and some Republicans, after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, when he was seen entering the Capitol raising a fist to protesters assembled outside and later moved forward with his objection to the electoral vote count.",
      "Still, Hawley has managed to overcome the objections. When he was asked last month about his vote to confirm a former top Hawley aide to a lifetime judicial post in Missouri, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, admitted to a reporter that he made \u201ca mistake,\u201d given the nominee\u2019s anti-abortion rights record, but said, \u201cI took Josh Hawley\u2019s advice.\u201d",
      "Blumenthal said in an interview: \u201cWell, Jan. 6 remains in the back of a lot of people\u2019s minds. At the same time, on issues where we can make progress stopping corporate greed or monopolistic control over markets, there\u2019s a need for allies. The iconic Jan. 6 photo of him with a fist in the air can\u2019t be erased from memory. But if he can bring Republican support to the table for ideas that will help people, sometimes working together makes sense.\u201d",
      "Blumenthal said that while he and Hawley maintain vehement disagreements on many issues, he praised Hawley as \u201cdistinctive\u201d for his willingness \u201cto think outside the usual Republican comfort zone.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrankly, he is an extremely good partner. He\u2019s very smart and insightful. We vote differently most of the time. In fact, probably the vast majority of our votes are different. But he is a public official who seeks common ground, especially on technology issues where privacy and individual rights are at stake,\u201d Blumenthal said, adding: \u201cHe is regarded as open to new ideas, to kind of forge his own path. He seems to be pretty independent-minded on a number of issues.\u201d",
      "Hawley\u2019s style has allowed him to carve out a unique space in Congress. Sean O\u2019Brien, the general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said Hawley was the first Republican his union \u201cactually formed a relationship with.\u201d O\u2019Brien would later offer praise to Hawley during a speech before the Republican National Convention last summer, an unheard-of appearance for a major labor union leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked on many issues,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding he had no sense of whether Hawley would pursue the White House in 2028.",
      "\u201cLook, there\u2019s nobody more prepared,\u201d O\u2019Brien continued. \u201cIf you watch these hearings, whether someone likes Josh Hawley, they don\u2019t like Josh Hawley, you can\u2019t deny the fact that he is prepared and he does not discriminate against anybody, and he strictly follows a moral compass that\u2019s in the best interest of the American people. And look, I\u2019m a huge fan.\u201d",
      "Hawley also raised eyebrows within his own party when he slammed the Medicaid cuts in Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d \u2014 which he voted in favor of after having secured some concessions.",
      "Shortly after Trump signed the legislation into law, Hawley held an event in Missouri to tout it, namely its inclusion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which provides cash benefits to victims who have suffered serious ailments because of radiation exposure. A person familiar with conversations between Hawley and the administration said Hawley \u201cpressured\u201d the White House to include the fund in the megabill \u201cso he would stop trashing the bill.\u201d",
      "Hawley said in an interview at the event that members have \u201cgot to take the wins that you can,\u201d adding that including the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act \u201cwas key to my vote.\u201d But if Hawley\u2019s criticisms of the legislation have subsided, they did not entirely vanish. Less than two weeks after Trump signed the megabill into law, Hawley introduced a bill to repeal some of its key Medicaid provisions. Around the same time, he introduced a bill to provide tariff rebate checks to Americans, another move that put him at odds with some colleagues.",
      "The senior Senate aide who sees Hawley working toward a 2028 bid said Hawley was finding a way to \u201cgum up the works\u201d and be \u201cthe problem child\u201d at \u201cevery major inflection point and just consistently being the problem with regards to passing the president\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s frustrated a lot of Republicans who kind of view it as self-serving and not being a team player,\u201d this person said.",
      "The Senate aide said that in an environment in which Vance clearly has the inside lane for the populist right, it is difficult to see how Hawley could break through. But regardless of what Hawley has planned politically or on policy, this person said, he will not be deterred.",
      "\u201cHe has a plan,\u201d this person said. \u201cHe knows what he wants to do. And he does not really care what anyone else thinks about it.\u201d"

      "When his driver took longer than usual, DeSue checked the app and noticed something seemed wrong \u2014 the delivery driver\u2019s GPS location had stopped short of his address. He went outside to look for him.",
      "\u201cI stepped into the street, I looked down and see lights in the direction, like police lights, in the direction of where my driver was,\u201d DeSue said in an interview. \u201cIt was my driver by himself and, like, nine different officers all wearing different uniforms. ... Most of them had face coverings on.\u201d",
      "When DeSue went to investigate, the driver \u2014 whose name appeared on the food app as \u201cSidi\u201d \u2014 was being questioned, first about his vehicle\u2019s registration and then about his immigration status, he said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gonna come with us, you\u2019re gonna come with us today,\u201d a masked agent can be heard telling Sidi in video that DeSue recorded and provided to NBC News.",
      "\u201cCan you tell me in Arabic, please?\u201d Sidi says, adding that he did not understand what was being said and that he was nervous.",
      "One of the agents, wearing a vest emblazoned \u201cPOLICE HSI\u201d \u2014 short for Homeland Security Investigations, a part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 replies that they do not have an Arabic translator. The men then cuff Sidi\u2019s hands, waist and feet before they put him in an unmarked car. DeSue said he has since reported the incident to Uber.",
      "NBC News has not been able to verify the driver\u2019s full name, nationality or location, and Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The incident is one of several arrests of delivery drivers recorded by eyewitnesses across the Washington area that have gone viral since the Trump administration took over law enforcement in the nation\u2019s capital last week.",
      "The videos, scattered across social media and shared among D.C. delivery driver chat groups, are having a chilling effect on the drivers themselves. Some of them have chosen to stop making deliveries in the city.",
      "It has been \u201cfive days since working, looking at what to do. And, well, closed down here waiting for things to pass, because I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d a D.C.-area delivery driver who did not want to be named told NBC News in a voice message in Spanish.",
      "On Sunday afternoon, DeSue said, an area where 15 to 20 delivery drivers typically would be parked out front of his home looking at their phones for their next orders was an empty lot.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a driver anywhere in the last two days,\u201d he said.",
      "Some other D.C. residents have noticed the dwindling presence of delivery drivers, as well.",
      "\u201cThe number of people who come to pick up orders has diminished,\u201d said Clarissa Vasquez, who works at a restaurant in the Columbia Heights neighborhood. \u201cWe are at 4% of the people who come to pick up food.\u201d",
      "Last Thursday, Vasquez witnessed and recorded the arrest of a delivery driver named Josue Mercedes Franco Cerros, who she said would often come by the restaurant to pick up deliveries.",
      "\u201cHe was in front of the restaurant when I see that there are two policemen and they have him,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give a single explanation. The police would tell him to lift up his hair because they wanted to take a photo. The guy was nervous, he was in shock, crying, of course, because he was working, and for the police to arrive all of a sudden, anyone would get nervous.\u201d",
      "Cerros, a Honduran national, was eventually taken away by law enforcement. His bike was loaded on a truck with the logo of D.C.\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department on it, according to Vasquez and video obtained by NBC News. Almost a day later, Cerros appeared on the ICE detainee locator database in ICE custody in Virginia, where he remained Monday evening.",
      "Veronica Gonzalez, a friend of Cerros\u2019, said he had been living in the area for at least 10 years and had worked delivery during the day and at a local restaurant at night.",
      "\u201cHe never thought that something would happen,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cBecause all that we saw in the news, I said, \u2018Son, you have to be careful.\u2019 And he would say, \u2018No, no, I don\u2019t think anything will happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the detentions of Cerros and Sidi or to a question about whether the detentions of delivery drivers like them are part of a coordinated effort to stop and check the immigration statuses of delivery drivers. The Metropolitan Police Department referred questions to the mayor\u2019s office, which did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

      "The Democratic National Committee is looking to refresh the technology it uses to help organize voters and volunteers with the aim of winning future elections.",
      "It's the first time the DNC has overhauled its technology infrastructure in nearly 20 years, a DNC spokesperson said.",
      "The new tools, which include a platform that helps Democrats host and attend their own political events, were placed in an open request-for-proposal (RFP) process in April to secure vendors who can provide the amalgam of services.",
      "\"The RFP invited a broad range of tools, from innovative voter contact technologies to streamlined volunteer management platforms,\" the committee said in an announcement Tuesday. \"The DNC knows that Democrats needed to redefine the tools we use to organize and communicate with voters and volunteers.\"",
      "Among the new tools is Matchbook, which is billed as a way \"to turn raw data into real strategy,\" including by tracking support and finding voters and volunteers. The company behind Matchbook, Indigo, is a relatively new entrant into the politics-and-tech scene, having launched less than a year ago and getting acquired by another company, Switchboard, in February.",
      "\"We\u2019re really excited for an opportunity to help the DNC, Democratic state parties, and Democratic candidates up and down the ballot find new ways to organize their communities,\" Indigo CEO Max Wood said in an email. \"We\u2019re particularly excited to offer a new approach when it comes to the basics of collecting and leveraging data from organizing programs. If everything goes well, Matchbook will help campaigns develop more personal, long-term relationships with voters and supporters.\"",
      "The announcement comes as the party wrestles with an uncertain road ahead.",
      "The DNC is coming off a disappointing 2024 election cycle, and it continues to face fundraising challenges. It had $15 million on hand at the end of June, well behind the Republican National Committee\u2019s $80 million. Democratic Party polling remains at or near all-time lows.",
      "Many Democrats turned their backs on the party last year for a number of reasons, including former President Joe Biden\u2019s dropping out of the race too late, Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 failing to distinguish herself from his administration and disillusionment with the Democrats due to their stance on the war in Gaza.",
      "What was once seen as an advantage for the Democrats \u2014 data-driven field organizing in the late 2000s was seen as a boost for Barack Obama's presidential campaigns \u2014 has more recently lost its luster. A May report from Higher Ground Labs, a left-leaning venture fund, found that Democratic outreach efforts had floundered.",
      "\"Despite record-scale outreach via text, phone, and door-to-door efforts, declining voter engagement reveals stagnation in effective voter contact strategies, underscoring the need for new methods that prioritize genuine connection and measurable impact, alongside technologies and data that can support them,\" the group found.",
      "The new technology includes a management system to help track interactions among the DNC, voters and volunteers; software that encourages \"high-quality interactions with voters\"; and a platform to empower Democrats to participate in online and offline events.",
      "The tools were selected for a pilot program, and the DNC will begin using them immediately, including in the New Jersey and Virginia Democratic parties ahead of the elections in November, it said.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin said the committee's goal is \"organizing everywhere to win anywhere.\"",
      "\"We take our responsibility seriously to ensure that Democratic campaigns everywhere have the best, most modern, and most effective tools available to engage with voters and win elections,\" Martin said in a statement.",
      "\"We\u2019re excited to be piloting and investing in innovative and emerging technologies that will benefit the Democratic ecosystem and campaigns for years to come,\" he added."

And when I went back as a security contractor in 2018, what I began to realize is that I was just watching vast amounts of taxpayer money getting put into the pockets of defense contractors, of security contractors, of this whole apparatus that almost seemed to exist merely to take taxpayer money and put it into somebody\u2019s private bank account. And in seeing that up close for a while, it turned me into a deeply, deeply cynical and angry guy. From that I began to kind of look at our larger political system, our larger economic system, and you just begin to see the same exact thing.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf we focus primarily on fighting for working-class values, fighting for policies that help working-class people, clawing back a lot of the power that has been consolidated in the kind of higher establishment-class politics, I think if you stick to that stuff, you can win,\u201d Platner said. \u201cAnd getting dragged into many of these minor culture war fights is not remotely the answer.\u201d",

      "While it may seem unconventional to use a bookcase for a shoe rack, Solomon said the Billy Bookcase from Ikea is one of her favorite \u201cno-nonsense\u201d ways to store her heels and show them off for visitors. The bookcase has adjustable shelves so you can move them around according to the height of your shoes \u2014 boots, for example, will need more space than a pair of sandals. But each shelf is only about 11 inches deep (about a size 11 in men\u2019s shoes or a women\u2019s 12), so make sure that works for your shoe collection. There are six shelves, and assuming you can place around three pairs of shoes per shelf, it should fit 18 pairs of shoes. Solomon also recommended the shorter version of the bookcase for those with half the pairs of shoes.",

For those who don\u2019t want to spend the time or money on customized builds, Meck recommended this stackable shoe shelf from The Container Store.

ClosetMaid specifically singles out any that measure smaller than 5.75 inches tall by 4.5 inches wide by 11 inches deep. The organizer comes in three colors: white, espresso and dark cherry.",
      "How to decide what shoe storage solution to buy",
      "Organize your shoesBefore buying any kind of shoe storage, McGreevy encourages a shoe cleanse: Categorize all of your shoes first and then place them side-by-side and decide whether to hold on to them, donate them or throw them away. \u201cGoing through this step is important so that you don\u2019t end up organizing extra pairs of shoes or buying more storage than you need,\u201d she said. \u201cCount how many pairs \u2014 and how many of each type \u2014 you have after decluttering. Purchase storage based on those numbers.\u201d",
      "Factor in shoe sizeAfter you assess which shoes need to go in the shoe case, look at your space as a whole. The type of shoe organizer you buy should also depend on the size of your space and how often you wear each pair, McGreevy said.",
      "Wear frequencySolomon agreed and added that the frequency at which you wear your favorite pairs is especially important when searching for shoe storage, since you won\u2019t want to tuck away shoes into individual storage bins if you plan on wearing them frequently. Instead, opt for open storage like a shoe cubby or shoe rack that allows for easy access, Solomon suggested. An over-the-door shoe bag could work for someone who doesn\u2019t need their collection in plain sight, she said. Plus, it frees up floor space.",
      "How to properly store shoes",
      "Generally, you should make sure you\u2019re storing shoes somewhere that isn\u2019t directly hit by sunlight but is well-ventilated and cleaned regularly, according to Meck. This can help prevent shoes from becoming damaged or collecting dust.",
      "For shoes that you want to pack away, Meck explained that wrapping them in tissue paper (and even old clothes) can keep them from scraping or scuffing together.",
      "For those shoes you reach for regularly, Solomon recommended leaving them around an entryway to prevent dirt from traveling further into your house or apartment.",
      "Here are a few other expert-recommended tips to consider when arranging your shoe storage:",
      "Boots: Both McGreevy and Solomon suggested using shapers in order to help maintain their shape and keep them standing straight. The two recommended this affordable option from The Container Store. For seasonal shoes like winter and rain boots, Solomon recommends the best place for storage is in an entryway closet or mudroom, especially if you don\u2019t want to drag in dirt from outside.Sneakers: Avoid sealed storage like storage bins for sneakers since these shoes need to breathe to look fresh and new, Solomon said. She\u2019s a fan of stocking sneakers in shoe cubbies, especially for someone who has a larger collection that they want to show off.Heels: Those who have a bigger selection of high heels should look between the shelves of a shoe shelf. Solomon recommended avoiding shoe racks with slats, as they \u201calways lead to heels getting stuck in between the rungs,\u201d or slanted shelves, as shoes tend to fall off the racks more easily.\u201d",

Jared Golden, D-Maine, has opted against joining the budding primary in what, on paper, might look like Democrats\u2019 best opportunity to flip a Senate seat in 2026. Collins is the only Republican senator who represents a state Kamala Harris carried in the last presidential election.",
      "But she has proven a tough opponent in blue Maine. In her last campaign, in 2020, she beat Democratic opponent Sarah Gideon by more than 8 percentage points, even as Donald Trump lost Maine by more than 9 points.",

And when I went back as a security contractor in 2018, what I began to realize is that I was just watching vast amounts of taxpayer money getting put into the pockets of defense contractors, of security contractors, of this whole apparatus that almost seemed to exist merely to take taxpayer money and put it into somebody\u2019s private bank account. And in seeing that up close for a while, it turned me into a deeply, deeply cynical and angry guy. From that I began to kind of look at our larger political system, our larger economic system, and you just begin to see the same exact thing.\u201d",
      "Platner is seeking to connect with working-class voters who\u2019ve migrated toward the GOP in recent cycles. He pointed to Golden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., as figures offering hope for the Democratic Party nationally and in his state.",
      "\u201cIf we focus primarily on fighting for working-class values, fighting for policies that help working-class people, clawing back a lot of the power that has been consolidated in the kind of higher establishment-class politics, I think if you stick to that stuff, you can win,\u201d Platner said. \u201cAnd getting dragged into many of these minor culture war fights is not remotely the answer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t just identify with the more of the left parts of the party. People like Jared Golden are doing an excellent job. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been able to hold on to a Democratic seat in a Trump district,\u201d Platner said.",

    "story": [
      "Morgan Cadenhead accumulated 150,000 TikTok followers in just 10 days as a result of her nontraditional sorority rush style. Now she's waiting to see her story play out on Lifetime's new reality show, \"A Sorority Mom's Guide to Rush!\"",
      "\"Rush is like 'The Hunger Games' for college girls,\" Morgan says in a video interview with TODAY.com.",
      "Responding to the negative attention some of her videos attracted, she adds, \"I know how things go for me personally on TikTok. So I'm just really nervous about people taking portions of it to suit other needs.\"",
      "Morgan's mom, Lori Cadenhead, is right by Morgan's side in the interview, just as she is on the reality show, which follows Morgan's journey through the 2024 rush process at the University of Alabama. Morgan rushed for a second time in 2024 because she did not receive a bid in 2023.",
      "\"My mom was like, 'You should rush! That'd be so cool if you got in. And then we could do all the parent events and stuff,'\" Morgan says.",
      "Lori, who learned about sorority life through HBO's 2023 documentary \u201cBama Rush,\u201d says, \"I kind of felt like I pushed her a little bit because in the beginning, she really wasn't gonna rush. And then I kept on bringing up the fact that these are your friends for life. I just wanted her to be part of something.\"",
      "Sorority rush season at the University of Alabama \u2014 Bama Rush for short \u2014 requires a whole new vocabulary with terms like PNMs (potential new members), OOTDs (outfits of the day) and RushTok (the corner of TikTok dedicated to videos about sorority rush week). Well-versed in RushTok, Morgan even posts an OOTD video for this very interview.",
      "In the episode airing on Sept. 1, viewers watch as Morgan gets dropped from rush the second year in a row ... but she certainly grows throughout the process.",
      "\u201cI was really sad because I put a lot into it,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cBut at the same time, it was a relief, because in order to be in a sorority, I would have had to do a complete 180. I don\u2019t know if I would have been 100% myself.\u201d",
      "In a video she posted on Bid Day 2024 that has 1.5 million views, Morgan said, \u201cTo everyone who was dropped or withdrew from recruitment, please remember this: We\u2019re all a part of a much larger sisterhood, one that\u2019s not defined by Greek letters.\"",
      "She also gave a special shoutout to her mom, who traveled from Florida to Tuscaloosa to support her daughter during rush week.",
      "Rush: Take Two",
      "When Morgan first began posting rush videos on TikTok in 2023, she stood out from other PNMs. She gained notoriety for chugging orange juice, dressing differently than other PNMs and perhaps not taking rush \"seriously\" enough.",
      "\"Rushing was a thing that you did, in a sense,\" Morgan explains of her first rush experience. \"It's a great way to meet your classmates before class starts. Is a great way to get connected with the other girls. It is a really nice bonding experience for a lot of the freshmen. So that's kind of why I did it.\"",
      "\"The second time I did it, it was largely because I'd seen what it was about, what they were doing, how they treated each other, how they acted, and I really wanted to be part of it,\" she says. \"I wanted it the second time more than I did the first, I think. I thought that if I gave it a real try, and was a little bit more sorority girl-ish, then maybe I would get in.\"",
      "Lori adds, \"I think there also might have been a little bit of a 'You guys didn't think I was good enough, but I promise I can do this.'\"",
      "Dealing With Negativity",
      "It can be hard for Lori to sit back and watch negative comments appear on Morgan's posts.",
      "\"it sucks. It really does,\" Lori says. \"Especially the last month when Morgan started talking about rush again, I feel like they're coming for her. The comments are just not 'sorority girl sisterhood' comments. Let's just put it that way.\"",
      "The ladies suspect that many of the most negative comments are coming from students on campus. \"They're making fake accounts quicker than their little fingers can type,\" Lori says.",
      "Luckily, however, she notes that her daughter has \"a pretty thick skin.\"",
      "Laughing, Morgan adds, \"I think that it bothers her more than it bothers me personally. I don't mind.\"",
      "In fact, Morgan would absolutely advise an incoming freshman to give Bama Rush a whirl.",
      "\"I'm not not self-aware enough to realize that my experience is one of one,\" she says. \"It was an interesting combination of social media and the way I acted that got me the results that I got. A normal freshman going through this process is not going to have to deal with anything that I've had to deal with.\"",
      "Life After Sorority Rush",
      "Morgan, who will be graduating from college in December, has found her people outside of sororities.",
      "\"I was part of book club. I tried fencing ... wasn't for me,\" she says, pausing for a laugh. \"I mostly just hang out on campus with my friends.\" She will also grab coffee with people who reach out to her via social media. \"One of my closest friends I met that way the first year that I rushed,\" she adds.",
      "Morgan is also funneling her creativity into writing a book. Spoiler alert: It's not about rush.",
      "\"It's a dystopian young adult book and the tagline is, 'What if every 10 years the government made you wipe your memory?'\" she says proudly.",
      "Morgan says she would consider writing about her rush experience, but, she says, \"I'd have to leave school before we ever touch that.\"",
      "Even with all of the ups and downs of rush, Morgan says she wouldn't change a thing.",
      "Her mother, however, would.",
      "\"I wouldn't send her to Alabama,\" she deadpans."

      "Accompanying a countdown the night of Aug. 13, a series of colored locks popped up at the bottom of the site. Dedicated Swift fans knew: Something was coming.",
      "The colored locks \u2014 orange, red, blue and silver \u2014 turned out to be deluxe editions of her previously announced 12th studio, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d Many online users predicted this, and when 7 p.m. ET rolled around, they were proven right.",
      "Now, after listening closely, zooming in on Swift\u2019s background and crunching some numbers, fans think the \u201cNew Heights\u201d episode has even more Easter eggs, which are subtle hints at her next big musical or career move.",
      "Swifties have since formulated a big theory: The international pop sensation will perform at the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "The halftime performer for the 2026 Super Bowl has not yet been announced, so all fan theories are pure speculation at this point. (For context, Kendrick Lamar was announced as the Apple Music Super Bowl 59 Halftime Show performer Sept. 8, 2024.)",
      "What we do know is that the 2026 Super Bowl marks the 60th NFL championship, and the game will be played at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on Feb. 8, 2026. Levi's Stadium is home to the San Francisco 49ers.",
      "Below, we break down three \u201cclues\u201d that some Swift fans are latching onto as they try to predict what\u2019s ahead for the singer.",
      "All That Sourdough Talk",
      "Swift\u2019s \u201cNew Heights\u201d episode featured a rare look inside the singer\u2019s life. Speaking with the co-hosts \u2014 her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce \u2014 she spilled on the beginning of her high-profile romance with the footballer, discussed the recent purchase of her master recordings and finally, previewed her upcoming 12th album.",
      "She also dished on her daily life outside of performing for millions, admitting that she has \u201cgranny\u201d hobbies, which, in her words, \u201ccould be categorized as hobbies you could have had in the 1700s.\u201d",
      "Specifically, she was eager to talk about baking sourdough bread, and revealed some of the flavors she\u2019s made, including cinnamon swirl, blueberry lemon and Funfetti.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really talking about bread 60% of the time now,\u201d Swift said.",
      "Swift is know for being very intentional with her words and actions. For example: She teased that her 11th album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d would actually be a double album by pointedly holding up two fingers during her Grammys acceptance speech in February 2024. She subtly confirmed the Easter egg when she announced the double album on Instagram and included a peace sign emoji.",
      "In a similar vein, intrepid Swifties quickly connected a few dots from this sourdough conversation.",
      "They theorized that 60% might not have been a random number, and instead could have been a reference to Super Bowl 60. Plus, the mascot for the San Francisco 49ers, the home team of Super Bowl 60's Levi\u2019s Stadium, is none other than a gold miner named \u2026 Sourdough Sam.",
      "The official TikTok account for the 49ers has joined in on the fun. The team posted a TikTok amid the flurry of speculation, a video of Levi's Stadium's exterior set to the memorable line of dialogue from \u201cJersey Shore,\u201d \u201cWhat's going on here? Why is everyone acting weird towards me?\u201d",
      "\u201cweird that 4+9 is\u202613,\u201d one user commented on the post, referring to a number long associated with Swift.",
      "Crunching the Numbers",
      "In addition to a passing mention of 60%, Swifties also clocked a few other seemingly random numbers the singer mentioned during her two-hour \u201cNew Heights\u201d interview. At the start, she thanked Jason Kelce for his enthusiastic introduction, saying, \u201cThank you for screaming for, like, 47 seconds for me.\u201d",
      "Later in the episode, when asked how many countries she performed the \u201cEras Tour\u201d in, she answered: 47,000. (The actual answer is 21 countries.)",
      "Some fans dug into that number and realized that the 47th show of Swift\u2019s record-breaking \u201cEras Tour\u201d was at Levi\u2019s Stadium.",
      "They also pointed out that adding Swift\u2019s lucky number, 13 \u2014 the \u201cNew Heights\u201d episode fittingly dropped on Aug. 13 \u2014 to 47, they equal 60. Plus, the 2025-2026 NFL season will mark Swift\u2019s beau Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce\u2019s 13th season.",
      "To fans\u2019 credit, Swift said on the podcast that when it comes to planting an Easter egg, \u201cI love numerology. I love math stuff. I love dates.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m never going to plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life,\u201d Swift added. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be toward music or something I\u2019m coming up with, something I have coming up, a plan I have coming together \u2014 something that you don\u2019t know that I\u2019m saying for a specific reason that you\u2019ll hear later and you\u2019ll go back and be like, \u2018Oh my god.\u2019\u201d",
      "A Glimpse of a Super Bowl Trophy",
      "Then, there\u2019s the background of the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast. Swift and Travis Kelce recorded the podcast together and sat in front of a bookshelf that we already know was filled with Easter eggs.",
      "In the background, fans spotted four boxes in orange, red, blue and silver, labeled with \u201cT.S.\u201d on the front. Like the locks on the website, we now know those boxes represented the four deluxe editions of \u201cThe Life of the Showgirl.\u201d",
      "Also on the shelf? A statue resembling the iconic Vince Lombardi trophy, awarded to each year\u2019s Super Bowl champs. (An important note: Both Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce have won the Super Bowl with their respective NFL teams, so spying that trophy isn\u2019t necessarily out of the ordinary.)",
      "The trophy is positioned on the shelf on its side, which some fans argue could be a play on it being \u201chalfway,\u201d ergo, a wink at the halftime show.",
      "\u201cI want Easter eggs to be a certain thing, where if you are a part of the fandom and you want to experience music in a normal way, then you don\u2019t even see these,\u201d Swift said during the podcast. \u201cYou don\u2019t even care what that thing is above that doorway, under that dimly lit flickering light over there that\u2019s upside down in Braille. You don\u2019t need to know what that is.\u201d",
      "During that moment, some TikTok users slowed down the footage of Swift and think she may have pointing to the trophy and purposefully leaning to the side to put it in view."

      "Swift\u2019s attendance at the game sparked a media flurry, as well as excitement within the entire Chiefs organization, including Travis Kelce's teammates.",
      "Chris Jones, defensive tackle for the Chiefs, said, \u201cYou know the locker room was like, \u2018Taylor Swift\u2019s here. Taylor Swift\u2019s here. For real? With Travis? Oh my god.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my god, Travis pulled Taylor Swift,\u2019\u201d Jones added.",
      "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had a bit more of a heads up than the rest of the team and the world, sharing during the documentary, \u201cHe told me during the week. I was one of those like, \u2018I got to see it, you know? I got to see it until I believe it.\u2019\u201d",
      "In game footage included in the series, Mahomes was filmed talking to Travis Kelce on the sidelines about Swift in the box, telling the tight end, \u201cThat\u2019s the first person I noticed. I didn\u2019t see anybody else.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou definitely felt the buzz and you could see people in the stadium gravitating toward where she was at there,\u201d Mahomes said during the documentary. \u201cBut at the same time, we had business to handle.\u201d",
      "In a post-game interview, Mahomes addressed questions about his teammate\u2019s relationship status, sharing at the time that he had not met the singer. He added, \u201cIf she ends up being with Travis, then I\u2019ll probably get to meet her at some point.\u201d",
      "Chiefs head coach Andy Reid also gave his two cents on the romance between Travis Kelce and Swift, sharing at a press conference that he had already met Swift before and that he \u201cset them up.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy that time, I knew they were going out. I knew her before him,\u201d he explained. \u201cHer dad was a big Eagles fan. She was doing a concert in Philadelphia, so we did the meet and greet thing. She told Travis, \u2018You know, I know your coach.\u2019 And he went, \u2018Oh no.\u2019\u201d",
      "As for the widespread reaction to Swift\u2019s attendance at the game, Chiefs cornerback Trent McDuffie put it best \u2014 \u201cThe Swifties are a real thing. Everybody can feel it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fan base is just going insane,\u201d Chiefs safety Justin Reid explained. \u201cThe sport has just grown tremendously with her being a part of it. The NFL is loving this, I know it. You couldn\u2019t have painted a better picture than to have this happen.\u201d",
      "The documentary also included a moment with Swift after the Chiefs defeated the Buffalo Bills in the AFC championship game in January 2025. The cameras followed Swift on the field, where she stood with quarterback Patrick Mahomes\u2019 wife, Brittany Mahomes, and Travis Kelce\u2019s mom, Donna Kelce.",
      "In the scene, Swift shared her gratitude for the support of Brittany Mahomes during the postseason, alongside Donna Kelce.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve kept me so calm the last couple weeks,\u201d Swift said. \u201cI did not know what to do and I\u2019d just text Brittany and just be like, \u2018Tell me it\u2019s going to be OK. Tell me it\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d",
      "The singer stood between both women and put her arms around them, calling them her \u201ctwo pillars of support.\u201d"

      "Bob Odenkirk reprises his role as Hutch Mansell, an off-the-books government assassin, in \u201cNobody 2.\u201d",
      "The new film, now out in theaters, is a follow up to Odenkirk's 2021 film \u201cNobody,\u201d which introduced the actor as a middle-class working suburban dad with a lethal past.",
      "In the first film, Hutch\u2019s seemingly domestic life unravels after two intruders break into his home. His decision not to fight back strains his marriage and leaves him questioning whom he has become. When a bus fight puts him up against Russian mobster Yulian Kuznetsov, Hutch enlists help from his father, David (Christopher Lloyd), and brother Harry (RZA) to take down Kuznetsov's crew. The film ends with Hutch and his family moving into a new home \u2014 but their return to normal appears to be short-lived when Hutch receives a phone call that suggests his assassin days aren\u2019t quite over yet.",
      "Now, four years later in \u201cNobody 2,\u201d Hutch is still trying to keep his two worlds apart. \u201cIt\u2019s basically about work-life balance but with an assassin as the worker,\u201d Odenkirk tells TODAY.com in an exclusive interview.",
      "Read on to learn more about \u201cNobody 2\u201d and what Odenkirk has to say about the possibility of a \u201cNobody 3\u201d and other sequels.",
      "(Warning: Spoilers from \u201cNobody 2\u201d below\u2026)",
      "What Happens in 'Nobody 2'?",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d opens with Hutch going through the motions of being a contract killer for the government while balancing being an involved dad and devoted husband. Though he feels he's found a way to manage both, Odenkirk tells TODAY.com Hutch knows that's far from the truth.",
      "\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s got a balance in his life, but he knows he\u2019s wrong ... (though) he wishes he did,\u201d Odenkirk says. \u201cHe has his actions, his missions that he\u2019s doing, and he enjoys those. And then he\u2019s got his family, which he is kind of ignoring, and he starts to become very aware of the fact that he\u2019s not staying connected with his family because he\u2019s just too preoccupied.\u201d",
      "In an effort to reconnect with his family, Hutch takes his wife, kids and dad on a summer vacation to a run-down theme park in Plummerville, where his dad once took him and his brother to when they were kids. But his promising family plans quickly unravel when Hutch gets into a dust-up with the local sheriff.",
      "\u201cThe vacation is filled, as most vacations can be, with annoyances and problems and shortcomings, and then that all builds up inside him, and he explodes,\u201d Odenkirk tells TODAY.com.",
      "As tensions mount, Hutch\u2019s instincts take over, and the trip turns into something much more dangerous when he discovers that Plummerville is a base for a massive bootlegging operation. What begins as a chance to bond with his family soon becomes another mission.",
      "In the official trailer, Hutch is seen in brutal physical fights, while his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen) urges him to \u201cfix it\u201d \u2014 a clear sign he\u2019s right back in the kind of high-stakes conflict he can\u2019t seem to avoid.",
      "Though the comedy action film leans more towards \"John Wick\" than \"National Lampoon's Vacation,\" Odenkirk says the film offers relatable moments.",
      "\u201cGetting the garbage out on garbage day and not making it to your son\u2019s basketball games because you are working and trying to plan a vacation,\" Odenkirk explains. \"These are all things I think people can relate to.\u201d",
      "How Does 'Nobody 2' End?",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d ends with a blow out fight between Hutch and his crew and the local police force and mobsters who work for Lendina (Sharon Stone) \u2014 the ruthless crime boss who runs the bootlegging operation through Plummerville. Hutch becomes Lendina's target after he meddles in her operation by saving the theme park operator's son, whom she had kidnapped, and burning down her massive fortune.",
      "Odenkirk calls the \u201clast third of the film ... a James Bond film, but with a family involved.\u201d It includes explosions, large-scale action sequences and an ending that circles back to Hutch\u2019s core conflict: protecting his family while accepting who he really is.",
      "In the end, Lendina and her crew are eliminated after a fiery and  intense battle that ultimately brings the family together following their harrowing experience.",
      "Does 'Nobody 2' Have a Post-Credits Scene?",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d does not have a post-credits scene, but it does have a scene that plays at the beginning of the end-credits.",
      "While most end-credits and post-credits scenes help to wrap up any loose ends from the film or tease the next chapter in a franchise, the final scene in \u201cNobody 2\u201d only offers snapshots of what happened during the family's action-packed vacation in Plummerville. It includes pictures taken by Hutch's daughter that show various moments from their vacation and epic battle at the amusement park.",
      "Will There Be a 'Nobody 3'?",
      "In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, Odenkirk says he would be down to do another \u201cNobody\u201d sequel, officially reprising his role of Hutch.",
      "\u201cI want a 'Nobody 3' and a 'Nobody 4,'\u201d he says. But, according to Odenkirk, there has yet to be an official conversation to get the ball rolling on it.",
      "\u201cIf the audience likes it \u2026 they decide, not us,\u201d he explains.",
      "On the date of publication, \u201cNobody 2\u201d has already scored a 77% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics and a 91% audience score.",
      "What Does Bob Odenkirk Say About 'Nobody 3'?",
      "Whether or not a third \u201cNobody\u201d film gets green-lit, Odenkirk already has a specific direction in mind. Just as \u201cNobody 2\u201d is set four years after the first film, he sees the next installment reflecting another time jump, four years after \u201cNobody 2.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow those kids are older, Hutch really needs to reconnect before they split apart,\u201d he says of his on-screen children, Sammy (Paisley Cadorath) and Brady (Gage Munroe). In a potential third film, Odenkirk says his son would now be a 22-year-old adult, which could bring \u201canother level of trying to stay connected and a different set of tensions and challenges.\u201d",
      "Aside from all the action, Odenkirk says the balance of relatable family dynamics is at the heart of the series. \u201cThese films are meant to ... connect with our audience and connect this character on a common shared sense of family tension, and then let them become part of an action movie.\u201d",
      "He also says there could be space for Becca's backstory, which he revealed they filmed for \"Nobody 2.\"",
      "\"We know that backstory. In fact, we wrote it into \u2018Nobody 2,\u2019 but we didn\u2019t shoot it because we didn\u2019t have room in the story,\" Odenkirk tells TODAY.com. \"But we do know who Hutch and Becca are. We do know how they met, and we do know that they both know, if they cast their minds back to how they met, they both know that they are with a kick a-- spouse, and sometimes they forget that.\"",

During one of the most emotional moments in the movie, Paul goes to his boss and pleads with him to help bring his son home. Wright opens up about shooting the taxing scene to TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the critical question (at the center of the film): \u2018What would you do?\u2019 But in this case, I am in the middle of it,\u201d says Wright. The Academy Award nominee adds that having his son Elijah portray Kyle \u2014 in his feature film debut \u2014 made the scene feel more real.",
      "\u201cAs a father, with my son Elijah playing the role, that helped kind of intensify the stakes for me,\u201d Wright shares. \u201cIt\u2019s also a little bit of this edge in there, this challenge in there, because you\u2019re coming with your hand out in a place of almost helplessness.\u201d",
      "He continues, \u201cSo, I wanted to make sure that that was done, but he was able to maintain his sense of dignity at the same time, being completely exposed to the hard facts of the danger that his son was in.\u201d",
      "Wright explains that the conversation is portrayed differently in Kurosawa\u2019s film \u2014 which follows a wealthy shoe executive named Kingo (Toshiro Mifune) whose family becomes the target of a ruthless kidnapper \u2014 because it represents the differences in social classes specific to Japanese culture.",
      "He says his character\u2019s \u201cHigh and Low\u201d counterpart (Aoki, played by Yutaka Sada) is \u201ccompletely submissive, almost to the point of he\u2019s completely powerless. I wanted to see if I could kind of right the balance there a little bit.\u201d",
      "But David remains unconvinced he should pay the hefty ransom following Paul\u2019s emotional plea and rejects him. It isn\u2019t until the music titan has a harsh heart-to-heart with his own son that he changes his mind.",
      "David agrees to meet A$AP Rocky\u2019s character, later revealed to be aspiring rapper Yung Felon, while working with authorities to set a trap. He rides the subway to the Yankee Stadium stop in the Bronx and accidentally drops the backpack containing the $17.5 million and a tracking device. Through a series of diversions, Yung Felon evades the police and gets away with the cash. He honors his word and sets Kyle free, leaving the teen bloodied and bruised in a park.",
      "What Happens at the End of \u2018Highest 2 Lowest\u2019?",
      "Although David is seen as a local hero, his fellow music executives realize that he used their money for the ransom and threaten to sue him for breach of contract. He leaves his office and decides to stroll the Brooklyn Bridge and listen to songs from artists who sent demos to the label in hopes of receiving a record deal. David, with the self-described \u201cbest ears in the business,\u201d notices that one of the tracks features an artist with the same voice as the kidnapper.",
      "When the police aren\u2019t quick to investigate his theory, David and Paul follow a tip that leads them to Yung Felon\u2019s apartment and later to a studio where he is recording a song. David, armed, goes into the studio alone and confronts Yung Felon. The young artist calls out David for not recognizing his talents sooner, blaming the exec for his lack of success in life.",
      "Washington praises A$AP Rocky\u2019s performance in their scenes together, telling TODAY.com, \u201cHe came in ready, and so did I, and we just hit the ball back and forth across the net. It was simple. It was easy because he was prepared, and so was I.\u201d",
      "The 70-year-old actor adds, \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful young artist. He\u2019s a wonderful young actor, and the sky\u2019s the limit for him.\u201d",
      "Yung Felon fires a gunshot at David before running away and boarding a train. But David is right behind him, and the two fight before the mogul gains the upper hand. Yung Felon is arrested and publicly claims he is innocent as he arrives at a courthouse surrounded by supporters. Privately, he accepts a plea deal to go to prison for a couple decades. He also has a final request: to speak to David one more time.",
      "The two sit down, separated by a glass partition, for another sparring of words. Yung Felon says his popularity has caused his song to skyrocket on charts around the world. He says multiple labels are interested in him, but he wants David to sign him. David rebuffs his offer, revealing that he no longer works for Stackin\u2019 Hits Records and is starting a smaller, independent label. Yung Felon becomes enraged as he is dragged away by guards.",
      "In the final scene, David meets with a new artist named Sula (Aiyana-Lee), discovered by his son, who wants to be a star. She sings an original song for him, titled \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d before David promises to make her dream come true.",
      "At the end of the film it's revealed the David's new label will be a family managed business."

I\u2019m not really method, but I must have really resented the fact that she still hadn\u2019t fallen in love with me. We were 17 weeks into the movie and she still didn\u2019t like me.\u201d",

      "Russia may never agree to such a concept and Trump may yet change his mind but for the moment, they were satisfied with the day\u2019s conversations, the source said.",

      "\u201cThe Jewish Bible speaks about the Jewish life,\u201d Chen told NBC News. \u201cLife comes before revenge, and that is exactly what we are asking for this government to remember.\u201d",
      "The protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday was one of dozens organized nationwide, including outside of politicians\u2019 homes, at military headquarters and on major highways. Demonstrators blocked lanes and lit bonfires. Some restaurants and theaters closed in solidarity. Police said they arrested 38 people.",
      "The nationwide marches were on the same day as a general strike called by organizations representing relatives of those still in captivity. One of those groups, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, said in a statement that nearly 1 million people had attended rallies nationwide.",
      "In Hostage Square, the boisterous atmosphere softened as former hostages and family members of those still being held took to the largest of three soundstages to demand the release of the remaining hostages. Around 250 people were taken hostage on Oct. 7.",
      "Many of the speeches, signs and prepared videos appealed directly to President Donald Trump in English, pleading with him to compel Netanyahu to \u201cseal the deal\u201d with Hamas.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s protests were among some of the largest and fiercest in 22 months of war, smaller demonstrations held on a weekly basis have yet to sway the government to end the conflict, which Netanyahu has said he is determined to continue until Hamas is completely destroyed.",
      "The prime minister and his top officials poured scorn on Sunday\u2019s demonstrations.",
      "\u201cThose who today call for an end to the war without defeating Hamas are not only hardening Hamas\u2019s position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of Oct. 7 will be repeated,\u201d the prime minister told his Cabinet on Sunday.",
      "His ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, one of the Cabinet's most hawkish right-wing voices, in a post on X called the protests a \u201ctoxic and harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas, buries the hostages in tunnels, and tries to bring the State of Israel to surrender to its enemies and endanger its security and future.\u201d",
      "Their government\u2019s approach appears to have the backing of Trump. \u201cWe will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed,\u201d he wrote Monday on Truth Social. \u201cPlay to WIN, or don\u2019t play at all!\u201d",
      "While Israeli media reported that Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir met with senior officials on Sunday to finalize the plans for the expanded operations in Gaza, it remains unclear when the country\u2019s military will begin the new offensive in the north of the enclave and in what Netanyahu has called the \u201ccentral camps\u201d of Gaza.",
      "The U.N. humanitarian office said last week that 1.35 million people were already in need of emergency shelter items in Gaza, so any armored incursion could displace hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have been uprooted multiple times during a war that has killed more than 62,000 people, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "Two children were among five people who died of malnutrition-related causes, the Gaza Health Ministry said Monday, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 263.",
      "The United Nations also warned that levels of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at their highest since the war began. Much of the aid destined for Gaza has been prevented from entering since Israel imposed a total blockade in March after ending a ceasefire. Deliveries have since partially resumed, though aid organizations say the flow is far below what is needed.",
      "In Hostage Square, some held up pictures of emaciated Palestinians, but many simply wanted an end to the fighting and a deal to free those hostages who remain in Gaza.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure that most of the Israelis are here with us now,\u201d said Keren Leibovitz, 54, whose son Tomer was killed on Oct. 7, 2023, while he was serving in the Israeli military.",
      "Leibovitz added that before Israel worked on completely defeating Hamas, the majority of her countrymen \u201cwant the war to end and they want the hostages to come back.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 As U.S. television series produce longer and fewer episodes, a new genre from China is gaining American fans by going in the opposite direction.",
      "Known as minidramas, micro dramas or vertical dramas, they are soap operas condensed into a minute or two per episode.",
      "Each show, reminiscent of a telenovela, is divided into dozens of chapters, each about two minutes long and with all the soapy elements: cheesy romance, over-the-top drama and abundant cliff-hangers.",
      "\u201cThe revenge ones, oh, my God, they\u2019re so good,\u201d California-based retail business owner Jacarius Murphy told NBC News in a video interview.",
      "Murphy is a fan of the minidramas, known as duanju in Chinese, which focus heavily on romance, revenge and fantasy. The stories tend to involve wealthy characters such as a chief executive who\u2019s secretly a vampire or a billionaire living a double life \u2014 characters often played by American actors.",
      "\u201cPeople want this fast dopamine hit, and they can snack on it while they\u2019re waiting,\u201d said Anina Net, an American actor based in Los Angeles who has worked on minidramas for the past four years.",
      "The genre originated in China, where production companies have tapped into the popularity of short-form, vertical-produced, TikTok-style video content. About half of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people consume dramas in this style, according to a report released in March by the state-owned China Netcasting Services Association.",
      "The industry made $6.9 billion in revenue last year, more than China\u2019s total box office sales.",
      "The shows are \u201cstill quite limited in genre, mostly romance-focused, with sweet, domineering CEO tropes and modern settings,\u201d said Kaidi Dai, a Shanghai-based minidrama producer.",
      "Now, having figured out the Chinese market, the same companies are expanding into the U.S., where minidramas are finding success just a few years after the failure of Quibi, a short-lived, short-form mobile streaming service. The shows are available on platforms such as ReelShort, DramaBox and GoodShort, which offers free episodes and in-app purchases, as well as subscriptions.",
      "Minidramas cost far less to make than standard TV shows and can make millions of dollars in revenue through a combination of user purchases and advertising. But adapting them to the U.S. market takes some tweaking, said Chinese filmmaker Gao Feng, also known as Frank Tian, who has a minidrama production company based in New York.",
      "Rather than remaking Chinese shows, his company hired longtime U.S. residents to craft stories that would appeal to American audiences.",
      "\u201cI believe that scripts determine 65-70% of a project\u2019s success,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cApart from werewolves, CEO romances and hidden identities, we should explore new genres.\u201d",
      "While many short dramas have been based on successful Chinese stories, \u201cif a platform cannot innovate continuously, it will face significant challenges,\u201d he added.",
      "Among the most popular shows is \u201cThe Double Life of My Billionaire Husband,\u201d which tells the story of a woman whose husband is better off financially than he appears. All 60 episodes can be viewed in less than 70 minutes on ReelShort, the California-based, Chinese-backed minidrama platform that released it in 2023.",
      "\u201cHilariously bad, oddly addictive,\u201d reads one IMDb review of the show, which had more than 485 million views on ReelShort as of Friday.",
      "The Chinese-backed short-video app has vied with TikTok as the most popular product in the entertainment section of Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "\u201cThe short videos on TikTok have laid a solid foundation for the popularity of short dramas,\u201d Yan Min, who helped organize an industry conference in China last year, said in an interview.",
      "Min said ReelShort and other companies were advertising on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok to attract new users, catering to the \u201cevolving viewing habits of younger generations, who have grown up with platforms like TikTok and are accustomed to short, engaging content.\u201d",
      "U.S. entertainment companies have taken notice of the trend. Netflix said in May that it was testing a vertical feed made up of clips from its shows and movies, while Disney said last month that it was investing in DramaBox through its accelerator program.",
      "Though minidramas seeking U.S. audiences are increasingly using actors with American backgrounds, they often shoot in scenic Chinese locations like the coastal city of Qingdao, with its Western-style villas and architecture, for greater authenticity.",
      "\u201cWe seek actors and screenwriters who grew up in the U.S. and naturally embody an American style. Then we incorporate some Chinese elements,\u201d said Ann An, a Beijing-based freelance producer for several minidramas made for foreign audiences.",
      "Turnarounds are incredibly fast in the industry as producers strive to keep costs low. An said a show can finish filming in 10 days, with a budget of under $70,000.",
      "The biggest key to the success of minidramas, though, is the cliff-hangers, which push viewers to keep paying for the next episode.",
      "\u201cThe scriptwriters know exactly where to place these cliff-hangers, and they execute them very well,\u201d said Apple Yang, a minidrama director based in London.",
      "That helps explain the appeal of minidramas even if their overall quality is sometimes \u201cunderwhelming,\u201d said Ying Zhu, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",
      "\u201cMake the dialogue real and less mechanic. Make it funny when possible and biting when needed,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cOne minute can pack in a lot of info if done well.\u201d"

      "The optics of those first interactions aren\u2019t likely to be lost on the millions of Ukrainians watching how Putin was received, and how it contrasted with their own president\u2019s reception at the White House in February, when Volodymyr Zelenskyy was harangued by Trump in front of TV cameras. Zelenskyy may be invited to the next round of talks, but for many watching this meeting between Trump and Putin, it may seem clear who has the upper hand.",
      "Friday\u2019s meeting wasn\u2019t the first time a Russian and American president rode together in the presidential limo. In 2010, President Barack Obama and President Dmitry Medvedev both rode in the Beast to have lunch at Ray\u2019s Hell Burger in Arlington, Virginia.",

      "Arab governments that for decades have been fierce advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their timid response to the extreme suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war, risking a dangerous rift with their increasingly restive citizens.",
      "As deaths from starvation and Israeli bombardment have mounted, Palestinians, their supporters and some analysts have directed their anger toward Arab rulers in the region whom they perceive as being too passive and quiet. They point to countries outside the Middle East who have publicly criticized Israel and tried to stop it from expanding its military operations in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWhere are the Arabs? The Arabs are napping. The Arabs are nowhere to be seen. The Arabs, and I\u2019m talking about the Arab rulers, have buried their heads in the sand,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.",
      "The situation in Gaza has become even more dire as Palestinians risk their lives to get food. An aid distribution system implemented by the U.S. and the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has led to hundreds more Palestinians being killed, often by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. She and two other witnesses said they were shot at, pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed.",

      "The Israel Defense Forces said that \"troops operating in the Rafah area identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops\" and fired warning shots.",
      "It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired \"hundreds of meters away\" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said.",
      "Israel also denies there is starvation in Gaza, contradicting medics in the Palestinian enclave, global aid groups and even a close ally, President Donald Trump.",
      "Some Arab leaders dependent on American aid and security guarantees are wary of angering the U.S. and Israel and see little strategic advantage in helping Palestinians, whom they may even see as a threat, experts say.",
      "Arab states have participated in airdrops of aid and food convoys into Gaza, but Palestinians and aid groups say it\u2019s nowhere near enough to ward off a looming famine. Egypt and Qatar have also mediated talks among Israel, the U.S. and Hamas, but they have not led to an end to the conflict.",
      "Several Latin American states, along with Spain, Ireland and Norway, have blasted Israel for its conduct in Gaza and threatened sanctions or a downgrade of diplomatic ties.",
      "And in recent weeks, longtime Israeli allies like France and Australia have pledged to officially recognize Palestine \u2014 a move decried by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. In late 2023, South Africa filed a case with the United Nations\u2019 top court alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "Arab states have been much less vocal, with Egypt and Jordan even cracking down on pro-Palestinian protests and activism, fearing they could turn against the country\u2019s leaders, experts say.",
      "\u201cPalestine resonates deeply in the Arab imagination,\" Gerges said. \"Palestine reminds Arabs of the subservience of their governments. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West.\"",
      "He added, \u201cI would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.\u201d",
      "Polling before Oct. 7, 2023, showed that most Arab citizens rejected normalizing ties with Israel, a sentiment subsequent surveys show has only deepened since.",
      "A survey published in June by pollster Arab Barometer found that support for such a move has collapsed, not exceeding 13 percent in the seven countries surveyed.",
      "The Egyptian and Jordanian embassies in the U.S., along with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, even with the crackdown, have allowed limited protests, though hundreds of activists have also been arrested, according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.",
      "The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 were killed and 250 taken hostage.",
      "Health officials in Gaza say that more than 61,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in the ensuing war.",
      "Many academics, including Israeli scholars, have in recent months joined rights groups in condemning Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza as genocide, a charge Israel vehemently denies.",

      "The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were among the Arab states that signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, paving the way for economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia had been set to follow, but the Gaza conflict put those plans on hold.",
      "For Gulf Arab states, better ties with Israel have little to do with public attitudes and more to do with realpolitik, experts say. The Gulf states host several U.S. military bases that analysts say help shield them from regional rival Iran and also help maintain Western access to the region\u2019s vast energy supplies.",
      "Access to Israel\u2019s vibrant tech sector has also been a draw for some Arab states, who have used its surveillance technology to stifle dissent, experts and rights groups say.",

      "Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. Arab countries could apply economic pressure through oil embargoes or restricting access to the Suez Canal and Arab airspace, but experts say such moves are unlikely.",
      "Arab countries once supplied Palestinian militant groups with weapons, funding and bases from which to attack Israel, but such solidarity proved costly and dangerous.",
      "In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the \u201cBlack September\u201d civil war in 1970, leading to the militants\u2019 eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon.",

      "Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, which has led some Arab states to distance themselves from both groups.",

      "Trump greeted Zelenskyy in the early afternoon with a smile and a warm handshake \u2014 a stark difference from the tense televised meeting the two men held in February in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump took note of Zelenskyy's more decorous look. Ditching his traditional wartime garb, he wore a dark, formal jacket with a collar.",
      "\"The best I had,\" Zelenskyy told him.",
      "\"I love it!\" Trump said.",
      "Fresh off his summit with Putin, Trump sat down with Zelenskyy to see whether they can resolve sticking points centered on Ukraine's future security and the status of territory the Russian military has seized in eastern and southern Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said later that their private meeting in the Oval Office went well. \u201cWe had a very good conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the best one.\u201d",
      "Asked whether U.S. troops would help secure a peace deal, Trump did not rule out the possibility.",
      "As a condition of ending the war, Putin has insisted that his country retain about 20% of Ukrainian territory that it now controls. Zelenskyy has said Ukraine's constitution forbids him to cede any land.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy spoke to the news media in the Oval Office before they went behind closed doors. Trump suggested he will not abandon efforts to forge a peace deal, though he conceded the Russia-Ukraine conflict has proved particularly stubborn.",
      "\"It's never the end of the road,\" Trump said. \"People are being killed, and we want to stop that. So I would say it's not the end of the road. I think we have a good chance of doing it.\"",
      "When a reporter asked whether he was prepared redraw Ukraine's map if it would end the war sooner, Zelenskyy did not answer directly.",
      "\"We need to stop this war,\" he said. \"To stop Russia, we need support from American and from European partners.\"",
      "Upon finishing the meeting, Trump and Zelenskyy went straight to another meeting with the European leaders: French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "\"We will come to a resolution today I think on almost everything, including probably the security,\" Trump said before the start of that meeting.",
      "After they finished the talks, Trump and the European leaders moved into the Oval Office for further discussions, according to a White House official.",
      "Europe looms large in any accord between the combatants. Looking to prevent future Russian attacks, European nations would be an important part of any security guarantees that Ukraine has requested as part of any peace deal.",
      "But the United States also may play a part, Trump said \u2014 a surprising admission from the \"America First\" president. If there is a Trump foreign policy doctrine, it is that he wants to extricate the United States from foreign wars and shift some of the peacekeeping burden from the United States to other countries.",
      "Yet when he was asked whether he would deploy Americans to Ukraine to help preserve a peace deal, Trump did not dismiss the idea out of hand.",
      "\"We're going to work with Ukraine, we're going to work with everybody, and we're going to make sure that if there is peace, the peace is going to stay long-term,\" he said.",
      "With the TV cameras present, the tone was far more cordial than in Zelenskyy's last visit. In that February meeting, Vice President JD Vance sat beside Trump and berated Zelenskyy for not showing enough gratitude to Trump. This time, Vance sat in the same place but stayed silent.",
      "In the last visit, Trump memorably told Zelenskyy that he didn't hold any \"cards\" and that his country was \"in big trouble.\"",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that\u2019s backed you,\u201d he told Zelenskyy at the time.",
      "The meeting was ultimately cut short.",
      "Who holds the better \"cards\" at this point? a reporter asked Trump on Monday.",
      "\"I don't want to say that,\" he replied.",
      "Trump has lately stepped up his role in ending the conflict. With an eye on the Nobel Peace Prize, he met privately with Putin at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday to jump-start peace talks. He and Putin strode down a red carpet together before a private meeting that lasted nearly three hours.",
      "Though he said beforehand that  he wanted a ceasefire, Trump left the summit without one and said he was shifting his aim, instead, toward a full-fledged \"peace agreement.\"",
      "The Trump administration's messaging has at times been muddled. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News' \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a ceasefire was \u201cnot off the table.\"",
      "Rubio said in the interview that \u201cno one is pushing Ukraine to give that up,\u201d referring to land occupied by Russia. Later in the day, Trump appeared to undercut Rubio when he reposted a Truth Social user who declared, \u201cUkraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!\u201d",
      "Sunday night on Truth Social, Trump seemed to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, as opposed to Putin, who sent tanks rolling into Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Trump wrote that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and also abandon any hope of joining NATO \u2014 one of Putin's demands.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Zelenskyy took a different stance. He wrote late Sunday on X that \u201cRussia must end this war, which it itself started.\u201d",
      "The meetings Monday give the leaders a forum to discuss future security guarantees for Ukraine, which U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff floated as potentially looking similar to NATO\u2019s Article 5.",
      "Ukraine hopes to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee, similar to Article 5's all-for-one provision, and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals. The security guarantees should be a treaty-level obligation, the source said, which require Senate approval.",
      "A challenge for Zelenskyy is to persuade Trump that Russia should give up the territory it seized by force. A European official said it was their belief that Ukraine would never give up all of its eastern Donbas region, much of which Russia controls.",
      "In the run-up to the Alaska summit, Trump said an end to the war would include \u201csome swapping of territories.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy promptly shot down the prospect, saying, \u201cUkrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d"

      "For Kyiv, the Donbas is a vital industrial hub and defensive buffer, a resource-rich region that Ukraine fiercely claims as its sovereign territory with deep cultural roots.",
      "For the Kremlin, it is both a tactical target and a political lever, with Putin framing the region as historically linked to Russia while placing it at the heart of the territorial ambitions he has pursued with military force.",
      "Its fate may now be decided in the Oval Office rather than on the battlefield.",
      "What is the Donbas?",
      "Made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Donbas is an industrial powerhouse spanning roughly 20,000 square miles, making it roughly the size of West Virginia. It is rich in coal and metal deposits, and shaped by industrial towns and strategically important ports on the Sea of Azov.",
      "After Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow-backed separatists fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, a conflict that lasted eight years and killed an estimated 14,000 people, according to the United Nations.",

      "Three years later, Russia controls roughly 88% of the Donbas region, including all of Luhansk and 75% of Donetsk, according to open source maps of the battlefield. Russia claims sovereignty over both, in addition to the southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, as well as Crimea.",
      "Russia\u2019s conditions to end the war include Ukraine ceding the territories Putin claims \u2014 roughly 20% of the country \u2014 and agreeing to permanent neutrality, including a ban on joining NATO.",

      "Why is Ukraine determined to keep the Donbas?",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed that Ukraine will not hand over the Donbas in exchange for peace. The region serves as a defensive buffer and a center of industry, and giving it up would weaken the country military and economically.",

      "All Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flights remain canceled until at least Sunday afternoon, the airline said in a statement.",
      "Hajdu\u2019s invocation of Section 107 of the Canadian labor code effectively orders workers to continue their regular duties until an agreement is reached. However, CUPE's Air Canada Component said in a Facebook post early Sunday that the strike was still on.",

      "Putin, who has ruthlessly secured unprecedented power at home, has seen his army finally eke out a slight advantage on the battlefield in Ukraine after years of brutal back-and-forth fighting.",
      "Now, invited in from the diplomatic cold, the Russian leader headed for Anchorage full of praise for his American counterpart\u2019s \u201cenergetic and sincere efforts\u201d ahead of the talks, which will see him set foot on U.S. soil for the first time in a decade.",
      "For his part Trump warned en route to Alaska that Putin would face \u201cvery severe\u201d economic consequences unless he agreed to stop the war.",
      "Asked about overnight attacks on Ukraine, Trump told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One that this ongoing aggression actually hurts his Russian counterpart. \u201cHe thinks that makes him \u2014 gives him strength in negotiating. I think it hurts him, but I\u2019ll be talking to him about it later,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Follow live updates here",
      "But many observers see Putin as likely to enter the talks feeling emboldened.",
      "\u201cPutin has scored a success already by being invited to meet Trump on U.S. soil,\u201d said  Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cTrump has facilitated Putin\u2019s acceptance back into international diplomacy, despite the fact that he ought to be finding it difficult to travel, given his status as an internationally wanted war criminal,\u201d Giles told NBC News in a telephone interview Thursday, pointing to the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court in March 2023.",
      "On the streets of Moscow, there was also a sense of positivity about the meeting and confidence in their leader, who has continually served as president or prime minister of Russia since 1999.",
      "Pavel Grebenyuk, 45, told NBC News the summit with Trump was important because \u201cthere should be a connection between Russia and America, two of the most leading powers,\u201d and \u201cthere should remain a dialogue.\u201d",
      "But Grebenyuk, who said he worked at a window manufacturing factory, added that he thought it was \u201cunlikely anything will change dramatically,\u201d after the talks to end the war, which entered its fourth year in February.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything,\u201d he said.",
      "Elena Ionova, a soloist with Moscow\u2019s Operetta Theatre, also said that it was \u201cgood that this meeting is happening,\u201d but that she didn\u2019t \u201ctrust people on the other side.\u201d She added that she was \u201cworried about Putin\u2019s fate.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, we would all like for all of this to end and end, at least, without any major catastrophes,\u201d she said.",
      "It is hard to get an accurate sense of the weight of public opinion in Russia as a result of Putin\u2019s yearslong crackdown on dissent, which has stifled political opposition and free speech.",
      "A recent survey by the independent pollster Levada Center showed that the level of support for Putin's military campaign in Ukraine remained high at 75% in Russia, but that nearly two-thirds of respondents supported peace talks.",
      "The venue for those talks is itself significant.",
      "Trump and Putin will meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a  military base that was crucial to U.S. efforts to counter the then-Soviet Union during the Cold War.",
      "It sits just outside Anchorage, the largest city in the territory,   which the U.S. bought from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867 \u2014 a sale that has since been viewed as na\u00efve by Russians after Alaska was found to contain vast natural resources.",
      "Putin aide Yuri Ushakov signaled Thursday that while the primary focus of the summit would be Ukraine, economic ties between the two nations would also be on the agenda. Putin hinted that a nuclear arms control treaty may also be discussed.",
      "Ukraine and its allies may fear Putin offering Trump other incentives to distract from his hard-line position on the war he launched by invading his neighbor.",
      "\u201cStripped of political narratives and competing interests, and based on Putin\u2019s own statements and actions, his core demands have not changed,\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank.",
      "Those demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014, although Russian forces do not fully control all of the territory in each region.",
      "Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",
      "Stanovaya added that she thought Putin intended to \u201cpropose to Trump that the war be brought to an end, and will press the point that he genuinely wishes it to stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis main objective is to persuade Trump that Europe and the current Ukrainian leadership are the obstacles to ending the conflict, and that a cessation of hostilities is possible if there are guarantees that Ukraine will not use any pause to rearm,\u201d she said on X, adding that the Russian president \u201cwill strongly promote the idea that the U.S. and Russia are two great nations that should maintain good relations regardless of local conflicts.\u201d",
      "In Moscow, Ionova, the opera singer, said she hoped \u201ceverything will be fine,\u201d adding, \u201cWe wish that this summit will be successful for us, for Russia.\u201d"

      "KHARKIV, Ukraine \u2014 Even as his family sobbed into the dirt of his brother\u2019s grave, Ukrainian soldier Artem Reshetilov warned President Donald Trump that he should not compromise with Russia during Friday\u2019s peace talks in Alaska.",
      "His brother, Andrei, 38, was killed by a Russian artillery strike while fighting to defend Ukraine\u2019s front lines. At the funeral on the eve of the talks in Anchorage \u2014 which Ukraine has not been invited to \u2014 Reshetilov urged Trump not to bend to Vladimir Putin\u2019s demands of more Ukrainian land.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to compromise with the enemy and give up our beloved land because this enemy won\u2019t stop,\u201d said Reshetilov, 46, as hundreds of Ukrainian flags, each marking the grave of a fallen soldier, flapped in the breeze behind him at this cemetery near the major northeastern city of Kharkiv.",
      "Like many who will not be present in Anchorage, he told NBC News he fears Russia could merely use a ceasefire to \u201creturn even stronger\u201d and attack Ukraine and even other countries in Europe.",
      "\u201cWe know Russia and they never keep agreements,\u201d he added.",
      "These fears are not confined just to Ukrainian hearts but shared by governments, experts and people across Europe and beyond who fear what Trump might agree to with Putin in a bid to resolve a war he once promised the American people he could fix in 24 hours.",
      "Hours before the talks Friday, Trump suggested that he and Putin would discuss territorial swaps between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 despite previously assuring European allies that he wouldn\u2019t. But Trump said that \"I've got to let Ukraine make that decision\" and that his aim was to set up future talks between the two warring neighbors.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Alaska, Trump said that he would not deal economically with Russia until the war was over. He also said it was possible Ukraine could emerge from negotiations with their much desired \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d against Russia attacking again.",
      "If Russia does not agree to peace the consequences \u201cwill be very severe,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for my health. I\u2019d like to focus on our country, but I\u2019m doing this to save a lot of lives.\u201d",
      "Follow live updates here",
      "Alarmed at being frozen out of the talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government this week turned to European leaders for a lifeline, hoping to influence the high-stakes summit and prevent a potential disaster for Ukraine.",
      "A flurry of diplomacy culminated Wednesday with an emergency video call between Trump, Zelenskyy and leaders from Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and NATO, all of whom urged the American president not to capitulate to Putin. Trump said afterward that he had assured them there would be \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d if Putin did not agree to end the war.",
      "U.S. allies came away hopeful they had steered the president away from a potential Putin diplomatic trap, but nonetheless remain anxious, European diplomats and former U.S. officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s looking better today than it did a week ago,\u201d said William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. \u201cThe Ukrainians and the Europeans were all worried that Trump and Putin would get together and make some decisions for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Even so, the apprehension is palpable.",
      "\u201cWe all are preparing ourselves for an outcome that may be highly problematic,\u201d said one European official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.",
      "So far, Ukrainian officials and European allies have tried to tread carefully to avoid antagonizing Trump. But if the talks produce a lop-sided proposal favoring Russia, \u201cthen there is no way that Europe can simply pretend that everything is simply OK,\u201d the European official said.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, the White House directed NBC News to statements Trump has made this week saying that it would be up to Ukraine and Russia to make a deal and that this meeting was merely a \u201clistening exercise\u201d that could lead to an eventual summit between the warring leaders.",
      "What\u2019s caused the most consternation in Ukraine is Trump\u2019s repeated suggestions that he could negotiate a \u201cland swap\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, having previously suggested it would be unrealistic for Ukrainians to expect the return of lands illegally invaded and currently occupied by Russia.",
      "The American president told European leaders this week that he would not discuss territory divisions during his sit-down with Putin, two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News.",
      "That\u2019s not to say opinion in Ukraine hasn\u2019t shifted. A survey by pollster Gallup this month suggested the public  now favors a negotiated solution \u2014 though the majority still reject Russia\u2019s absolutist terms.",

    "story": [
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 Toward the end of Donald Trump\u2019s first term, his national security adviser turned to him in the Oval Office and said he should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work normalizing relations between Israel and some Arab states.",
      "Another aide chimed in, saying the last president, Barack Obama, had won the award \u201cfor nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s attitude was, \u2018Whatever,\u2019\u201d recalled the adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, in an interview. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t concerned about the recognition.\u201d",
      "Any whiff of indifference is now gone. Back in office, Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of peace deals while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice.",
      "Day by day, the White House is amplifying Trump's role in curbing hostilities and putting out the message that this most combative of presidents is at heart a \"peacemaker.\"",
      "Aides have highlighted his role in settling disputes between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Thailand, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, promoting \"worldwide calls\" from the heads of several of those nations for Trump to win the peace prize.",
      "Trump is also touting his efforts to end a worrying conflict between two nuclear-armed combatants, India and Pakistan. He suggested he used trade as an inducement to stop the fighting, though an Indian official has denied that Trump's mediation made any difference.",
      "Speaking last month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president has \u201cbrokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office. It\u2019s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d she added.",
      "A difference between this term and the last is that now, \u201che actually wants it,\" a senior official in Trump\u2019s first term said about the Nobel Peace Prize, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just want to talk about it.\u201d",
      "Now comes his best shot. On Friday, Trump will fly to Alaska for a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed at ending a war with Ukraine that has produced close to 1.5 million casualties on both sides.",
      "The odds of a breakthrough are tough, but if Trump brokers a truce on terms that are fair to Ukraine, that would be a diplomatic triumph that eluded both Obama and President Joe Biden.",
      "In the run-up to the summit, the Nobel prize has appeared to be top of mind in Trump's circle. Without prompting, Leavitt  portrayed Trump as deserving of the prize in three out of her four press briefings in July. In prior months, she hadn\u2019t brought up the award.",
      "Trump has posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July. A theme of his is that while he\u2019s earned the accolade, he won\u2019t win it.",
      "\u201cThe president feels that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, but does not think he will get it,\u201d a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe has remarked that it will go to someone who writes a book about how Donald Trump thinks rather than Donald Trump himself.\u201d",
      "In a visit to the White House in April, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re was asked about Trump\u2019s prospects of winning the award, announced annually in Oslo.",
      "He didn\u2019t bite.",
      "\u201cOn that prize, that is a committee taking care of that which is completely working on its own terms and I cannot comment on that,\u201d St\u00f8re said.",
      "Trump smiled and looked across the Cabinet Room table at the prime minister: \u201cI like that question,\u201d he said.",
      "The award is solely in the hands of the Nobel selection committee; politicians don\u2019t pick the winner. But Trump has reportedly raised the issue with Norway before. Last month, he called the country\u2019s finance minister, former NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, to talk tariffs and brought up the peace prize, a Norwegian news outlet wrote Thursday.",
      "The White House official said that the president and Stoltenberg did speak, but could not say that the conversation was focused on the prize. Stoltenberg confirmed in a statement that he spoke to Trump about tariffs but would not go into further details of the call.",
      "Trump is surrounded by reminders of past presidents who\u2019ve won what is arguably humanity\u2019s most prestigious award. Obama, whose portrait hangs in the White House, won it less than a year into his presidency and even he acknowledged at the time that his accomplishments were \u201cslight\u201d in contrast to other Nobel laureates.",
      "Just a few paces from the Oval Office, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Nobel Prize is on display, signifying both the challenge and opportunity that Trump faces. Roosevelt won in 1906 for bringing an end to another Russian conflict: a war with Japan.",
      "As much as he aligns himself politically with working Americans, Trump has long been attuned to elite opinion. He takes pride in recounting that his late uncle, John Trump, taught at the acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has described his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, as \u201cthe hardest school to get into, the best school in the world.\u201d",
      "In announcing the Kennedy Center honorees on Wednesday, Trump said that he had long wanted one for himself. The president now plans to host the Kennedy Center Honors this year, teasing to reporters, \"maybe ... next year we\u2019ll honor Trump.\"",
      "A Nobel Peace Prize would be the ultimate validation.",
      "\"If the Israel-Hamas/Iran and Russia-Ukraine conflicts get resolved, there\u2019s no way that they can\u2019t give President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize,\" O'Brien said.",
      "\u201cThe Nobel committee may not like Trump,\" he added. \"They may not like his personality. They may not like his populism, but if the award has any meaning, they have to give it to him.\u201d",
      "Of course, the Nobel selection committee has its own ideas about what it takes to win. The five-member body appointed by the Norwegian parliament may be weighing other criteria apart from the peace deals the White House has tallied.",
      "In his will, Alfred Nobel stated that the prize should go to those \u201cwho shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, some longtime U.S. allies have seen fraternal bonds fray. Trump has rolled out stiff tariffs in pursuit of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda meant to create more jobs at home. He stunned various world capitals with his calls for acquiring Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize has become something of a joke in foreign capitals,\u201d a former British diplomat said. \u201cHis claims to Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc., as well as tariff wars and the assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions, incline governments in the opposite direction.\u201d",
      "What happens in the Nobel committee\u2019s closed-door deliberations is a closely guarded secret. The panel accepts nominations through the end of January and announces the winner in October. It waits 50 years before revealing even a list of nominees.",
      "Handicapping possible winners of the 2025 prize, a Norwegian think tank didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s name. The handful of front-runners the group cited included \u201cSudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms,\u201d the prime minister of Qatar, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace & Freedom.",
      "It\u2019s far from clear that the Nobel committee is susceptible to persuasion. Pressure, publicity and coalition-building work in politics, the arena Trump knows well. But the Nobel committee is insulated from that world.",
      "The prize \u201cis not something you campaign for,\u201d a Western diplomat said. \u201cThis is a decision made by people who are independent and have their own point of view. You can\u2019t buy it. Norway doesn\u2019t need the money.\u201d",
      "Last week, Trump held a meeting at the White House with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to mark a rapprochement between the two countries. Questioned by a reporter, both leaders plumped for Trump\u2019s Nobel candidacy.",
      "Nikol Pashinyan, prime minister of Armenia, said, \u201cWe will promote for that.\u201d",
      "Turning to Trump, he said, \u201cHopefully you will invite us\u201d to the award ceremony.",

But they were postponed twice on Thursday and Friday, first due to a severe thunderstorm that closed courts and then to allow time for Lai, who has complained of heart palpitations, to receive medication and a portable heart monitor.",
      "They are expected to resume Monday and last about 10 days, with a verdict by the three handpicked judges coming in October at the earliest.",
      "Lai, a 77-year-old British citizen who is one of the Chinese territory\u2019s most prominent democrats, was arrested in August 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law over his role in mass anti-government protests in 2019 that sometimes turned violent. He has since spent almost 1,700 days in solitary confinement, during which time his son says his health has declined significantly.",
      "Lai has pleaded not guilty to two national security charges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and a third count under colonial-era legislation of publishing seditious materials in Apple Daily, his now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid. If convicted, he could face life in prison.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have criticized the case as politically motivated and called for Lai\u2019s immediate release. Trump said Thursday that he would \u201cdo everything I can to save him\u201d in talks with Chinese officials, even if Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cwould not be exactly thrilled\u201d to let him go.",
      "Trump appeared to be softening a claim he made about Lai last year, when he said on a podcast that \u201c100%, I\u2019ll get him out\u201d of China and that it would be \u201cso easy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say 100% I\u2019d save him. I said 100% I\u2019m going to be bringing it up. And I\u2019ve already brought it up,\u201d Trump said Thursday in an interview with Fox News Radio, without giving details.",
      "The government of Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, said Wednesday that Lai was receiving a fair trial and accused \u201cexternal forces\u201d of trying to interfere in Hong Kong courts. Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials say the national security law and related local legislation were necessary to restore stability in the international financial hub after the protests.",
      "With a verdict still weeks away, the hearing on Friday drew fewer people than rulings and sentencings in recent cases such as the sedition trial against two Stand News journalists or the subversion trial against 47 pro-democracy politicians and activists.",
      "But members of the public still lined up hours before the hearing amid heavy police presence to secure seats in the main courtroom and catch a glimpse of Lai.",
      "First in line was local activist Lui Yuk-lin, who arrived before 1 a.m. and said she was concerned about Lai\u2019s health.",
      "\u201cHe used to have a big belly. But after many years in jail, it\u2019s now gone,\u201d said Lui, who wore a T-shirt bearing the American flag and the words \u201cLand of the Free.\u201d",
      "Members of the public gallery waved at Lai, wearing a white windbreaker and thick-rimmed black glasses, as he appeared in the courtroom Friday in a glassed-in area surrounded by four guards. Lai smiled and waved back at supporters.",
      "Western diplomats were also in attendance.",
      "During his 52 days of testimony, Lai denied allegations that he lobbied the U.S. to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. He said that while Apple Daily held anti-communist views, he did not use the media outlet to promote Hong Kong independence.",
      "Lai also referred to himself as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d at least twice during questioning, drawing fierce rebukes from the bench.",
      "Lai has already been convicted in three separate cases related to unauthorized assembly and is serving five years and nine months in prison over a 2022 fraud conviction, cases that have also been criticized as politically motivated.",
      "Spectators waved again as Lai exited the courtroom on Friday.",
      "\u201cI hope his family can stay strong and bold,\u201d Lui said. \u201cWe support him.\u201d"

    "summary": "Russia's Vladimir Putin said President Donald Trump is making \"sincere\" efforts to end the war in Ukraine ahead of their summit in Alaska.",
    "story": [
      "Russia's Vladimir Putin sounded positive Thursday on the eve of  his talks with President Donald Trump in Alaska, saying he believed the American leader was making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts\" toward peace in Ukraine.",
      "A day ahead of their summit, Putin convened a meeting of advisers to inform them \"about how the negotiation process on the Ukrainian crisis is going,\" the Kremlin said in a readout translated by NBC News.",
      "The Russian leader said the Trump administration is making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Those efforts are intended \"to create long-term conditions of peace between our countries and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,\" he added, particularly if the negotiations are extended to cover strategic offensive weapons treaties.",
      "This suggests that a deal on nuclear arms control could be part of the talks. Russia suspended its participation in the New START \"reduction in strategic offensive arms\" agreement in 2023.",
      "Earlier Thursday, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said the summit would start with head-to-head talks between Trump, Putin and their translators at 11:30 a.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) and would be followed by a joint news conference. The White House later confirmed this.",
      "Trump \"wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.",
      "The top-level Russian delegation will include Putin, Ushakov, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Putin's longtime friend and investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, Ushakov said on a call with journalists in Moscow.",
      "The primary topic of the meeting will be Ukraine, he said, but he added that he expected the \"huge, and unfortunately hitherto untapped, potential\" of economic ties between the U.S. and Russia would also be discussed.",
      "As well as Putin's openly stated goal of subjugating Ukraine, he also wants to end Russia's exile from the Western financial system following economic sanctions imposed by Washington, the European Union and others. Trump has not yet lifted these punishments but has expressed a desire to end Russia's economic pariah status.",
      "NBC News asked Trump in a press gaggle on Thursday whether he would offer Putin access to rare earth minerals as an incentive to end the war with Ukraine.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to see what happens with our meeting. We have a big meeting. It\u2019s going to be, I think, very important for Russia, and it\u2019s going to be very important for us,\" Trump said, without offering additional details. He later added that the earth minerals are \u201cvery unimportant\u201d compared to \u201ctrying to save lives.\u201d",
      "The talks come as Ukraine marked a grim new record with 286 civilians killed and 1,388 injured in July, according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cFor the second month in a row, the number of civilian casualties in Ukraine hits a new three-year high,\u201d Danielle Bell, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cOnly the first three months after the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw more killed and injured than in this past month.\u201d",
      "The Trump-Putin summit has prompted howls of dismay and anxiety across Ukraine and Europe, which have not been invited to the talks and fear what the American president may agree to with his Russian counterpart about the conflict raging on their continent.",
      "They have been confined to their own diplomatic scrambling, including dozens of calls between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders, culminating in a video call between these parties and Trump himself Wednesday.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Putin \u201cis bluffing\u201d in saying he wants peace.",
      "On Thursday, the Ukrainian leader flew to London and met his British counterpart, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for what both called a \"productive meeting.\" As well as the prospect of Britain financing the small drones that have become central to Ukraine's battlefield defense, the pair discussed the Alaska talks, \"which present a viable chance to make progress as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious about peace,\" a spokesperson from Starmer's office, No. 10 Downing St., said in a statement.",
      "After Wednesday's call with Zelenskyy, Starmer and others, Trump said he had assured them that there would be \"very severe consequences\" \u2014 without elaborating what those might be \u2014 if Putin did not agree to end the war during their sit-down discussion.",
      "Two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News that he told them he would not discuss possible divisions of territory with the man flying in from the Kremlin."
