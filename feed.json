      "\u201cSunrise on the Reaping\u201d sold 1.2 million copies in the U.S alone, more than double the pace of its immediate predecessor, \u201cThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\u201d and more than triple the number for \u201cMockingjay,\u201d which came out in 2010.

      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d is director Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger's latest documentary and executive produced by Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When filmmaker Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger reflects on ASCO\u2019s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence on Chicano art history.",
      "\u201cThat movement continues today, and it\u2019s very expansive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.\u201d",
      "He's referring to \u201cASCO: Without Permission,\u201d a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herr\u00f3n III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group \u201casco\u201d \u2014 \u201cnausea\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d in Spanish \u2014 after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles.",
      "All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way.",
      "\u201cTo behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,\u201d said executive producer Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal at the film\u2019s South by Southwest film festival premiere earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.\u201d",
      "Bernal and Diego Luna executive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution.",
      "Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Guti\u00e9rrez Senger\u2019s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO\u2019s early rebellion.",
      "\u201cI felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,\u201d said Gamboa.",
      "Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn\u2019t happened before,\u201d she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators.",
      "ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid the East LA walkouts, protesting education inequality, and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality.",
      "Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities.",
      "\u201cThe response to such violence was to create art,\u201d said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints.",
      "For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,\u201d said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled \u201cInstant Mural,\u201d a metaphor on feeling captive.",
      "One of ASCO's most known works is \u201cSpray Paint LACMA.\u201d Gamboa, Gronk and Herr\u00f3n spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, \u201cChicanos are in gangs, they don\u2019t make art.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was another era when people said, \u2018Latinx art, you know, doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a thing. It doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s not part of American art,\u2019\u201d said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.",
      "ASCO\u2019s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In \u201cStation of the Cross,\u201d the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War.",
      "In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media\u2019s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story.",
      "ASCO\u2019s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted \u201cASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,\u201d the first retrospective to present the group\u2019s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment.",
      "\u201cLatino history has always been erased,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201c\u2018ASCO: Without Permission\u2019 is a story of winning a battle, not a war.\u201d",
      "A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards \u2014 a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood.",
      "The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member.",
      "\u201cHollywood movies, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. That\u2019s what I was about,\u201d said Valdez. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.\u201d",
      "Gamboa photographed Herr\u00f3n, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called \u201cNo Movies\u201d and later inspired their satirical award show.",
      "Guti\u00e9rrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists \u2014 including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha \u2014 in short films inspired by ASCO\u2019s signature DIY style.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you\u2019re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201cWe have rich stories, and we have a rich history.\u201d",
      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d includes testimonials from respected Latino artists, including actor Michael Pe\u00f1a and comedian Arturo Castro, who have broken into the mainstream but know the importance of preserving history.",
      "\u201cOur history as Latinos is not in the history books. The movements that we've had are not in the history books,\u201d Pe\u00f1a says in the documentary.",
      "Although it often feels like progression is slow, Valdez says artists need to continue to voice their opinions and \u201cmisbehave and not ask for permission.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou do not need permission to be yourself. You do not need permission to be creative. You do not need permission to be intellectual,\u201d said Gamboa. \u201cAnd the thing is, you cannot allow yourself to be repressed or silenced and or visually curtailed from presenting works.\u201d",

      "HOUSTON -- The woman convicted of killing Tejano music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez has been denied parole and will continue serving a life sentence for fatally shooting the rising young singer at a Texas motel in 1995, the state\u2019s parole board announced Thursday.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, 64, was up for parole for the first time since the killing of the singer, known to fans as simply Selena.",
      "One of the first Mexican American artists to break into the mainstream music scene, Selena shattered barriers for women in Latin music. She was 23 years old and on the verge of crossing over into English-language pop superstardom when she was killed.",
      "The singer's family and Chris P\u00e9rez, her widower, expressed gratitude to the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles.",
      "\u201cWhile nothing can bring Selena back, this decision reaffirms that justice continues to stand for the beautiful life that was taken from us and from millions of fans around the world far too soon,\u201d they said in a statement posted on social media.",
      "In explaining the decision to deny parole, the board said in a statement that the panel found that Sald\u00edvar continues to pose a threat to public safety. It also said the nature of the crime indicated \u201ca conscious disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others.\u201d",
      "Sald\u00edvar, who is serving her sentence in a Gatesville prison, will be eligible to be reviewed again for parole in 2030.",
      "Sald\u00edvar founded Selena\u2019s fan club and was the manager of the singer\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., until she was fired in early March 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "Selena, a Corpus Christi native, was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi on March 31, 1995. She was able to run to the motel lobby, where she collapsed, and she was pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified that Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a nine-hour standoff with police. She told officers she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "More than 50,000 people lined up to view Selena\u2019s body the day before she was laid to rest in Seaside Memorial Park on April 3, 1995, just 13 days before her 24th birthday.",
      "Sald\u00edvar\u2019s trial was moved to Houston because of the publicity surrounding the case. Sald\u00edvar testified that she had intended to kill herself during the confrontation with Selena but the gun misfired.",
      "On Oct. 23, 1995, a jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.",
      "While in prison, Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, obtained her paralegal and associate degree in criminal justice. She has filed several civil rights complaints alleging mistreatment by the state\u2019s prison system, according to court records, and she also helped other inmates file petitions.",
      "In court documents from 2016, Sald\u00edvar said she was being held in protective custody \u2014 meaning she was segregated from other inmates \u2014 because prison officials were concerned for her safety due to the \u201chigh profile\u201d nature of her case. She filed several appeals of her conviction, but all were rejected.",
      "Known as \u201cthe Queen of Tejano,\u201d Selena rose to stardom and won a Grammy during a Tejano music boom in the early 1990s. Her hits included \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",
      "She opened the floodgates for a new generation of contemporary artists of Latin descent who would go on to enjoy huge popularity with mainstream American audiences. She often sang in Spanish and spoke in English, reflecting a cross-cultural identity that resonated with listeners.",
      "\u201cDreaming of You,\u201d her English-language crossover album released a few months after her death, topped the Billboard 200 and featured the hits \u201cI Could Fall in Love\u201d and \u201cDreaming of You.\u201d",

      "At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began",
      "HONG KONG -- At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began.",
      "That transformation in the city's post-colonial era has taken a drastic turn since 2020, when China imposed a national security law that virtually wiped out dissent. The law drove many middle-class families and young professionals, including artists, to emigrate to democracies like Britain, Canada, Taiwan and the U.S. from what was once a haven for free expression in Asia.",
      "But others, like Chow, chose to stay and continue to document their home city despite unclear red lines. His works at Art Basel, which opens to the public on Friday, revisit Hong Kongers\u2019 collective memories of the late 1990s and early 2000s, a time many were proud of the Chinese financial hub\u2019s vibrancy and openness.",
      "\u201cWhile studying art, we\u2019ve learned many artists faced momentous times. Since we are living through such a momentous time ourselves now, I will continue to learn from it,\" he said in an interview ahead of the exhibition.",
      "Chow is perhaps best known to those outside art circles for his witty recreations of classic movie scenes with bilingual subtitles that lead audiences to reflect on Hong Kong's history and identity. He was also in the news when he ran against pro-establishment candidates in the 2012 legislative election and the 2016 election committee race, though he ultimately lost both contests.",
      "At Art Basel, Chow's paintings revisit significant news events, from the 1997 handover and overseas trips made by former top Chinese leaders to the celebration of China becoming the host of the 2008 Olympic Games.",
      "His works center on some of the biggest news stories covered by Sharon Cheung, a former journalist and now local gallery director.",
      "In 2000, late former Chinese President Jiang Zemin berated Cheung for asking what he called \u201ctoo simple, sometimes naive\u201d questions. She'd asked Jiang if his support for then-Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa gave the impression of an imperial-style appointment. One of Chow\u2019s paintings illustrates that scene.",
      "Another set of Chow's paintings that will be shown, titled \u201cPanda,\u201d captures Jiang\u2019s personality from another side, documenting his light-hearted response to a question about pandas during a 2002 U.S. trip. He replied in English with a laugh: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am an electrical power engineer.\" Zhang said he was not a panda expert and quoted a Confucian saying about the virtue of acknowledging what one doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Chow said he included the work in the exhibition because pandas have become a trending topic in Hong Kong, where twins born last year sparked a bear craze. Jiang's response shows the characteristics of Chinese leaders back then, he said.",
      "Some 20 years later, Chinese leaders no longer have such open exchanges with Hong Kong journalists. Last year, China\u2019s government even eliminated an annual news conference by the premier, one of the rare times a top Chinese leader took questions from journalists.",
      "In Hong Kong, Beijing has doubled down on its control following 2019 anti-government protests. Many leading pro-democracy activists were prosecuted and jailed under the security law. Apple Daily and Stand News, news outlets known for their critical reports of the government, were shut down in 2021 after their top editors were arrested.",
      "The cultural sector has felt the chilling effect.",
      "In 2021, the government introduced amendments to its film censorship law on national security grounds. Some filmmakers have stopped screening their work in the city. Cultural works that diverge from government positions have lost funding. Booksellers practice self-censorship at the city's book fair, and local libraries in 2023 pulled titles related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing and some political figures.",
      "Cheung, director of SC Gallery, said people have become more cautious about expressing their thoughts, but that she and Chow will not let fear stop them. Art\u2019s sense of distance allows room for interpretation, Cheung said.",
      "\u201cWe're not trying to tell people something. It's more about what people take away when they look at these images,\u201d she said.",
      "Chow said he never planned to leave Hong Kong despite the city's drastic changes, noting that artists who lived through major changes in the past produced great work.",
      "\u201cToday, finding ourselves in this moment of transformation, how could I, as a creative professional, not be here to witness it personally?\u201d he said.",

      "The Sex Pistols will tour North America for the first time since 2003 this fall",
      "NEW YORK -- It wasn't the night punk broke, but it was close. Nearly 50 years ago, the Sex Pistols \u2014 then made up of vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock \u2014 performed at the 100 Club Punk Special in London, a 140-capacity club, alongside Subway Sect, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Clash.",
      "The event marked a shift for the subcultural movement; the bands here would soon bring their underground culture to reach mainstream heights.",
      "Now, the 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 Jones, Cooke and Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 sit in the same venue to discuss their forthcoming North American tour. \u201cThis is where it all kicked off, really, all the punk,\u201d says Cook.",
      "This fall, the legendary punk band will embark on their first tour of North America since 2003, when they were joined by John Lydon (formerly Rotten.) The 2025 run with Carter begins Sept. 16 at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas \u2014 the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones recalls having \u201cpigs' hooves and bottles and what not slung at us by cowboys.\u201d",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \u201cLive in the U.S.A.\u201d albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will release April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones jokes.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3. Tickets go on sale April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977\u2019s \u201cNever Mind the Bollocks, Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols Album\u201d live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\u201cWhy not?\u201d says Jones.",
      "\u201cI think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\u201d says Carter. \u201cAnd I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\u201d he continued. \u201cPunk is an energetic music. It\u2019s one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\u201d",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band says they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\u201cThe last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\u201d says Jones, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in their TV series \u201cPistol.\u201d The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\u201cWe wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\u201cGood luck to him,\u201d adds Matlock. \u201cI wish he thinks, maybe, \u2018good luck\u2019 to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\u201d",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\u201cWe're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\u201d says Matlock. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s got a great deal of aplomb that we\u2019re going to bring to the public over there.\u201d",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \u201cIt's early days,\u201d says Jones. \u201cLet's see what happens.\u201d",

      "An upcoming memoir by retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has a new title and release date",
      "An upcoming memoir by retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has a new title and release date. Kennedy's book also will come out as a single publication, not in two volumes, as once planned.",
      "Simon & Schuster announced Thursday that \u201cLife, Law, & Liberty\u201d will be released Oct. 14, one year later than scheduled. Kennedy's memoir was originally titled \u201cLife and Law.\u201d A spokesperson for Simon & Schuster, which first announced Kennedy's book deal in 2024, said the changes were part of the \u201cnatural evolution of the editing process.\u201d",
      "The 88-year-old Kennedy, who stepped down from the court in 2018, is expected to trace his life from his childhood in Sacramento, California, to his 30 years as a justice. He was known as a moderate conservative who cast decisive votes on same-sex marriage, campaign finance and abortion, among other cases.",

      "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order on the Smithsonian Institution that targets funding to programs that contain what he calls \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday revealed his intention to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order that targets funding for programs that advance \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology,\" the latest step in a broadside against culture he deems too liberal.",
      "Trump claimed there has been a \u201cconcerted and widespread\u201d effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \u201cobjective facts\u201d with a \u201cdistorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,\" adding that it casts the \u201cfounding principles\u201d of the United States in a \u201cnegative light.\u201d",
      "The order he signed behind closed doors puts Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, in charge of overseeing efforts to \u201cremove improper ideology\u201d from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks the Republican president's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he considers out of step with conservative sensibilities. Trump recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\u201cMuseums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\u201d he said.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \u201cWe have no comment for now.\u201d",
      "Under Trump\u2019s order, Vance will also work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn\u2019t spent on programs that \u201cdegrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\u201d Trump also wants to ensure that the women\u2019s history museum celebrates women and not \u201crecognize men as women in any respect.\u201d",
      "It also requires the interior secretary to reinstate monuments, memorials, statues and similar properties that have been removed or changed since Jan. 1, 2020, to \u201cperpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\u201d",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world\u2019s largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \u201cat Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\u201d",

      "Day 3 of the Paris trial focused on the testimony of the younger plaintiff, who said Depardieu first groped her bottom when she was alone with him for a brief moment between the backstage area and the film set.",
      "\u201cOut of the blue, he put his hand on my butt,\u201d she said, adding she was \u201cunder shock,\u201d \u201cpetrified,\u201d and said nothing.",

      "The plaintiff said she reported the issue to her direct manager, who then alerted others in charge of the film production, prompting anger from the actor.",
      "Depardieu repeatedly denied the allegations Wednesday in court, saying : \u201cI\u2019m not like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that maybe, I don\u2019t know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,\" Depardieu said. \"But I\u2019m not only that. I still respect people.\u201d",
      "The actor also told the court that he is almost always accompanied by aides on the film set, including his body guard, and suggested that he would rarely find himself alone with a film worker.",
      "On Tuesday, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with the set dresser who accused him of sexual assault. He said he grabbed her hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to. Neither women has done so in this case.",
      "The four-day trial was to continue Thursday, with the verdict expected at a later date.",
      "The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted.",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 G\u00e9rard Depardieu once seemed larger than France itself. With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, he reigned over cinema for half a century \u2014 a national icon as familiar as the baguette.",
      "But this week, the actor who starred in more than 230 films \u2014 and who inspired writer John Updike to lament, \u201cI think that I shall never view a French film without Depardieu\u201d \u2014 sat slumped on a special orthopedic stool in a Paris courtroom.",
      "He faces two counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000).",
      "But more than Depardieu is on trial.",
      "For many in France, this case marks the country\u2019s ultimate litmus test \u2014 a question not just of guilt or innocence, but of readiness. Can a nation famed for its culture of seduction \u2014 and long criticized for shielding its male artists \u2014 finally hold one of them accountable?",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping two women \u2014 a set dresser and an assistant \u2014 during the 2021 filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\"The Green Shutters\"). According to complaints and witness statements, he trapped one woman with his legs, grabbed her breasts and waist, and shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t even get it up because of this heat!\u201d before crudely inviting her to touch his \u201cbig parasol.\u201d",
      "He denies all allegations. \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman,\u201d he wrote in Le Figaro. \u201cI have only ever been guilty of being too loving, too generous, or having a temperament that is too strong.\u201d",
      "But this is the first time one of the more than 20 accusations against him has reached court.",
      "Once a symbol of France\u2019s creative power, Depardieu\u2019s career now shadows the nation\u2019s delayed reckoning with #MeToo. The courtroom has become the stage for something deeper: a country finally confronting the myths it has long told itself about art, power, and male genius.",
      "Born in 1948 to a working-class family in Ch\u00e2teauroux, Depardieu\u2019s rise was the stuff of legend. A stuttering teen with no formal education, he drifted into acting and exploded onto the French stage with \u201cLes Valseuses\u201d (\"Going Places\"), a 1974 film so provocative it remains banned in some countries.",
      "From there came a blur of hits: \u201cJean de Florette,\u201d \u201cCyrano de Bergerac,\u201d \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Last Metro,\u201d and \u201cDanton.\u201d He won a Golden Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the adoration of millions. He played Columbus, Jean Valjean, and even Ob\u00e9lix in the \u201cAsterix\u201d films. He was prolific, omnipresent \u2014 messy, magnetic, and untouchable.",
      "But the excess was real off-screen too. He crashed his motorcycle while drunk, accepted a Russian passport from Vladimir Putin during a tax dispute, and once urinated in a plane aisle. He boasted of his appetites. France seemed to cheer them on.",
      "That myth \u2014 of the lovable brute \u2014 is now unraveling.",
      "In Hollywood, #MeToo toppled titans. In France, the movement was met with a wary eye. When #BalanceTonPorc (\u201cExpose Your Pig\u201d) emerged in 2017, it rattled the country\u2019s self-image \u2014 particularly in the arts, where seduction and transgression had long been celebrated.",
      "Some warned that #MeToo was killing romance. In 2018, screen legend Catherine Deneuve and 99 other prominent French women published an open letter in Le Monde, scolding the movement for going, in their words, \u201ctoo far.\u201d They championed la libert\u00e9 d\u2019importuner \u2014 \u201cthe freedom to bother\u201d \u2014 as a pillar of French life, defending the right of men to pursue women without fear of consequence. To many, it sounded less like a defense of flirtation than a permission slip for harassment, cloaked in perfume and nostalgia.",
      "Even President Emmanuel Macron echoed the sentiment. In Dec. 2023 \u2014 shortly after a documentary aired footage of Depardieu making sexually suggestive comments about a young girl in North Korea \u2014 Macron defended the actor on national television, condemning the backlash as a \u201cmanhunt.\u201d \u201cG\u00e9rard Depardieu makes France proud,\u201d he said.",
      "The remark sparked national outrage \u2014 not just for its timing, but for what it revealed: the instinct to protect cultural giants, no matter the cost.",
      "France\u2019s reluctance to confront sexual misconduct among its stars has long set it apart.",
      "Roman Polanski, convicted of statutory rape in the U.S. and accused by several other women, continues to work and live freely in France. In 2020, his C\u00e9sar Award win prompted walkouts \u2014 but also a standing ovation. There was little institutional pushback.",
      "In 2022, Johnny Depp was dropped from Disney's \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise after domestic abuse allegations by ex-wife Amber Heard ( he was largely vindicated ).",
      "Yet, in France, he was embraced.",
      "In 2023, he played Louis XV in \u201cJeanne du Barry\u201d, the opening film at the French Cannes Film Festival. French fashion house Dior not only kept him on as the face of its Sauvage fragrance \u2014 it reportedly signed him to a multiyear, seven-figure deal in 2022.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s trial isn\u2019t the only case shaking French cinema. In recent months, a string of high-profile convictions have suggested that the shield of fame may finally be cracking.",
      "In February, director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was a child.",
      "Actor-director Nicolas Bedos was sentenced in 2024 for sexual assault.",
      "The same year, actor-director Judith Godr\u00e8che testified before a parliamentary commission, accusing two renowned directors of exploiting her as a teenager. \u201cThis is not about desire,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s about power. About silence. About a system that protects itself.\u201d",
      "That same commission has since summoned major actors \u2014 including Jean Dujardin of \u201cThe Artist\u201d fame. Some reportedly asked to testify behind closed doors.",
      "Anouk Grinberg, who appeared in \u201cLes Volets Verts,\u201d has publicly supported the two women accusing Depardieu. \u201cWhat I saw on set was not seduction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was shameful.\u201d",
      "The case has become a national mirror \u2014 reflecting everything France has tolerated, denied, and excused.",
      "On the Parisian sidewalks, opinions still diverge. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our culture of flirtation,\u201d said Alain Morel, 62, sipping an espresso at a caf\u00e9 near the Arc de Triomphe. \u201cFlirting isn\u2019t a crime \u2014 it\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d",
      "But across the street, 28-year-old student Yasmine Bensalem shook her head. \u201cWe called it charm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was always about power.\u201d",
      "The trial continues. Depardieu, who has diabetes and heart disease, attends with medical accommodations. His lawyer claims the case is a political vendetta \u2014 a plot to \u201cmake Depardieu fall.\u201d",
      "But whether he is convicted or not, the deeper judgment is already underway.",
      "For decades, France\u2019s artists were seen as untouchable \u2014 their genius a shield. That shield is cracking. The myth is dying. And in its place, a question rises:",
      "Can France finally hold its most powerful men to account?",

      "Thirty years ago, music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez was killed by her fan club\u2019s president, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar. For the last three decades, Sald\u00edvar has served her life sentence in Texas.",
      "Now 64, Sald\u00edvar has a petition for parole under review, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice online records. On Sunday, she is up for parole for the very first time.",
      "According to a spokeswoman for the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, her case will be voted on or around then, but there's no exact date for the decision to be released.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about Selena, Sald\u00edvar and the parole process in Texas:",
      "Born in 1971, Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez demonstrated an incredible vocal gift in childhood, fronting Selena y Los Dinos with her siblings A.B. and Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "Her superstardom arrived in the early 1990s, with her unique blend of Tejano, pop, cumbia and other musical styles manifesting in huge hits like \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",
      "Known the world over as The Queen of Tejano, or even more simply just as Selena, she broke barriers for women in Latin music. She opened the floodgates for a new generation of contemporary artists of Latin descent who would go on to enjoy huge popularity with mainstream American audiences. She often sang in Spanish and spoke in English, reflecting a cross-cultural identity that resonated with listeners.",
      "She won her first Grammy in 1994 for best Mexican/Mexican-American album for \u201cLive,\u201d becoming the first female Tejano artist to win the category. She was just 23 when she was killed the following year. But her legacy endures for Mexican Americans, Mexicans, Texans, Latinos and beyond.",
      "Her posthumous English-language crossover album released a few months after her death, \u201cDreaming of You,\u201d topped the Billboard 200, featuring hits like \u201cI Could Fall in Love\u201d and \u201cDreaming of You.\" In 1997, a biographical film about her life, \u201cSelena,\" would quickly become a classic, further launching the career of lead Jennifer Lopez.",
      "In 2017, she received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. At the time, according to a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spokesperson, the crowd was the largest-ever for a Walk of Fame ceremony, breaking a 1998 record set by onlookers at the unveiling of the star for Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez.",
      "In 2021, she received a posthumous lifetime achievement award from the Grammys. There was no tribute.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, was the founder and president of Selena's fan club. She was also a manager of Selena\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., but was fired in early 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "On March 31, 1995, Selena went to Sald\u00edvar's room at the Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, to pick up business records she needed for a tax filing, according to court testimony. A confrontation followed.",
      "Selena was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver in the motel room, ran outside and collapsed in the lobby. She was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead about an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a 9-hour standoff with police, during which she held a gun to her head. She told police she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "The trial was moved to Houston because of heavy publicity.",
      "Prosecutors contended that Sald\u00edvar shot the 23-year-old after the singer\u2019s family suspected her of embezzling $30,000. The defense argued the gun went off accidentally.",
      "On October 23, 1995, the jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years \u2014 beginning in 2025.",
      "Sald\u00edvar did not face the death penalty because the crime contained none of the aggravating circumstances required under Texas law, such as a multiple murder or a murder committed during a robbery.",
      "In 1999, the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin turned down Sald\u00edvar\u2019s first plea for a new trial. In 2000, her lawyer Bill Berchelmann asked the state to revisit the trial. He argued that prosecutors wrongly dismissed potential jurors because of race, did not disclose the criminal record of a witness and made improper comments in court. He said police also violated Sald\u00edvar's rights by interrogating her after she asked for an attorney.",
      "In 2009, Sald\u00edvar lost an appeal because it was filed in the wrong county. She had asked the court to order an appeal filed nine years earlier in Nueces County to move forward, but the state\u2019s highest criminal appeals court said it should have been filed in Harris County, where she was tried and convicted.",
      "She's incarcerated at the Patrick L. O\u2019Daniel prison unit in Gatesville, Texas, about 90 minutes north of Austin.",
      "In Texas, the parole division of the state\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice identifies inmates six months before the date of their initial parole eligibility and pulls their case file for review. Notice of an inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole is sent to officials involved in the trial, any victims and victims' family members.",
      "An institutional parole officer with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles interviews an inmate and prepares a summary for the board. The victim or the victim\u2019s family members can provide a written statement and can appear in person before board members.",
      "The inmate\u2019s file is then sent to the parole board and voted on by a three-person panel. The panel will vote on a case just prior to the inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date and a majority of two votes is needed for a final decision.",
      "In Texas, the board does not conduct public parole hearings. Parole release decisions are made independently by each panel member.",
      "Representatives for members of Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez\u2019s family did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment this week.",
      "A denial by the panel will include the date of the next time an inmate will be eligible for parole.",
      "Sald\u00edvar was convicted of first-degree murder, one of the crimes where state law dictates that the next review after a denial can be done anywhere from one to five years from the date of the denial.",
      "An approval by the panel could include special conditions the inmate will have to follow while on parole. Processing time for a release differs from case to case. Once a release certificate with an approved residence plan is issued, it will be audited by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s Classification and Records Department and a release date is calculated. Typically, these processes can take two to six weeks to complete.",
      "The governor cannot veto a parole decision by the pardons board. The governor, upon recommendation by a majority of the pardons board, can grant clemency. That includes pardons, commutations and reprieves.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- June Carter, Kenny Chesney and Tony Brown have been invited to join the Country Music Hall of Fame.",
      "The Country Music Association announced the new 2025 inductees on Tuesday in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Carter, the Grammy-winning member of one of country music\u2019s pioneering families and the wife of country giant Johnny Cash, joins as this year's veteran era artist. Chesney, who has won the CMA Awards entertainer of the year four times, joins as the modern era artist. And Brown, a Nashville producer who has supervised a wide array of best-selling hits by Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, George Strait and many others, will join the non-performer category.",
      "The three will be formally inducted during a ceremony in the fall.",
      "Tuesday's celebratory ceremony focused on their contributions to country music over the decades, highlighting their influence, even when they were overlooked at times.",
      "\u201cJohnny once said that his wife was one of the most neglected artists in country music,\u201d said country singer Vince Gill, who introduced the inductees. He said Cash worried that his wife's contributions would \u201cunder-recognized simply because she's my wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat changes as she takes her rightful place among family, friends and legends in the Country Music Hall of Fame,\u201d Gill said.",
      "Some of Carter's accomplishments include writing more than 100 songs, including co-writing \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a top hit for Cash. The two married in 1968 and recorded several Grammy-award winning hits like \u201cJackson\u201d and \u201cIf I Were a Carpenter.\u201d",
      "But Carter had been singing since she was 10, long before marrying Cash. Her mother, Maybelle Carter, was in the Carter Family music act with her cousin Sara Carter and Sara\u2019s husband, A.P. Carter. The family act broke up, but mother and daughters June, Helen and Anita continued on as Mother Maybelle & the Carter Sisters, with little June playing autoharp.",
      "The Carters went on to become staples of the Grand Ole Opry country music show in Nashville.",
      "Carlene Carter described her mother as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who was \u201canchored in love.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything that\u2019s good about me is because of that mom,\u201d said Carlene Carter, who continued in the family business as a country singer and songwriter.",
      "Chesney, who grew up in eastern Tennessee, told the crowd on Tuesday that if someone had said he would one day be inducted into the same Hall of Fame class as June Carter Cash, he would have called it \u201cunbelievable.\u201d",
      "Chesney's career includes 16 platinum albums and more than 50 Top Ten country hits. After receiving a standing ovation, he said he was just hoping to spread love and positivity through his music.",
      "\u201dI had a really big dream and I\u2019m still pushing that dream as far as I can,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cI just wanted to record and write songs that reflected the lives of a lot of people that came to our shows.\"",
      "For Brown, getting the call about his induction into the Hall of Fame almost knocked him over. He called it one of the biggest accomplishments of his career.",
      "Every year, the Country Music Hall of Fame chooses just three inductees, one of which rotates between songwriters, recording/touring musicians and non-performers.",
      "Brown backed Elvis Presley until his death in 1977, then played with Emmylou Harris & The Hot Band, as well as Rodney Crowell & The Cherry Bombs. But he's being honored more for his production work, as president of MCA Nashville, with RCA Records and eventually as co-founder of Universal South Records.",
      "\u201cYou make records and you make some money, but this is better than money,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis is about making an impact.\u201d",

      "The redacted footage shows deputies talking with the two workers who called authorities to report seeing someone lying on the floor inside the home. With no signs of forced entry or other evidence of suspicious circumstances, the deputies asked about the possibility of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning, and the workers said they didn\u2019t see how that could have been the case.",

      "Authorities soon determined there were no leaks that could have been fatal, further fueling a mystery that captured the public\u2019s attention.",
      "It was solved about a week later when medical investigators confirmed that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s about a week after hantavirus pulmonary syndrome \u2014 a rare, rodent-borne disease \u2014 took the life of his wife.",
      "The Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office released only some of the footage from the investigation.",
      "A New Mexico court last week granted a temporary restraining order against the release of any photographs and video showing Hackman and his wife the inside of their home. Hackman\u2019s estate had filed the petition to withhold images, citing the need to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment.",

      "The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday",
      "NEW YORK -- The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "With a budget above $250 million, \u201cSnow White\u201d had set out with higher ambitions, particularly since it returns Disney to its very origins. The 1937 original \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was the company\u2019s first animated feature, and paid for its Burbank studio lot.",
      "But this \u201cSnow White\u201d struggled to find anything like a fairy tale ending. The runup to release was plagued by controversies over the film\u2019s handling of the dwarfs, who are rendered in CGI, and backlashes over comments by its star, Rachel Zegler. The PR headaches prompted Disney to pull back on its premiere.",
      "Also working against the film, directed by Marc Webb: poor reviews. Critics were largely not impressed with Disney\u2019s latest live-action remake, with reviews coming in just 43% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "There\u2019s been a wide variance between the box-office performance of other \u201clive-action\u201d Disney remakes, but \u201cSnow White\u201d might mark a new nadir. Jon Favreau\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d (2019) didn\u2019t have great reviews, either, but grossed more than $1.6 billion worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d opened worse than \u201cDumbo\u201d (a $46 million opening in 2019) and well shy of \u201cCinderella\u201d territory ($67.9 million in 2015).",
      "Overseas, \u201cSnow White\u201d added $44.3 million for a global launch of $87.3 million. But going into the weekend, \u201cSnow White\u201d had been eyeing a worldwide total closer to $100 million \u2013 and a few weeks back, expectations were significantly higher.",
      "The result will surely add to questions over Disney\u2019s long-term strategy of mining its vault for live-action remakes. In the pipeline are upcoming new versions of \u201cMoana\" and \u201cTangled.\" A live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d launches in May.",
      "Efforts to modernize \u201cSnow White,\" though, quickly ran afoul. In 2022, actor Peter Dinklage criticized the remake plans as \u201cbackward.\u201d Disney ultimately opted to drop \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d from the original's title, and animate the dwarfs. Some right-wing commentators targeted \u201cSnow White\u201d and Zegler's casting as an overly \u201cwoke\u201d production. Delays and reshoots also ran up costs.",
      "Disney, though, has recently steered a handful of films from modest starts to enviable final hauls. The Barry Jenkins-directed \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d opened with $35.4 million domestically, but ultimately surpassed $717 million worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d will face little direct competition in the coming weeks. Audiences gave it a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cAlto Knights,\u201d a period gangster film starring Robert De Niro in both lead roles, was a total misfire. The Barry Levinson-directed film, which cost about $45 million to make, opened with just $3.2 million from 2,651 theaters. The flop of \u201cAlto Knights\u201d followed another misfire for Warner Bros. with Bong Joon Ho\u2019s big-budget sci-fi \u201cMickey 17.\u201d In three weeks, it\u2019s tallied $40.2 million domestically against a $118 million budget.",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d starring Jonathan Majors as a disturbed aspiring bodybuilder, opened with $700,000 for Briarcliff Entertainment in 815 locations. The film was dropped by Searchlight Pictures after Majors was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of assault and harassment against Grace Jabbari, his ex-girlfriend. Majors avoided jail time but was given a year of probation.",
      "The disappointment-filled weekend added to a rough 2025 so far for Hollywood. The box office is down 6.9% from last year, according to data firm Comscore, and 38.6% from 2019.",
      "With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.",

      "WASHINGTON -- On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O\u2019Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O\u2019Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January, about three weeks before President Donald Trump upended the Kennedy Center by ousting longtime president Deborah Rutter and board chairman David Rubenstein. Trump dismissed the board of trustees and replaced them with loyalists, who then elected him as chairman.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 and also Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \u201cworried about what the future might bring.\u201d",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\u201cTwain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cTwain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\u201d",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin in the Free World.\u201d",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cI think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\u201d comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\u201d",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \u201cthe Roy Cohn Pavilion\u201d after one of Trump\u2019s mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted on social media that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\u201d",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has never been particularly political. The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times. In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O\u2019Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O\u2019Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O\u2019Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows. He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Must Go,\u201d drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \u201cHamilton\u201d and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Leftist comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \u201cAll You Fascists Bound to Lose.\u201d",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",

    "story": [
      "With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations",
      "WASHINGTON -- With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is eliminating or reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations, which meteorologists and former agency leaders said will degrade the accuracy of forecasts just as severe weather season kicks in.",
      "The normally twice-daily launches of weather balloons in about 100 locations provide information that forecasters and computer models use to figure out what the weather will be and how dangerous it can get, so cutting back is a mistake, said eight different scientists, meteorologists and former top officials at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2014 the weather service's parent agency.",
      "The balloons soar 100,000 feet in the air with sensors called radiosondes hanging about 20 feet below them that measure temperature, dew point, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction.",
      "\u201cThe thing about weather balloons is that they give you information you can't get any other way,\u201d said D. James Baker, a former NOAA chief during the Clinton administration. He had to cut spending in the agency during his tenure but he said he refused to cut observations such as weather balloons. \u201cIt's an absolutely essential piece of the forecasting system.\u201d",
      "University of Oklahoma environment professor Renee McPherson said, \u201cThis frankly is just dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBad,\u201d Ryan Maue, who was NOAA's chief scientist at the end of President Donald Trump's first term, wrote in an email. \u201cWe should not degrade our weather system by skipping balloon launches. Not only is this embarrassing for NOAA, the cessation of weather balloon launches will worsen America's weather forecasts.\u201d",
      "Launches will be eliminated in Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, \u201cdue to a lack of Weather Forecast Office (WFO) staffing,\u201d the weather service said in a notice issued late Thursday. It also is cutting from twice daily to once daily launches i n Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska and Riverton, Wyoming.",
      "The Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency fired hundreds, likely more than 1,000, NOAA workers earlier this year. The government then sent out letters telling probationary employees let go that they will get paid, but should not report to work.",
      "Earlier this month, the agency had announced weather balloon cuts in Albany, New York and Gray, Maine, and in late February, it ended launches in Kotzebue, Alaska. That makes 11 announced sites with reduced or eliminated balloon observations, or about one out of nine launch locations which include part of the Pacific and Caribbean.",
      "Among regularly reporting weather stations, NOAA had averaged about only one outage of balloon launches a day from 2021 to 2024, according to an Associated Press analysis of launch data.",
      "Meteorologists Jeff Masters and Tomer Burg calculate that 14 of 83 U.S. balloon sites, or 17%, are doing partial or no launches. That includes two stations that aren't launching because of a helium shortage and a third that is hindered because of coastal erosion.",
      "\u201cThe more data we can feed into our weather models, the more accurate our forecasts, but I can\u2019t speculate on the extent of future impacts,\u201d weather service spokesperson Susan Buchanan said in an email.",
      "University at Albany meteorology professor Kristen Corbosiero looked at the map of launches Friday and said \u201cwow, that is an empty area ... That's not great.\u201d",
      "Corbosiero works in the building where the Albany weather service used to go to the roof to launch twice-daily weather balloons. It's now down to one at night, which she said it is worrisome heading into severe weather season.",
      "\u201cFor those of us east of the Rocky Mountains, this is probably the worst time of year,\u201d said Oklahoma's McPherson. \u201cIt's the time of year that we have some of our largest tornado outbreaks, especially as we move into April and May.\u201d",
      "Former National Weather Service Director Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday said the weather balloons get \u201cthe detailed lower atmospheric level of temperature and humidity that can determine whether the atmosphere is going to be hot enough to set off severe storms and how intense they might be.\u201d",
      "Satellites do a good job getting a big picture and ground measurements and radar show what's happening on the ground, but the weather balloons provide the key middle part of the forecasting puzzle \u2014 the atmosphere \u2014 where so much weather brews, several meteorologists said.",
      "All of the 10 announced reductions are in the northern part of the United States. That's about where the jet stream \u2014 which is a river of air that moves weather systems across the globe \u2014 is this time of year, so not having as many observations is especially problematic, McPherson and Corbosiero said.",
      "Weather balloons are also vital for helping forecast when and where it will rain, said Baker and another former NOAA chief, Rick Spinrad.",
      "The weather agency has been launching balloons regularly since the 1930s. During World War II, weather balloon launches in the Arctic helped America win the air battle over Europe with better forecasts for planes, former weather chief Friday said.",
      "It takes 90 minutes to an hour to fill a weather balloon with helium or hydrogen, get it fitted with a sensor, then ready it for launch making sure the radiosonde doesn't drag on the ground, said Friday, who recalled launching a balloon in Nome, Alaska with 30 mph winds and windchill of about 30 degrees below zero.",
      "Meteorologists then track the data for a couple hours before the balloon falls back to the ground for a total of about four of five hours work for one person, Friday said.",

      "British Steel says it is planning to close its two blast furnaces and steelmaking operations in the north England town of Scunthorpe, after its Chinese owner Jingye failed to agree a rescue package with the U.K. government",
      "LONDON -- British Steel said Thursday that it is planning to close its two blast furnaces and steelmaking operations in the northern England town of Scunthorpe, after its Chinese owner Jingye failed to agree a rescue package with the U.K. government.",
      "Unions called on the government to help secure the future of the company, which Jingye said is suffering daily losses of around 700,000 pounds ($900,000) despite the Chinese firm investing more than 1.2 billion to maintain operations since its takeover of British Steel in 2020.",
      "The company, Britain's second-biggest steelmaker, blamed \u201chighly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs, and higher environmental costs relating to the production of high-carbon steel.\u201d",
      "British Steel said it is consulting with unions over the the decision to close the blast furnaces and steelmaking operations and reduce rolling mill capacity, potentially as early as June. Between 2,000 to 2,700 jobs are potentially at risk.",
      "The company had sought support from the government for a major capital investment in two new electric arc furnaces, which would emit far less carbon into the atmosphere, but no agreement was reached after months of negotiations.",
      "Unions published a report last month setting out how to decarbonize steelmaking at British Steel, which would involve the continued operation of Scunthorpe\u2019s two existing blast furnaces while two new electric ones constructed on site. The plan would require an additional 200 million pounds of government support to mitigate carbon costs in the interim period.",
      "\u201cThis is a dark day for our steel industry and for our country,\" said Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community union. \u201cThe closures at Scunthorpe would represent a hammer blow to communities which were built on steel, and where the industry still supports thousands of jobs directly and thousands more through extensive supply chains.\"",
      "Rickhuss urged Jingye and the government to get back to the negotiating table and said the Chinese company \u201chave not ruled out\" retaining the blast furnaces during a transition if they can win government backing.",
      "Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government will \u201ccontinue working tirelessly\u201d to reach an agreement with Jingye.",

      "At its height in the postwar period, British steelmaking was a global leader, employing more than 300,000 people, before cheaper offerings from China and other countries hit production. It now employs about 40,000 directly, with the industry accounting for just 0.1% of the British economy.",

      "The remote Queensland town of Julia Creek, population 500, is offering about double the salary a family physician would earn in the state\u2019s capital, Brisbane. The catch is that Brisbane is a 17-hour drive away. The closest major city, Townsville, is a seven-hour drive.",
      "Prospective applicants must embrace searing heat and tropical insects, too.",
      "But the town's outgoing medic, Dr. Adam Louws, says his replacement will also find a quieter pace of life and the chance to learn skills they\u2019ve never used before.",
      "Louws was recruited from Brisbane in 2022, when Julia Creek drew national headlines for offering a salary of AU$500,000.",
      "\u201cMy mother-in-law sent me a link to this news article saying, \u2018the half a million dollar job that no one wants,\u2019\u201d Louws said. \u201cMy first thought when I saw it and I looked at it was, where\u2019s Julia Creek?\u201d",
      "Julia Creek is a sweeping, romantic slice of the Australian Outback with wide-open spaces and orange sunsets. Kids play sports and ride horses. But it\u2019s remote \u2014 high school means boarding school in the city and the nearest hospital is nearly three hours\u2019 drive away.",
      "Before Louws arrived in 2022, the town hadn't had a permanent doctor for 15 years, with a roster of visiting physicians dropping in for short stays. It\u2019s a problem that has vexed rural towns in Australia and around the world for decades.",
      "Australia has a shortfall of general practitioners of 2,500 doctors across the country, according to a 2024 government report, with the shortage worst in rural areas and expected to grow. Attracting doctors to rural Australia is made harder by the eye-watering distances between the most remote settlements; the vast country is one of the world\u2019s least densely populated.",
      "In neighboring New Zealand \u2014 where 5 million people live in a country the size of the United Kingdom \u2014 distances between far-flung towns have worsened health disparities. In the United States, 65% of rural areas had a shortage of primary care physicians in 2023, official figures showed.",
      "For Janene Fegan, the mayor of McKinlay Shire \u2014 which includes Julia Creek \u2014 that meant the town needed a good sales pitch. Fegan was involved in the local health service\u2019s campaign that recruited Louws and offered to promote the town again when the job was advertised in March.",
      "\u201cWe actually have a very, very good lifestyle and a very safe lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, there is distance to travel at times, but how many people do you hear now wanting to escape from that and go off-grid?\u201d",
      "The town was not, she added, literally off the grid: Julia Creek has electricity and broadband internet.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay forever,\u201d Fegan said. \u201cJust give it a shot.\u201d",
      "When the job was advertised in 2022, some health care analysts said the bolstered salary still wasn\u2019t enough to compensate for a solo doctor\u2019s workload.",
      "But Louws, the departing doctor, said working solo prompted him to learn medical skills that he would have sent patients \u201ctwo minutes down the road\u201d for another practitioner to perform when he lived in the city. He also fulfilled a childhood dream of learning to milk dairy cows.",
      "\u201cThe money is plenty. It is,\u201d Louws said. \u201cOne of the things that I think people don\u2019t necessarily consider enough about this job is the other things that this town has to offer.\u201d",
      "Louws applied for the job three days after first hearing about Julia Creek, following study on Wikipedia. Soon, he and his wife and four children were packing to move.",
      "When he\u2019d been in the job six months, Louws said, he knew \u201cnine out of 10\u201d people in the town by name. \u201cIt feels kind of like stepping back in time about 60-odd years,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone knows everyone.\u201d",

      "Now, families of victims are wondering whether French government officials close to Sarkozy promised to forget about the bombings in exchange for business opportunities with the oil-rich nation and possibly, an alleged corruption deal.",
      "\u201cWhat did they do with our dead?\u201d Nicoletta Diasio, the daughter of a man who died in the bombing, has told the court, saying she wondered if the memories of the victims \u201ccould have been used for bartering\u201d in talks between France and Libya.",
      "During the trial, Sarkozy has said he has \u201cnever ever betrayed\u201d families of victims. \u201cI have never traded their fate for any compromise, nor pact of realpolitik,\u201d he said.",
      "Libya was long a pariah state for its involvement in the 1980s bombings.",
      "In 2003, it took responsibility for both the 1988 and 1989 plane bombings and agreed to pay billions in compensation to the victims\u2019 families.",
      "Gadhafi also announced he was dismantling his nuclear weapons program, which led to the lifting of international sanctions against the country.",
      "Britain, France and other Western countries sought to restore a relationship with Libya for security, diplomatic and business purposes.",
      "In 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to Paris with honors for a five-day official visit, allowing him to set up a bedouin tent near the Elysee presidential palace. Many French people still remember that gesture, feeling Sarkozy went too far to please a dictator.",
      "Sarkozy said during the trial he would have preferred to \u201cdo without\u201d Gadhafi\u2019s visit at the time but it came as a diplomatic gesture after Libya\u2019s release of Bulgarian nurses who were imprisoned and facing death sentences for a crime they said they did not commit.",
      "On July 24, 2007, under an accord partially brokered by first lady Cecilia Sarkozy and EU officials, Libya released the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor.",
      "The medics, who had spent over eight years in prison, faced death sentence on charges they deliberately infected hundreds of children with the AIDS virus in the late 1990s \u2014 an allegation they denied.",
      "The release of the medics removed the last major obstacle to Libya\u2019s rejoining the international community.",
      "Sarkozy travelled to the capital, Tripoli, for talks with Gadhafi the day after the medics were returned to Bulgaria on a French presidential plane.",
      "In court has spoken of his \u201cpride to have saved those six persons.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you did not discuss with Gadhafi, you\u2019d not get the release of the nurses,\u201d he said.",
      "Accused of masterminding the attack on UTA Flight 772, Gadhafi\u2019s brother-in-law and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senoussi was convicted in absentia to a life sentence by a Paris court in 1999 for the attack.",
      "An international arrest warrant was issued for him and five other suspects.",
      "Financial prosecutors have accused Sarkozy of having promised to lift the arrest warrant targeting al-Senoussi in exchange for alleged campaign financing.",
      "In 2005, people close to Sarkozy, who was at the time the interior minister, including his chief of staff Claude Gu\u00e9ant and junior minister Brice Hortefeux, travelled to Tripoli, where they met with al-Senoussi.",
      "Both Gu\u00e9ant and Hortefeux have told the court that it was a \u201csurprise\u201d meeting they were not aware of beforehand.",
      "Al-Senoussi told investigative judges that millions of dollars were provided to support Sarkozy\u2019s campaign. Accused of war crimes, he is now imprisoned in Libya.",
      "Sarkozy has strongly denied that.",
      "Gadhafi's son, Seif al-Islam, told the French news network RFI in January that he was personally involved in giving Sarkozy 5 million dollars in cash.",
      "Seif al-Islam sent RFI radio a two-page statement on his version of events. It was the first time he talked to the media about the case since 2011.",
      "He said Sarkozy initially \u201creceived $2.5 million from Libya to finance his electoral campaign\u201d during the 2007 presidential election, in return for which Sarkozy would \u201cconclude agreements and carry out projects in favour of Libya.\u201d",
      "He said a second payment of $2.5 million in cash was handed over without specifying when it was given.",
      "According to him, Libyan authorities expected that in return, Sarkozy would end a legal case about the 1989 UTA Flight 771 attack \u2014 including removing his name from an international warrant notice.",
      "Sarkozy strongly denied those allegations.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll never find one Libyan euro, one Libyan cent in my campaign,\" he said at the opening of the trial in January. \u201cThere\u2019s no corruption money because there was no corruption.\"",
      "The Libyan civil war started in February 2011, with army units and militiamen loyal to Gadhafi opposing rebels.",
      "Sarkozy was the first Western leader to take a public stance to support the rebellion.",
      "On Feb. 25, 2011, he said the violence by pro-Gadhafi forces was unacceptable and should not go unpunished. \u201cGadhafi must go,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "On March 10 that year, France was the first country in the world to recognize the National Transitional Council as the legitimate government of Libya.",

      "Moammar Gadhafi was killed by opposition fighters in Oct. 2011, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A steady stream of illegal weapons smuggled into Haiti is fueling an increase in gang violence and leading to severe human rights abuses, according to a U.N. report released Thursday.",
      "More than 4,200 people were killed from July to February, and another 1,356 were injured, the report found. It was issued after William O\u2019Neill, the U.N. human rights commissioner\u2019s expert on Haiti, recently visited the troubled Caribbean country.",
      "While much of the violence has been unleashed by gangs who formed a coalition last year known as \u201c Viv Ansamn,\u201d a growing number of people are being killed by self-defense groups and mobs, including at least 77 suspected gang members slain in November after gunmen tried to attack a community in the Port-au-Prince capital, the report stated.",
      "It also found that the number of people killed and injured by authorities fighting gangs \u201cremained extremely high.\u201d",

It noted that in some cases, police opened fire from armored vehicles \u201cwhere people were walking or selling goods on the streets.\u201d",
      "It also said police have been reportedly involved in summary executions of suspected gang members, their families, \u201cor individuals who, when intercepted, were unable to provide identification or offer a sufficient explanation for their presence in the area.\u201d",
      "The report stated that nearly 1,000 firearms belonging to Haiti\u2019s National Police have been diverted in the past four years, and that credible sources have said officers are selling some weapons on the black market.",

      "\u201cThe use of these firearms has fueled a destructive cycle of violence in Haiti, leading to severe human rights abuses,\u201d the report stated.",
      "Detecting and seizing illegal weapons remains a challenge given what the report said was severe underfunding and understaffing at Haiti's customs and police departments, as well as a lack of resources and technology coupled with corruption and lack of oversight.",

      "Korea Forest Service chief Lim Sang-seop said \u201ca small amount\u201d - less than 5 millimeters (0.2 inches) - of rain was expected in the area on Thursday, not enough to play a meaningful role in extinguishing the wildfires.",

      "South Korea\u2019s military says North Korea sent around 3,000 additional troops to Russia in January and February in continued support for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea sent around 3,000 additional troops to Russia in January and February in continued support for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, South Korea\u2019s military said Thursday in its latest assessment.",
      "The South\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea has also been sending more missiles, artillery equipment and ammunition to help Russia and that North Korea could increase its weapons supplies further depending on the war situation. Russia and Ukraine recently agreed on a limited ceasefire, though both sides have accused each other of violations.",
      "The military equipment North Korea has sent to Russia includes a \u201cconsiderable amount\u201d of short-range ballistic missiles, 170 millimeter self-propelled howitzers and around 220 units of 240 millimeter multiple rocket launchers.",
      "North Korea has sent approximately 11,000 military personnel to fight in the war against Ukraine in its first involvement in a large-scale conflict since the 1950-53 Korean War, and the Joint Chiefs assessed that around 4,000 of them have been killed or wounded.",
      "South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service previously attributed the high North Korean casualties to the troops\u2019 likely struggles in adapting to drones and other elements of modern warfare. North Korean troops are further disadvantaged by the crude tactics of their Russian commanders, who have sent them into assault campaigns without providing rear-fire support, the spy agency told lawmakers in January.",
      "Still, Ukrainian military and intelligence officials have assessed that the North Koreans are gaining crucial battlefield experience and have been key to Russia\u2019s strategy of overwhelming Ukraine by throwing large numbers of soldiers into the battle for Kursk.",
      "The South Korean military report came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed his unwavering support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine during a meeting with a top Russian security official, Sergei Shoigu, last week in Pyongyang. State media reports said Kim and Shoigu reaffirmed their commitment to uphold a major mutual defense treaty agreed upon last year. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko told Russian media on Thursday that the governments were discussing a potential visit by Kim to Moscow but did not specify when it might take place.",
      "\u201cWe always talk to everyone about exchanging visits. We are always preparing,\u201d he told RIA Novosti.",
      "Kim\u2019s military support of Russia has raised concerns that he may receive Russian technology transfers in return, further strengthening the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military. Experts say drones are among the potential areas where North Korea might seek to acquire Russian technology and know-how.",
      "North Korean state media said Thursday that Kim observed tests of newly developed reconnaissance and attack drones this week and called for their increased production. Kim in recent months has been emphasizing the development of drones, and the tests were the latest display of his country\u2019s growing military capabilities.",
      "Photos released by North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency showed Kim observing what appeared to be a large reconnaissance drone roughly resembling Boeing\u2019s E-7 Wedgetail airborne warning and control aircraft. Other images showed exploding drones crashing into military vehicles used as targets.",
      "The agency said the test demonstrated the reconnaissance drone\u2019s ability to track multiple targets and monitor troop movements on land and at sea, potentially enhancing North Korea\u2019s intelligence-gathering operations and ability to neutralize enemy threats. The report said the new exploding drones are designed for various attack missions and feature unspecified artificial intelligence capabilities.",
      "Kim expressed satisfaction with the drones\u2019 performance and approved plans to expand production, emphasizing that drones and AI should be \u201ctop\u201d priorities in efforts to advance his armed forces and adapt them to modern warfare, KCNA said. The agency said the tests took place as Kim visited a drone technology complex and an electronic warfare research group on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Kim previously inspected other demonstrations of drones that explode on impact in November and August last year.",
      "When asked about the new reconnaissance drone, which North Korean state media unveiled for the first time, Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the North likely modified an existing aircraft to create an early-warning drone and may have used certain components from Russia. He said North Korea was possibly exaggerating the capabilities of the drone.",
      "\u201cAs you can see, it looks quite cumbersome and we assess that it\u2019s likely vulnerable to interception,\u201d Lee said during a briefing, without elaborating further on the assessment. __ AP writer Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed to this report.",

      "A panel of Brazil Supreme Court justices unanimously ruled that former President Jair Bolsonaro and seven of his associates will stand trial on five counts, including attempting to stage a coup after the far-right leader lost the 2022 election",
      "SAO PAULO -- A panel of Brazil Supreme Court justices unanimously ruled that former President Jair Bolsonaro and seven of his associates will stand trial on five counts, including attempting to stage a coup after the far-right leader lost the 2022 election.",
      "The panel will review existing evidence, potentially gather new evidence and hear testimonies. Legal experts estimate that Bolsonaro could be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison, though his actual jail time \u2014 if convicted \u2014 would be less than that due to procedural considerations.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about what will happen after Wednesday's ruling:",
      "Bolsonaro will stand trial on the counts of attempting to stage a coup, involvement in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage characterized by violence and a serious threat against the state\u2019s assets, and deterioration of listed heritage.",
      "The five-justices panel of Brazil's Supreme Court ruled based on the indictment by Prosecutor-General, Paulo Gonet. His formal accusation came from a federal police investigation that placed Bolsonaro on the top of a criminal organization that had been active since at least 2021.",
      "Gonet also accused Bolsonaro of supporting a plan that allegedly included poisoning his successor, current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and killing Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.",
      "While a specific trial date has not been set, the chairman of the Supreme Court panel is expected to outline the procedural framework in the coming days.",
      "Elo\u00edsa Machado, a law professor at the Fundacao Getulio Vargas university in Sao Paulo, explained that the evidentiary phase of the criminal case, which includes defendant interrogations, witness testimony and further procedures such as expert examinations, begins. Many of those procedures will be conducted by auxiliary judges.",
      "\u201cThen, the rapporteur prepares a report and requests a trial date,\" Machado said. \u201cAfter this stage, prosecutors and defense attorneys will present their final arguments before the court rules on whether to acquit or convict.\"",
      "Bolsonaro\u2019s defense team had requested the case to be sent to the full Supreme Court, not just on the 5-justice panel, which could drag a ruling into 2026 as all 11 justices would have their say on the case. The request was denied.",
      "Brazil\u2019s top court is using one of its two permanent 5-justice panels to put Bolsonaro on trial. None of the five was appointed by Bolsonaro.",
      "As rapporteur of the case, justice de Moraes brought the charges to the one he sits on.",
      "The other four justices are C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia, considered one of the harshest on criminal cases; Cristiano Zanin, the chairman of the panel and Lula's attorney between 2013 and 2023; Fl\u00e1vio Dino, appointed by the leftist president in 2023 after serving as his justice minister; and Luiz Fux, the court's chief-justice between 2020 and 2022, considered a moderate.",
      "Brazilian criminal law mandates that arrests occur only after a final, unappealable conviction.",
      "The Supreme Court of Brazil, being the final appeals tribunal for criminal cases involving public authorities, possesses ultimate jurisdiction over Bolsonaro's case.",
      "If the former president takes any action that hampers the court\u2019s ability to deliver its ruling, such as seeking shelter in an embassy, he could be arrested before the trial ends.",
      "Bolsonaro, who has been banned from running for office until 2030 for abuse of power and undermining confidence in the country\u2019s voting system, has denied wrongdoing and claims he is the target of political persecution.",
      "\u201cIf I go to jail, I will give you a lot of work,\u201d Bolsonaro said after Wednesday's Supreme Court's decision.",
      "Lula was convicted of corruption and money laundering by low court judge Sergio Moro in 2017, and had his sentence later upheld by a group of magistrates. He served more than a year and seven months in prison and was released after the Supreme Court changed its jurisprudence to forbid jail time for any Brazilian until all appeals are exhausted.",
      "In 2021, the same court annulled Lula's sentence as it found Moro to be biased. Moro left his position as a federal judge to become Bolsonaro's justice minister.",
      "Michel Temer, who governed between 2016 and 2018 after Dilma Rousseff was impeached, was acquitted by a federal court in 2024 in a corruption and money laundering case. He was briefly arrested in 2019 under the accusation of profiting from fraudulent contracts between state-run Eletronuclear and companies AF Consult Ltd and Engevix during his time as vice president.",
      "Fernando Collor, who governed between 1990 and his impeachment in 1992, was sentenced to eight years and ten months in jail in 2023 for his role in a corruption scheme at then state-run BR Distribuidora. The sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court last year, but Collor is yet to be imprisoned.",
      "The inclusion of high-ranking military officials to stand trial in Brazil's top court is unprecedented, as the country's transition from a military dictatorship to democracy in the 1980s was marked by a sweeping amnesty for military personnel.",
      "Four high-ranking military officials who operated under Bolsonaro will stand trial. These are former Defense Minister Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira; former Navy commander Almir Garnier Santos; retired Gen. Augusto Heleno, who headed the Institutional Security Office; and retired Gen. Walter Braga Netto, who served as Bolsonaro\u2019s chief of staff and defense minister.",
      "\"Four-star generals accused of plotting a coup are now likely to be convicted and punished under Brazil\u2019s democratic legal system,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Roberto Martins Filho, a political science professor at the Federal University of Sao Carlos and former president of the Brazilian Association of Defense Studies. \u201cAnyone who attempts a military-backed coup and fails could face consequences like what we\u2019re seeing now. They could end in prison.\u201d",

      "And U.N. spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric intensified that warning Thursday after Machar's arrest, saying: \u201cWe warn that this action takes the country yet one step closer to the edge of a collapse into civil war and the dismantling of the peace agreement.\u201d",
      "He said \"it is unimaginable that the political leaders would allow their country to go back into a state of bloody civil war and the tragedy that would ensue,\u201d adding that \u201cIt is vital that the leaders of the country put the interest of the people first and foremost.\"",

      "South Sudan\u2019s five-year civil war, in which 400,000 people were killed, ended in a 2018 peace agreement that brought President Salva Kiir and Machar together in a unity government. Machar is one of the five vice presidents in the country.",
      "Machar was \u201cin confinement by the government\u201d and his life was \u201cat risk,\u201d opposition spokesperson Pal Mai Deng said in a video address to the media Wednesday night.",
      "Tensions have been increasing between Kiir and Machar\u2019s parties and escalated in March when the White Army, an armed group loyal to Machar, overran an army base in Upper Nile state and attacked a U.N helicopter.",
      "The government responded with airstrikes, warning any civilian in the area where the army group is based to vacate or \u201cface consequences.\u201d",
      "More than a dozen people have died since the airstrikes started in mid-March and the UN warned of a renewed civil war if the leaders do not put the country\u2019s interests first.",
      "\u201cTonight, the country\u2019s leaders stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict or taking the country forward towards peace, recovery and democracy in the spirit of the consensus that was reached in 2018 when they signed and committed to implementing a Revitalized Peace Agreement,\u201d Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday night.",
      "An opposition official described 20 heavily armed vehicles arriving at Machar's home where he was arrested alongside his wife.",
      "\u201cHis bodyguards were disarmed, and an arrest warrant was delivered to him under unclear charges,\u201d said Reath Muoch Tang, an official in the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Army - In Opposition.",
      "The African Union Commission's chair, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, said he would deploy a team to Juba \u201cas part of efforts to de-escalate the situation.\u201d",
      "In a statement on X, the U.S. State Department's bureau of African affairs urged Kiir to reverse the house arrest and \u201cprevent further escalation of the situation.\"",

      "ASSISI, Italy -- Pilgrims have been pouring into this medieval hilltop town to venerate not only two of the Catholic Church\u2019s most celebrated saints, Francis and Clare, but its newest \u2014 Carlo Acutis, the first millennial saint, who will be canonized on April 27.",
      "\u201cSt. Francis, St. Clare, of course, important saints who marked an epoch \u2013 but that\u2019s far removed from today\u2019s teens. Carlo is like the kids,\u201d said Maria Rosario Riccio, a mother and educator who was visiting Acutis\u2019 shrine recently with a 50-strong parish youth group from southern Italy. \u201cHe\u2019s a near-saint of our time, who can show teens that it\u2019s possible to love Jesus while being a regular youth.\u201d",
      "The group lined up to enter the Santuario della Spogliazione \u2014 a somber church, also known as Santa Maria Maggiore, marking the spot where more than 800 years ago St. Francis renounced his family\u2019s wealth. There, they prayed by the monument where Acutis\u2019 body is on view, wearing jeans, a sweatshirt and sneakers.",
      "On that Saturday, hundreds filed past \u2014 a priest and his parishioners from the Azores islands, a nun from Colombia and her Passionist sisters, a family with two teens from near Venice. Some clutched rosaries, others took selfies or touched the protective glass in front of the seemingly sleeping young man, who died of leukemia at 15 in 2006 and is generating a devotion that astonishes even Assisi\u2019s bishop.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m seeing here a volcano of grace erupting \u2026 I can\u2019t believe my eyes,\u201d said the Rev. Domenico Sorrentino. When he became bishop two decades ago, the church next to his residence just off the main street was \u201cforgotten\u201d by the throngs that visited the monumental Basilica of St. Francis.",

      "The teen\u2019s happy image, usually in a red polo shirt and carrying a backpack, is as popular in souvenir shops across town as Francis in his simple brown habit.",
      "One store owner picked up a blessed icon the first time she went to the shrine and keeps it glued to her cash register.",
      "\u201cI was really curious about this new saint who attracts youth,\u201d Silvia Balducci said.",
      "Both the church and his family describe Acutis as an exceptionally devout but otherwise regular Italian boy, who\u2019s working miracles after his untimely death precisely by drawing youth to faith when most of his contemporaries are abandoning organized religion.",
      "\u201cCarlo wasn\u2019t an alien, he was a normal person. But if it\u2019s illuminated by the light of Christ, a life becomes extraordinary,\u201d his mom, Antonia Salzano Acutis, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe always pray to the saints, and in the end, what did saints do? They opened the doors of their lives to Christ.\u201d",
      "She quoted one of her son\u2019s favorite phrases: \u201c\u2019Everyone is born an original, but many die photocopies.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe saint is one who didn\u2019t die like a photocopy, who realized that project of holiness that God established in eternity for each of us, as we all should,\u201d she said.",
      "Not an observant Catholic herself when she had him, Acutis used to joke with her husband that their young son was \u201ca little Buddha\u201d because of his unselfishness, attention to others, and cheerful obedience.",
      "He developed a precocious interest in faith, such as wanting to enter every church to \u201csay hi\u201d to Jesus and Mary. Later, he started attending Mass, adoring the Blessed Sacrament and praying the rosary daily \u2014 while also entertaining with jokes his friends who were less interested in religion and more into going to nightclubs with their girlfriends and smoking an occasional joint.",
      "\u201cThis was a bit of a way of hiding his faith life, because Carlo knew that his friends couldn\u2019t understand,\u201d his mother said. \u201cBut Carlo was a witness, a silent witness through the value of friendship, through the value of generosity, helping his classmates in school, defending the teens who were bullied.\u201d",
      "Acutis often helped the homeless and was uninterested in the trappings common for a wealthy child in Milan, one of Europe\u2019s fashion and business capitals. He asked his parents to donate to the poor what they would have spent for a second pair of sneakers for him, and insisted he wanted to teach catechism at his parish instead of going on skiing holidays at fancy resorts like his peers.",
      "That denial of privilege is a parallel with St. Francis, to whom Acutis was so devoted that he asked to be buried in Assisi, said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who spent most of his religious career there and heads the pontifical committee for World Children\u2019s Day.",
      "\u201cAnd there are more similarities with St. Francis. St. Francis left the churches and went to the squares to preach. Carlo Acutis prophetically realized that today the public squares are online, on the Web,\u201d Fortunato said. \u201cThat\u2019s where youth are, that\u2019s where people are, so he lives and brings the Gospel in those squares. That\u2019s one of the reasons why he will become the patron of the Web, Internet and social media.\u201d",
      "Particularly devout to the eucharist and wanting to share the Catholic belief that Jesus is literally present in it, Acutis created an online exhibit about miracles where the bread and wine became flesh and blood throughout the centuries. It\u2019s been used in thousands of parishes worldwide, his mother said.",
      "For her, his being \u201ca bridge to Jesus\u201d \u2014 even in his terminal illness, which he faced without complaining, certain of eternal life \u2014 is a more important legacy than any miracles or supernatural signs.",
      "To become a saint, however, miracles do need to be attested. One in Acutis\u2019 canonization process was the healing of a Costa Rican student from a bicycle accident in Italy after her mother prayed to him, Sorrentino said.",
      "Sabina Falcetta goes often to Acutis\u2019 shrine from the nearby city of Perugia with a group of fellow mothers to pray for their children.",
      "\u201cCarlo Acutis gives us peace,\u201d she said. \u201cMost importantly he gives us the certainty that God is a good father. And you can\u2019t ask for more.\u201d",
      "As she talked outside the sanctuary, a Confirmation group from Lake Garda in northern Italy was praying in a circle by a cutout of Acutis in his jeans and backpack standing by a larger-than-life monstrance.",
      "One of the catechists, Veronica Abraham, said she had been teaching about both St. Francis and Acutis, focusing on the teen\u2019s charity and his custom of sitting down to chat with anyone who looked lonely, \u201csince even a ciao is important for those who are alone.\u201d",
      "Her son Mario Girardi, 13, said he was really struck by the fact that Acutis \u2014 when only a couple of years older than him \u2014 \u201cspoke with everyone, didn\u2019t let anything bother him but helped everyone.\u201d",
      "While he\u2019s not considering the priesthood, Girardi does go to church every Sunday and plans to \u201calways stay in this mindset\u201d \u2014 maybe even going to daily Mass.",
      "Would he want to become a saint, too?",
      "\u201cWell, let\u2019s hope. Yes, right? Never say never, who knows,\u201d the boy said, grinning.",

      "Ukraine\u2019s allies from across Europe have gathered for talks in Paris about how to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand and its military as it pushes for a ceasefire with Russia",
      "PARIS -- Ukraine\u2019s allies from across Europe gathered for talks in Paris on Thursday about how to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand and its military as it pushes for a ceasefire with Russia, and to consider proposals to deploy European troops in the country in tandem with any peace deal.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the leaders of nearly 30 countries plus NATO and European Union chiefs. The summit comes at a crucial juncture in the more than three-year war, with intensifying diplomatic efforts to broker ceasefires, driven by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to end the fighting.",
      "But the conflict is raging on. Russian drone attacks overnight before the leaders met in the luxury of the French presidential palace injured more than 20 people, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "U.S.-brokered agreements this week to safeguard shipping in the Black Sea and halt long-range strikes on energy infrastructure were greeted as a first step toward peace. But Ukraine and Russia have disagreed over the details and accused each other of deal violations, foreshadowing a long and contentious process ahead.",
      "France and Britain are pushing a separate initiative to build a coalition of nations willing in one way or another to support the deployment of a European armed force in Ukraine, with the aim of securing any peace deal by dissuading Russia from attacking the country again.",
      "Some European countries are more comfortable with a potential deployment than others \u2014 not least because a big unknown is whether Trump would allow U.S. forces and intelligence agencies to back up any European contingent with air and logistical support and other assistance.",
      "Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent \u2014 British officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops \u2014 would also be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming. There would also be questions to resolve about who would command the force and how it might respond to a major violation by Russia of any peace agreement.",
      "The office of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who's driving the European initiative together with Macron, said military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details of how such a force might be put together, examining \u201cthe full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.\u201d",
      "In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on European nations to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, dating back to his first presidency, the proposed contingent is also seen as a test of Europe\u2019s ability to defend itself and its interests.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a picture from inside the summit of him and other leaders standing together with the caption: \u201cEurope knows how to defend itself. We must prove it.\u201d",
      "Macron said Wednesday that the proposed European force could deploy to \u201cimportant towns, strategic bases\u201d in Ukraine and that it could \u201crespond\u201d to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one.",
      "Macron didn\u2019t specify what sort of response he envisaged. But he suggested that a Russian attack might not go unanswered, even though the European troops wouldn't be deployed to the frontlines.",
      "\u201cIf there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it\u2019s our usual framework of engagement,\u201d Macron said. \u201cOur soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.",
      "\u201cSo we are not on the frontlines, we don\u2019t go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It\u2019s a pacifist approach,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.\u201d",
      "As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine's allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv's hand militarily. Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression.",
      "Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support.",
      "Russian drone attacks overnight injured at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a frontline community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.",
      "Zelenskyy said the attacks were further evidence that the U.S. and Europe should not ease sanctions on Moscow.",
      "\u201cRussia is killing every day and prolonging this war,\u201d Zelenskyy said on social media. \u201cThe American proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table for half a month now.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 The most destructive wildfires ever to hit South Korea were almost contained, authorities announced Friday, after rain and cooler temperatures helped fire crew put out the blazes that have killed 28 people and razed vast swaths of land since last week.",
      "In a televised briefing, Korea Forest Service chief Lim Sang-seop said that all main fires at four of the hardest-hit areas in the southeast have been fully contained.",
      "The forest service\u2019s website shows efforts to extinguish the wildfires remain at only one place as of Friday afternoon. The government\u2019s disaster response team earlier said that wildfires at other sites have been put out.",
      "\u201cAs we've completed works to contain main fires, we're turning into a system to deal with small fires,\u201d Lim said. \u201cThere are still dangers of breakouts of another wildfires so we won't loosen our vigilance and will make all-out efforts to prevent them.\u201d",
      "The raging inferno, fueled by windy and dry conditions, has destroyed thousands of houses, factories, vehicles and other structures since last Friday, while mountains and hills were stripped to a carpet of smoldering ashes. But light rain that began Thursday night and subsequent cooler weather have helped fire-fighting efforts.",
      "\u201cHazes have been diminished because of the rain last night, so that\u2019s favorable for securing visibility. Also temperatures are now lower than the last few days, so things are very favorable to put out the wildfires,\u201d Lim said in an earlier briefing Friday.",
      "Authorities mobilized about 9,000 people, 125 helicopters and hundreds of other vehicles Friday to battle the wildfires.",
      "Firefighters \u2014 many in their 60s, a reflection of one of the world\u2019s fastest-aging populations \u2014 navigated forests in yellow helmets and red protective suits, spraying suppressants at flames that flickered near their feet. Helicopters dropped buckets of water over hills that glowed red in the night.",
      "Residents hunkered down in temporary shelters in places like schools and gyms, but the fire crept dangerously close to some of them too. A video shared by one evacuee shows blazes approaching a school soccer field under a sky choked with smoke.",
      "\u201cI just kept crying this morning,\u201d said 79-year-old Seo Jae Tak, an evacuee at a gym in Andong city, on Thursday. \u201cWhen I went back yesterday, the entire mountain had turned to ashes. It\u2019s just unbelievable, I can\u2019t even put it into words. All I can do is cry.\u201d",
      "The wildfires have burned 47,860 hectares (118,265 acres) of land, forced more than 30,000 people to flee their homes and injured 37 others since last Friday. Officials said Friday that 8,000 residents remained at temporary shelters.",
      "While it's hard to link any one event to climate change, officials and experts say that it is making wildfires more likely and more severe. Scientists have already warned the warming atmosphere around the world is driving ever more extreme weather events, including deadly wildfires, flooding, droughts, hurricanes and heat waves that are causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "\u201cWe must completely overhaul our wildfire response strategy in the face of extreme climate conditions,\u201d said Lee Cheol-woo, governor of North Gyeongsang Province.",
      "Lee noted that the past week has shown how wildfires can quickly overwhelm the country's resources. He said he would request that the government establish better evacuation guidelines, adopt more powerful firefighting tools including aircraft equipped with water cannons, and adopt other approaches to improve firefighting efforts during nighttime hours.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the equipment for firefighting at night,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIn the night, firefighting is done solely with manual efforts, but with the increased density of our forests compared to the past, it\u2019s difficult to manage with just that.\u201d",
      "The people killed were mostly in their 60s or older. They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a fire Wednesday and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames. Officials say older people found it difficult to evacuate quickly but have not provided details of the civilian dead.",

Among them were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\u201d: a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.",

      "ISTANBUL -- A fire at a closed ski resort hotel in northwest Turkey killed one person Thursday, two months after a blaze at another Turkish winter resort left 79 dead.",
      "The Kervansaray Hotel in Uludag, Bursa province, was empty of guests when the fire started at 5:30 a.m. but staff were present, Bursa Mayor Mustafa Bozbey said. Three people suffering smoke inhalation were hospitalized.",
      "The 30-year-old hotel was shut following inspections conducted after the Grand Kartal Hotel fire in nearby Bolu province in January, Halk TV and other outlets reported.",
      "TV images showed flames quickly engulfing the six-story hotel, on the slopes of one of Turkey\u2019s most popular ski destinations less than a three-hour drive from Istanbul.",
      "Fire crews brought the blaze under control within two hours but not before the upper floors had been gutted.",
      "Bozbey said the fire began in the cafeteria. The fire in Bolu also started in the hotel dining area. The state-run Anadolu news agency on Wednesday reported fresh arrests relating to the Bolu fire, taking the number of people in detention awaiting trial to 28.",

      "U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife will be visiting an American military base in Greenland",
      "NUUK, Greenland -- U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are due to visit an American military base in Greenland on Friday in a trip that was scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danes who were irked that the original itinerary was planned without consulting them.",
      "The couple's revised trip to the semi-autonomous Danish territory comes as relations between the U.S. and the Nordic country have soured after U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly suggested that the United States should in some form control the mineral-rich territory of Denmark \u2014 a traditional U.S. ally and NATO member.",
      "Friday's one-day visit to the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, has removed the risk of potentially violating diplomatic custom by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. It will also reduce the likelihood that Vance and his wife will cross paths with residents angered by Trump\u2019s annexation announcements.",
      "Ahead of the visit, four of the five parties elected to Greenland's parliament earlier this month agreed to form a new, broad-based coalition government, banding together to resist Trump's designs on the territory.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Tuesday that the visit, which was originally set for three days, created \u201cunacceptable pressure.\" On Thursday she was cited by Danish public broadcaster DR as saying: \u201cWe really want to work with the Americans on defense and security in the kingdom. But Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.\u201d",
      "Initially, Usha Vance had announced a solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut. Her husband then subsequently said he would join her on that trip, only to change that itinerary again \u2014 after protests from Greenland and Denmark \u2014 to a one-day visit of the couple to the military post only.",
      "Nonetheless, in an interview on Wednesday, Trump repeated his desire for U.S. control of Greenland. Asked if the people there were \u201ceager\u201d to become U.S. citizens, Trump said he didn\u2019t know \u201cbut I think we have to do it, and we have to convince them.\u201d",
      "Inhabitants of Greenland's capital, Nuuk \u2014 which is about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) south of Pituffik \u2014 voiced concern about Vance's visit and the U.S. interest in their island.",
      "Cora H\u00f8y, 22, said Vance was \u201cwelcome if he wants to see it but of course Greenland is not for sale.\u201d She added that \u201cit\u2019s not normal around here\u201d with all the attention Greenland is getting. \"I feel now every day is about (Trump) and I just want to get away from it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all a bit crazy. Of course the population here is a bit shook up,\u201d said 30-year-old Inuk Kristensen. \"My opinion is the same as everyone\u2019s: Of course you don\u2019t do things this way. You don\u2019t just come here and say that you want to buy the place.\u201d",
      "As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.",
      "During his first term, Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world\u2019s largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn\u2019t for sale. The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Trump\u2019s plans.",
      "Vance has several times criticized long-standing European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonizing partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the U.S.",
      "Opponents of Trump's plans to control Greenland announced a rally in front of the American embassy in the Danish capital for Saturday, DR reported Thursday.",

      "BEIJING -- France's foreign affairs minister said Friday that France and China are making progress toward resolving a trade dispute over cognac imports.",
      "Jean-Noel Barrot said the conclusions of a Chinese investigation that could potentially lead to the permanent implementation of provisional customs duties on European cognac imports have been delayed by three months, until June.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be really pleased when the problem is behind us. And it\u2019s clear that, step by step, we\u2019re moving towards a resolution,\" Barrot said.",
      "China announced last year provisional tariffs of 30.6% to 39% on Remy Martin and other European brandies after a majority of European Union countries approved duties on electric vehicles made in China.",
      "The brandy tariffs are provisional and require importers to make a deposit with the Chinese customs agency for the amount of the tariff. The move followed a preliminary finding by China\u2019s Commerce Ministry that European brandy was being dumped in China, threatening \u201csubstantial damage\u201d to domestic producers.",
      "\u201cThe risk faced by the industry until yesterday was that definitive application would be made at the end of the investigation period,\" Barrot said. \"Following this visit, I received confirmation that the investigation has been postponed by three months, which rules out the scenario of a sudden application of definitive duties on this sector.\u201d",
      "According to the sector, China is the largest consumer market for cognac by value. Experts said the imposition of definitive duties would affect 70,000 direct and indirect jobs, 270 cognac houses, and 4,400 winegrowers.",
      "China has opened a series of anti-dumping investigations into European brandy, pork and dairy products. The brandy probe was the first and targeted mainly French makers of cognac and similar spirits such as Armagnac.",
      "Barrot said the investigation will be closed after three months, and that the Chinese authorities will make decisions based on the results.",
      "\u201cEveryone will continue to work together to put this dispute behind us so that we can move forward on a sound basis,\u201d he said.",

      "Lebanon has appointed asset manager Karim Souaid to the post of central bank governor Thursday as the government tries to reform the economy after months of war and decades of mismanagement and corruption",
      "BEIRUT -- Lebanon appointed asset manager Karim Souaid to the post of central bank governor Thursday as the government tries to reform the economy after months of war and decades of mismanagement and corruption.",
      "The country's economy has been in crisis for five years and desperately needs reforms to unlock international aid, and on top of that, Israel\u2019s 14-month war with Hezbollah caused what the World Bank estimates was $11 billion in damages and economic losses.",
      "The appointment was announced by Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, the International Court of Justice jurist who was named Lebanon\u2019s premier in January following the election of President Joseph Aoun earlier that month.",
      "Salam said that Souaid was chosen by more than two-thirds of the 24 members of Lebanon's reformist Cabinet, though the prime minister said he himself did not support the decision. \u201cThe Lebanese have asked us for reforms and we insist on reforms,\u201d Salam told reporters after the government meeting.",
      "Souaid, an asset manager who previously was a senior executive at HSBC bank, is seen by critics as being sympathetic to the stance on economic reform taken by the country's banks, and fear he might sell what\u2019s left of Lebanon\u2019s state assets to bail them out.",
      "An unproductive economy and decades of corruption by Lebanon\u2019s political and financial leaders that drained state resources eventually led to a run on the banks in 2019. Covid-19, the massive Beirut Port blast in August 2020 and the monthlong Israel-Hezbollah war furthered compounded the country\u2019s economic woes.",
      "Lebanon has been running on a cash economy, with most of its electricity coming from private suppliers, leading to inflation and pulling almost half the population into poverty, according to the World Bank.",
      "The country has struggled to reach an International Monetary Fund-approved deal to unlock aid to make the economy viable again, with the international financial institution asking Lebanon to end waste, crack down on corruption and financial crimes, and restructure its banking sector.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s commercial banks have been hesitant to implement some of these reforms, as it would burden them with the country\u2019s tens of billions of dollars in economic losses, experts and activists say. The banks believe the state should carry most of that burden, blaming them for defaulting on paying back the state\u2019s massive debt in 2020 and for its wasteful spending.",
      "Souaid had the backing of President Aoun, while Salam and a handful of ministers have remained skeptical of him.",
      "\u201cKarim Souaid was not my candidate and I abstained with some ministers because of my concerns regarding the rights of depositors,\u201d Salam told reporters after the Cabinet meeting, referring to concerns that large amounts of bank deposits might not be given back to depositors. \u201cHe will have to abide by the financial policy of our reformist Cabinet.\u201d",
      "Souaid succeeds Riad Salameh, the embattled former governor of 30 years whose term ended with several international corruption cases lodged against him and for embezzlement and other financial crimes. Salameh was appointed in 1993, when Lebanon was scrambling to bounce back after a 15-year civil war.",
      "Salameh, who is currently in detention, was heralded as a financial genius for preventing hyperinflation and keeping the Lebanese currency stable through years of political tensions and conflict, and then left his post widely perceived as a key architect of the country\u2019s financial downfall.",

    "summary": "If you know or suspect you can&rsquo;t pay the taxes you owe this tax season, you should still file a return with that information, or file for an extension",
    "story": [
      "If you know or suspect you can\u2019t pay the taxes you owe this tax season, you should still file a return with that information, or file for an extension",
      "NEW YORK -- If you know or suspect you can't pay the taxes you owe this tax season, you should still file a return with that information or file for an extension. That's the top piece of advice that tax professionals want you to know.",
      "\u201cThe IRS wants to work with you,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals. \u201cBut if you're asking the IRS for some help, they have to know something about you. So the first thing is to have that return filed. The number one takeaway is that owing money is not a reason not to file.\u201d",
      "If you don't file a return or ask for an extension, then interest and penalties begin to accrue immediately. Those costs are largely avoidable if you share the information about your circumstances with the IRS in a timely way. Filing a return without paying taxes owed in full is preferable to not filing.",
      "To be clear, if you don't pay all the taxes you owe by the April 15 filing deadline, interest will accrue even if you've been granted an extension to October, but that interest will be more manageable than fees that add up when you pay no taxes at all.",
      "\u201cThe worst case scenario is that you don\u2019t file and end up being liable for penalties later on,\u201d said Emily DiVito, senior advisor for economic policy at the nonprofit Groundwork Collaborative and former U.S. Treasury advisor. \u201cThat\u2019s not good for anyone. But there are opportunities to ask for extensions and to go on payment plans.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In addition to tacking on interest and penalties, the IRS can eventually garnish your wages, place a lien on your property, or even place a hold on your passport. But if you file for an extension, or if you file your return with your financial information, you can avoid these consequences. Even if you don't have the money to pay what you owe in full by April 15, paying just a small part when you file.",
      "Yes. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites across the country are staffed with volunteers who will help you file a return or arrange for an extension for free. These volunteers can help you set up an installment payment plan of as many as 72 months to pay off any owed taxes. The IRS Direct File program is also free to use.",
      "\u201cWhile the question mark when you go to click the button to pay can be intimidating, we want to make sure that taxpayers get the money you\u2019re owed, too,\u201d said DiVito. \u201cMost taxpayers \u2014 certainly most working taxpayers \u2014 get money back. But the way that a lot of the tax credits function, you only get that refund if you file your taxes in the first place.\u201d",
      "If you've experienced unusual hardship, and you share that with the IRS, the IRS can sometimes put your account in \u201ccurrently-not-collectible\u201d status. To do that, you share information about your income and living expenses, and the IRS determines if you qualify.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve been ill, and you lost your job from illness, and you have serious medical bills. You\u2019ve had all the bad luck, and things happened outside of your control, and you need some relief,\u201d said O\u2019Saben. \u201cThen the IRS can place you in uncollectable status. But all of this requires conversation and communication. No one wants to admit they\u2019re having economic problems, but the IRS will work with you if you do.\u201d",
      "There are also rare circumstances in which the IRS will settle your tax debt for less than the amount owed, called an \u201coffer in compromise.\u201d VITA tax professionals can also help you see if you're eligible, or you can use a free IRS tool online.",
      "That's OK. Start now.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been doing taxes for more than 35 years,\u201d said O'Saben. \u201cThe number one reason people don't file is that they have a feeling they may owe \u2014 which could be wrong \u2014 and they don\u2019t want to face it. But it's not a problem that's going to go away. So tell the IRS the truth of the situation. And they will work with you.\u201d",
      "Miklos Ringbauer, a CPA and tax professional in California, echoed this.",
      "\u201cIt's perfectly okay,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IRS deals with every single taxpayer. They have dealt with this before. There's nothing they haven't seen.\u201d",

Millions of Syrians, like Al-Ahmad and her family, can\u2019t afford to pay hefty fees for private generator services or install solar panels.",

      "Even with a recent gas deal with Qatar and an agreement with Kurdish-led authorities that will give them access to Syria's oil fields, the country spends most of its days with virtually no power. Reports of oil shipments coming from Russia, a key military and political ally of Assad, shows the desperation.",

      "Political economist Karam Shaar said 85% of the country\u2019s oil production is based in those areas, and Syria once exported crude oil in exchange for refined oil to boost local production, though the fields are battered and bruised from years of conflict.",

      "BEIJING -- In an address to major global business leaders, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged foreign investors to have faith in China\u2019s business prospects, the latest move to revive the world\u2019s second-largest economy that has been dragged down by a property bust and a loss of momentum.",
      "\u201cChina has always been and will certainly be an ideal, safe and promising investment destination for foreign investors,\u201d Xi told executives, including Akio Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, Lee Jae-yong, chairman of Samsung Electronics and Stephen Allen Schwarzman, CEO of investment firm Blackstone.",
      "China remains a major exporter of products to countries around the world and boasts a domestic market of 1.4 billion people. However, massive overbuilding in the property sector has tied up trillions of dollars in capital, sapping business and consumer confidence and depriving the economy of its past vitality, while a tariff war unleashed by the U.S. is compounding those problems.",

The policy of utilizing foreign investment has not changed and will not change,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cChina contains huge investment and consumption potential,\u201d he added.",
      "China has set an economic growth target of about 5% for this year, the same as last year and a level that analysts said would be difficult to achieve.",
      "The government has said it would attempt to stimulate the roughly $20 trillion economy by borrowing more money for a slew of initiatives, such as giving 300 billion yuan ($41.3 billion) in rebates to consumers who trade in old cars and appliances for new ones. But much of the borrowing will go to supporting the housing market and local governments weighed down by debt.",

      "NEW YORK -- Shares of major automakers slumped following President Donald Trump's announcement that he will place 25% tariffs on auto imports.",
      "Automakers have spread out their supply chains and production facilities throughout North America. Parts and production steps often cross one or more borders during the process. That means it will cost the major automakers more money to build their cars and trucks.",
      "The tariffs will take effect April 3.",
      "\u201cThere are still a lot of unknowns, but if this remains in place, there will clearly be some pain for the companies to digest,\u201d said Joseph Spak, analyst at UBS, in a note to investors.",
      "Higher costs will likely force companies to raise prices on new vehicles at a time when consumers are already faced with near record-high car prices. The tariffs could boost inflation overall, hurting consumers who are growing more worried about the economy.",
      "General Motors slumped 8.2%. The Detroit automaker could fare the worst among its peers under broad tariffs, as it sources about 40% of vehicles sold in the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, according to analysts at JPMorgan.",
      "Ford, which slipped 4.2%, is less exposed with under 10% of vehicles sourced outside of the U.S., JPMorgan said.",
      "Stellantis, which is based in the Netherlands but has significant manufacturing operations in North America, fell 2.5%.",
      "Honda shares traded in the U.S. fell 2.7% and Toyota shares traded in the U.S. fell 2.4%.",
      "The exception was Tesla. The cars it sells in the U.S. are produced domestically. Its shares rose more than 5%.",
      "Auto parts suppliers also lost ground. Autoliv fell 3.7%, Aptiv slipped 5.6% and Gentex fell 1.7%.",
      "Many automakers have been preparing for tariffs to impact their operations since Trump first announced plans to impose the taxes earlier this year. General Motors and others have worked to get more inventory into the U.S. ahead of any tariffs.",

      "Major anti-abortion groups are gathering in the nation's capital to begin a lobbying effort with Congress and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration aimed at eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- Major anti-abortion groups were gathering in the nation's capital on Thursday to begin a lobbying effort with Congress and President Donald Trump's administration aimed at eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood ahead of the Supreme Court hearing a case in April that could strip the organization's funding in South Carolina.",
      "The anti-abortion groups are taking aim at abortion providers under an initiative called Defund Planned Parenthood, which targets federal Medicaid funding for the reproductive health care provider.",
      "\u201cThis event begins an intensive round of outreach to the GOP, calling on them to take advantage of this unique moment to defund the abortion industry,\u201d Students for Life, the national anti-abortion group organizing the event, said in a statement.",
      "The Hyde Amendment already restricts government funding for most abortions, and less than 5% of the services Planned Parenthood provides are abortions, according to the organization\u2019s 2023 report. Planned Parenthood also provides other forms of reproductive health care, including contraception, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, often for low-income patients.",
      "Vicki Ringer, Planned Parenthood\u2019s South Carolina director of public affairs, said claims that Planned Parenthood uses Medicaid funding for abortion is \u201can attempt to mislead the public\u201d and emphasized Planned Parenthood\u2019s role in providing broader reproductive health care.",
      "\u201cWe should be expanding health care to low-income people rather than trying to kick off these people who rely on us for health care,\u201d Ringer said.",
      "Rachel Rebouche, dean of Temple University's Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia, said the Defund Planned Parenthood movement has been building for 10 years but has gained momentum as the anti-abortion movement has been emboldened by Trump\u2019s presidential victory and by his fellow Republicans winning control of Congress in November.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more enthusiasm in states like South Carolina and others to close down Planned Parenthood under the banner of stopping abortions, which their laws already do,\" she said.",
      "The Supreme Court announced it would hear a case involving South Carolina's attempt to strip Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. Experts say the lawsuit could prompt similar efforts in conservative states across the country to chip away at the organization's funding.",
      "Almost 100 conservative members of Congress signed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to side with South Carolina. The state already bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before many people know they're pregnant.",
      "In February, a panel of judges in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court ruling that attempted to force Planned Parenthood to repay millions of dollars of Medicaid funding in Texas and Louisiana.",
      "If the Supreme Court sides with South Carolina, Rebouche said, there may be a wider impact on health care by \"giving states broad power to exclude health care that is unpopular or politically disfavored,\u201d such as contraception. Targeting Planned Parenthood might also have a negative effect on maternal and infant mortality rates and could cost more money in the long run by cutting off low-income patients from vital preventive reproductive health care, she said.",
      "During a 2015 push to strip Planned Parenthood funding, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that doing so would cost the government $130 million over 10 years.",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers in at least three states \u2014 Missouri, Ohio and South Carolina \u2014 have introduced bills this year aiming to create tax breaks for anti-abortion centers.",
      "The strategies come during a time when abortion rights advocates are warning that Trump and his Cabinet hold significant power to restrict medication abortion access nationwide.",
      "Rather than immediately heeding calls from anti-abortion allies to restrict Medicaid funding for clinics that provide abortions, Trump has made quieter moves after waffling on the issue on the campaign trail.",
      "Trump reinstated a policy that requires foreign nongovernmental agencies to certify that they don\u2019t provide or promote abortion if they receive U.S. aid for family planning assistance. He also pardoned several anti-abortion activists convicted of blockading abortion clinics and used wording related to fetal personhood in an executive order rolling back protections for transgender people.",
      "The Republican president has appointed abortion opponents in some key Cabinet positions that could affect the availability of medication abortion and contraception, Medicaid coverage for family planning services, collection of abortion-related data and abortion access for troops and veterans.",
      "Advocates on either side of the abortion debate are waiting to see if Trump's Department of Justice will revive the Comstock Act, a 19th-century obscenity law, to restrict the mailing of medication abortion or other materials used for abortions. Attorney General Pam Bondi has a history of defending abortion restrictions, and her confirmation was celebrated by abortion opponents.",

      "PARIS -- The monthslong trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the alleged illegal financing of his 2007 presidential campaign is shedding light on France's back-channel talks with the government of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "Family members of terrorist attacks sponsored by Gadhafi's regime have told the court they suspect that Sarkozy was willing to sacrifice the memories of their loved ones in order to normalize ties with Libya almost two decades ago.",
      "French prosecutors on Thursday requested a seven-year prison sentence for the 70-year-old former leader. Sarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The trial, which started in January, is to continue until April 8, with Sarkozy's lawyers to plead on the last day. The verdict is expected at a later date.",
      "Some key moments in the trial have focused on talks between France and Libya in the 2000s, when Gadhafi was seeking to restore diplomatic ties with the West. Before that, Libya was considered a pariah state for having sponsored attacks.",
      "French families of victims of a 1989 plane bombing told the court about their shock and sense of betrayal as the trial questioned whether promises possibly made to Gadhafi\u2019s government were part of the alleged corruption deal.",
      "In 1988, a bomb planted aboard a Pam Am flight exploded while the plane was over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people from 21 countries, including 190 Americans.",
      "The following year, on Sept. 19, 1989, the bombing of UTA flight 772 over Niger killed 170 people, including 54 French nationals on board, after an in-flight explosion caused by a suitcase bomb.",
      "Both French and U.S. investigations have tied both bombings to Libya, whose government had engaged in long-running hostilities with the U.S. and other Western governments.",
      "Now, families of victims are wondering whether French government officials close to Sarkozy promised to forget about the bombings in exchange for business opportunities with the oil-rich nation and possibly, an alleged corruption deal.",
      "\u201cWhat did they do with our dead?\u201d Nicoletta Diasio, the daughter of a man who died in the bombing, has told the court, saying she wondered if the memories of the victims \u201ccould have been used for bartering\u201d in talks between France and Libya.",
      "During the trial, Sarkozy has said he has \u201cnever ever betrayed\u201d families of victims. \u201cI have never traded their fate for any compromise, nor pact of realpolitik,\u201d he said.",
      "Libya was long a pariah state for its involvement in the 1980s bombings.",
      "In 2003, it took responsibility for both the 1988 and 1989 plane bombings and agreed to pay billions in compensation to the victims\u2019 families.",
      "Gadhafi also announced he was dismantling his nuclear weapons program, which led to the lifting of international sanctions against the country.",
      "Britain, France and other Western countries sought to restore a relationship with Libya for security, diplomatic and business purposes.",
      "In 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to Paris with honors for a five-day official visit, allowing him to set up a bedouin tent near the Elysee presidential palace. Many French people still remember that gesture, feeling Sarkozy went too far to please a dictator.",
      "Sarkozy said during the trial he would have preferred to \u201cdo without\u201d Gadhafi\u2019s visit at the time but it came as a diplomatic gesture after Libya\u2019s release of Bulgarian nurses who were imprisoned and facing death sentences for a crime they said they did not commit.",
      "On July 24, 2007, under an accord partially brokered by first lady Cecilia Sarkozy and EU officials, Libya released the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor.",
      "The medics, who had spent over eight years in prison, faced death sentence on charges they deliberately infected hundreds of children with the AIDS virus in the late 1990s \u2014 an allegation they denied.",
      "The release of the medics removed the last major obstacle to Libya\u2019s rejoining the international community.",
      "Sarkozy travelled to the capital, Tripoli, for talks with Gadhafi the day after the medics were returned to Bulgaria on a French presidential plane.",
      "In court has spoken of his \u201cpride to have saved those six persons.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you did not discuss with Gadhafi, you\u2019d not get the release of the nurses,\u201d he said.",
      "Accused of masterminding the attack on UTA Flight 772, Gadhafi\u2019s brother-in-law and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senoussi was convicted in absentia to a life sentence by a Paris court in 1999 for the attack.",
      "An international arrest warrant was issued for him and five other suspects.",
      "Financial prosecutors have accused Sarkozy of having promised to lift the arrest warrant targeting al-Senoussi in exchange for alleged campaign financing.",
      "In 2005, people close to Sarkozy, who was at the time the interior minister, including his chief of staff Claude Gu\u00e9ant and junior minister Brice Hortefeux, travelled to Tripoli, where they met with al-Senoussi.",

      "Al-Senoussi told investigative judges that millions of dollars were provided to support Sarkozy\u2019s campaign. Accused of war crimes, he is now imprisoned in Libya.",
      "Sarkozy has strongly denied that.",
      "Gadhafi's son, Seif al-Islam, told the French news network RFI in January that he was personally involved in giving Sarkozy 5 million dollars in cash.",
      "Seif al-Islam sent RFI radio a two-page statement on his version of events. It was the first time he talked to the media about the case since 2011.",
      "He said Sarkozy initially \u201creceived $2.5 million from Libya to finance his electoral campaign\u201d during the 2007 presidential election, in return for which Sarkozy would \u201cconclude agreements and carry out projects in favour of Libya.\u201d",
      "He said a second payment of $2.5 million in cash was handed over without specifying when it was given.",
      "According to him, Libyan authorities expected that in return, Sarkozy would end a legal case about the 1989 UTA Flight 771 attack \u2014 including removing his name from an international warrant notice.",
      "Sarkozy strongly denied those allegations.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll never find one Libyan euro, one Libyan cent in my campaign,\" he said at the opening of the trial in January. \u201cThere\u2019s no corruption money because there was no corruption.\"",
      "The Libyan civil war started in February 2011, with army units and militiamen loyal to Gadhafi opposing rebels.",
      "Sarkozy was the first Western leader to take a public stance to support the rebellion.",
      "On Feb. 25, 2011, he said the violence by pro-Gadhafi forces was unacceptable and should not go unpunished. \u201cGadhafi must go,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "On March 10 that year, France was the first country in the world to recognize the National Transitional Council as the legitimate government of Libya.",
      "\u201cThat was the Arab Spring,\u201d Sarkozy told the court. \u201cGadhafi was the only dictator who had sent (military) aircrafts against his people. He had promised rivers of blood, that\u2019s his expression.\u201d",

The U.S. is the biggest destination for Japanese car exports.",
      "\u201cI am very concerned about the behavior of the American government,\u201d Lula said. \u201cI am concerned because free trade is being harmed and I am concerned because multilateralism is weakened,\u201d Lula said through an interpreter.",

      "LONDON -- A badly damaged cargo ship which collided with a U.S. tanker in the North Sea earlier this month arrived in the Scottish port of Aberdeen Friday, following a fire that lasted for nearly a week.",
      "Following a tug-assisted journey that lasted a few days, the Portugal-flagged Solong docked in Aberdeen for \u201csafe berthing\u201d and damage assessment.",
      "The damage to the ship following its collision on March 10 with an anchored tanker, the MV Stena Immaculate, and the ensuing fire, was clearly visible from the shore. The tanker was transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military in the North Sea.",
      "\u201cSalvage of the Solong has progressed to enable its relocation to the Port of Aberdeen for safe berthing,\" said chief coastguard Paddy O\u2019Callaghan. \u201cThe Stena Immaculate remains in a stable condition with salvage ongoing.\u201d",

      "The Solong's Russian captain, Vladimir Motin, has been remanded in custody over the death of a crew member, 38-year-old Filipino national Mark Angelo Pernia., who is missing and presumed dead. Motin, 59, has been charged with \u201cgross negligence manslaughter\u201d and is due to appear at the Central Criminal Court in London, better known as the Old Bailey, on April 14.",

      "According to conservationists, the nurdles are not toxic but can harm animals if ingested.",
      "Local authorities are working to remove the nurdles.",

      "David Childs, the lead architect of the One World Trade Center skyscraper that rose from the site where the Twin Towers collapsed in New York City during the 9/11 attacks, has died. He was 83.",
      "Childs died on Wednesday in Pelham, New York, from Lewy body dementia, which had been diagnosed in September, his son, Nicholas Childs said.",
      "While he was perhaps best known for his work on One World Trade Center, considered to be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, Childs also was instrumental in other important projects, including a new master plan for the National Mall in Washington, D.C., an expansion of Dulles International Airport in Virginia and the 7 World Trade Center building in Manhattan, according to his firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.",
      "\u201cDavid\u2019s contribution to the firm was extensive and profound, and we will always be grateful to David for his leadership, his impact, and his friendship,\u201d Skidmore, Owings & Merrill said in a statement. \u201cWe will miss him dearly and extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to his family.\u201d",
      "A fond memory that Nicholas Childs has was when his father drew a rendering of what the One World Trade Center property would look like while they were out having lunch in New York, some years after 9/11 but well before the plans were finalized.",
      "\u201cHe picked up a paper napkin, took out a pen, and drew what became the ultimate design of the building on the napkin for me,\u201d Nicholas Childs said in a phone interview Friday, adding that he still has the drawing.",
      "He said his father was a civic-minded architect who would often use a quote by 20th century American-German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe \u2014 \u201cGod is in the details.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe cared deeply about those details and making something beautiful,\u201d Nicholas Childs said. \u201cBut he also wanted to make sure, I think as any great architect, that it was a balance of form and function, that it worked for people.\u201d",
      "The 1,776-foot-tall (540-meter-tall) One World Trade Center, once known as the Freedom Tower, is the centerpiece of the redevelopment of ground zero, along with the memorial pools placed where the Twin Towers stood. Opened in 2014, it sports a steel and glass structure that rises into the sky with a tapered, eight-triangle body, topped by a 408-foot-tall (124-meter-tall) needle.",
      "The final design was produced after contentious negotiations between Childs and Daniel Libeskind, who designed the overall plan for the site, and arguments between government officials over what should be built at ground zero and objections by some relatives of 9/11 victims to the design of the Trade Center memorial.",
      "Libeskind had drawn the first plans for building, a twisting glass skyscraper with an off-center spire meant to invoke the Statue of Liberty.",
      "Childs produced a sleeker version of Libeskind\u2019s design, then reworked it after police expressed concerns that the building was not sturdy enough to withstand a truck bomb.",
      "In announcing the new design plans, Childs said the One World Trade Center tower is \u201ciconic, simple and pure in its form, a memorable form that will reclaim the resilience and the spirit of our democracy.\u201d",
      "He also called it \u201cthe safest building in the world,\u201d with features including wider staircases, a separate stairway and elevator for firefighters, \u201cblast-resistant glazing\u201d and more public stairways with direct access to the street.",
      "Childs was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1941 and grew up in his early childhood years in Washington, D.C., before moving to Mount Kisco, New York. He attended the private Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, before going to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in architecture.",
      "He was hired by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1971 for its Washington, D.C., office, where he worked on projects including a new master plan for the National Mall, the Constitution Gardens park along the mall and the Four Seasons Hotel.",
      "He transferred to the firm's New York City office in 1984 and had a hand in significant projects in the city, including 1 Worldwide Plaza in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan and the Deutsche Bank Center, formerly called the Time Warner Center, with its twin skyscraper towers at Columbus Circle.",
      "Childs also worked on the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, Canada, the Canary Wharf development in London and King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",
      "In 2004, he was honored with a Rome Prize for architecture, awarded by the American Academy in Rome for innovative work in the arts and humanities.",
      "Childs is survived by his wife, Annie; three children, Nicholas, Joshua and Jocelyn; and several grandchildren.",
      "The family is planning a small, private memorial in the coming weeks, followed by a larger service around May, Nicholas Childs said.",

      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Charlie Javice, the charismatic founder of a startup company that claimed to be revolutionizing the way college students apply for financial aid, was convicted on Friday of defrauding one of the largest U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase, out of $175 million by exaggerating her customer base by 10 times.",
      "A jury in New York City returned its verdict after a five-week trial. Javice, 32, faces the possibility of a lengthy prison term.",
      "Javice was in her mid-20s when she founded Frank, a company with software that promised to simplify the process of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, a complex government form used by students to apply for aid for college or graduate school.",
      "The company promoted itself as a way for financially needy students to obtain more aid faster, in return for a few hundred dollars in fees. Javice appeared regularly on cable news programs to boost Frank\u2019s profile, once appearing on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list before JPMorgan bought the startup in 2021.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the leaders of nearly 30 countries plus NATO and European Union chiefs. The summit comes at a crucial juncture in the more than three-year war, with intensifying diplomatic efforts to broker ceasefires, driven by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to end the fighting.",
      "But the conflict is raging on.",
      "Before the leaders met in the luxury of the French presidential palace, Russian drone attacks overnight wounded more than 20 people and heavy shelling Thursday afternoon killed one person and knocked out electricity in parts of Kherson, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "U.S.-brokered agreements this week to safeguard shipping in the Black Sea and last week to halt long-range strikes on energy infrastructure were greeted as a first step toward peace. But Ukraine and Russia have disagreed over the details and accused each other of deal violations, foreshadowing a long and contentious process ahead.",
      "France and the United Kingdom are pushing a separate initiative to build a coalition of nations willing in one way or another to support the deployment of a European armed force in Ukraine, with the aim of securing any peace deal by dissuading Russia from attacking the country again.",
      "Some European countries are more comfortable with a potential deployment than others \u2014 not least because a big unknown is whether Trump would allow American forces and intelligence agencies to back up any European contingent with air and logistical support and other assistance.",
      "Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent \u2014 U.K. officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops \u2014 would also be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming. There would also be questions to resolve about who would command the force and how it might respond to a major violation by Russia of any peace agreement.",
      "The office of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who's driving the European initiative together with Macron, said that military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details of how such a force might be put together, examining \u201cthe full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.\u201d",
      "In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on European nations to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, dating back to his first presidency, the proposed contingent is also seen as a test of Europe\u2019s ability to defend itself and its interests.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted an image from inside the summit of him and other leaders standing together with the caption: \u201cEurope knows how to defend itself. We must prove it.\u201d",

      "Macron didn\u2019t specify what sort of response he envisaged. But he suggested that a Russian attack might not go unanswered, even though the European troops wouldn't be deployed to the front lines.",
      "\u201cIf there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it\u2019s our usual framework of engagement,\u201d Macron said. \u201cOur soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.",
      "\u201cSo we are not on the front lines, we don\u2019t go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It\u2019s a pacifist approach,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.\u201d",
      "The meeting in Paris came as Russia has demanded lifting sanctions to meet its terms for the Black Sea ceasefire.",
      "Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and Europe have punished Russia\u2019s economy and limited its access to global markets.",
      "Zelenskyy accused Moscow of attempting to add conditions to what should be an unconditional agreement.",
      "While the White House said that it would help restore Russia\u2019s access to the world market for fertilizer and farm exports, it didn\u2019t validate Moscow\u2019s conditions. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Russia\u2019s demands would be evaluated and presented to Trump.",
      "There has been a growing chorus of opposition in Europe to lifting the sanctions, which remain their main leverage against Moscow.",
      "Ant\u00f3nio Costa, the president of the European Council representing the EU's 27 member states, said that sanctions are crucial to support Ukraine and reach a lasting peace.",
      "\u201cThis means keeping up the pressure on Russia through sanctions,\u201d Costa said Thursday.",
      "As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine's allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv's hand militarily. Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression.",
      "Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support.",
      "Russian drone attacks overnight wounded at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a front-line community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.",
      "Zelenskyy said that the attacks were further evidence that the U.S. and Europe shouldn't ease sanctions on Moscow.",

      "Kroger also claimed that Albertsons was secretly planning to sue Kroger if the deal didn\u2019t go through long before the merger actually fell apart in December. Kroger said in Tuesday's court filing that it should not be forced to pay Albertsons a $600 million termination fee as well as billions of dollars in legal fees.",

      "\u201cKroger\u2019s self-interested conduct doomed the merger, and we are now focused on returning value to Albertsons\u2019 shareholders to compensate for those losses,\u201d Albertsons said.",
      "Kroger and Albertsons first proposed the merger in 2022. They argued that combining would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart and Costco.",
      "But the Federal Trade Commission and two states \u2014 Washington and Colorado \u2014 sued to block the merger last year, saying it would raise prices and lower workers\u2019 wages by eliminating competition. It also said Kroger and Albertsons' plan to divest 579 stores C&S Wholesalers was inadequate to ensure competition, since C&S was ill-equipped to take on so many stores.",
      "In December, judges in Washington and Oregon halted the merger in two rulings issued within hours of each other.",
      "Kroger said even after lower courts ruled, it believed the merger still had a chance of going through. Kroger said it told Albertsons it was planning to re-engage with the FTC after President Donald Trump's election because it thought the FTC under Trump would be less hostile to mergers.",
      "But instead, Albertsons filed a lawsuit against Kroger the day after the lower court rulings. Albertsons said Kroger refused to divest more stores, even as it became clear that regulators weren't satisfied with its plans. Albertsons said Kroger also should have sought other buyers beyond C&S to satisfy regulators' concerns.",

      "Biosolids, or sewage sludge, are the solid byproducts of the wastewater treatment process. Rich in nutrients, they can be used as fertilizer on agricultural fields or compost on lawns.",
      "But the process for producing these materials can vary greatly, and some unwanted things can end up in those biosolids. A recent study released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggested that human health risks associated with toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were elevated in some places where sludge was applied to farm fields.",
      "The amount of these \u201cforever chemicals\u201d that could end up in biosolids depends on how much were in the water coming into the plant.",
      "\u201cThey are very widespread,\u201d said Carsten Prasse, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies biosolids. But they're not in all biosolids and sometimes it's only in small amounts, he added.",
      "Here's how they're made:",
      "At most treatment plants, wastewater is pumped in through large pipes and large debris removal begins immediately. At a facility just outside Columbus, Ohio, a machine screens out large debris such as toilet paper and trash. That debris is collected, compacted and taken to a landfill for disposal.",
      "After large debris is removed, the wastewater flows into a sedimentation tank, a large, open-air and cone-shaped tank where gravity pulls heavier solids to the bottom. A long mechanical arm corrals floating solids into a drain on the top of the tank. A similar arm at the bottom of the tank gathers up the solids there.",
      "The liquid is moved from the sedimentation tanks to an aeration tank where air encourages the growth of microbes that further break down organic particles. The wastewater then gets moved back to another sedimentation tank where more solids are removed.",
      "The solids that are removed at each step of the process are put through thickening centrifuges, then go into these tanks for anaerobic digestion, where microbes continue breaking down organic matter. The tanks are heated to a prescribed temperature for a certain number of days to kill off most pathogens.",
      "After another thickening step, the solids are ready to apply to farm fields based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regulations for land-applied biosolids.",
      "\u201cThere are values in using biosolids in agriculture because of their high nutrient concentrations,\u201d including nitrogen and phosphorus, Prasse said. They can also help strengthen soil and help with irrigation, he added.",
      "Some treatment facilities further dry out sludge, turning it into a dirt-like material that can emit steam as microbes do their work in decomposition.",
      "The waste that make up biosolids can vary widely depending on what\u2019s in the water. In addition to human waste, biosolids might contain all kinds of everyday household chemicals like beauty products and pharmaceuticals, some of which may contain forever chemicals, Prasse added. At the Columbus facility, the majority of their waste comes from households and businesses.",
      "The Columbus facility tests the final product for metals and nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen every month even when they are being stored before land application.",
      "In Columbus, the city takes half of these dirt-like biosolids to a composting facility nearby, where they are mixed with other organic material like trees and leaves and turned into compost after an additional round of heating and aeration to further kill off pathogens. These biosolids are less regulated and can be used on land such as parks or a residential yard.",
      "The Columbus facility, like most such operations, doesn't test the incoming material for PFAS, an expensive proposition. Dixon said any future testing or treatment of wastewater for PFAS at his facility would depend on future federal regulations.",

      "Someone should have spotted the alarming number of near misses in the skies over the nation's capital before the fatal midair collision that killed 67 people in January, and reviewing the data now could prevent future crashes, according to the head of the agency investigating the crash.",
      "National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy emphasized to Congress Wednesday that the Federal Aviation Administration had data going back to 2011 showing that collision alarms were sounding inside cockpits at least once a month because of how close the planes were getting to helicopters. But the FAA didn't act, she said.",
      "\u201cAll this data is being collected by FAA from operators, from others, from voluntary reporting systems. Where is that data going to trend potential accidents and incidents in the future?\u201d Homendy said during a hearing on her agency's budget. \u201cThe next accident is in the data right now. And what are we doing to figure out what that is?\u201d",
      "The Senate is planning another hearing Thursday to delve deeper into what the NTSB has found so far about the Jan. 29 midair collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., Ronald Reagan National Airport. Homendy and the leaders of the FAA and Army's aviation division will all testify.",
      "Both Homendy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month when NTSB first disclosed the shocking statistics that they were angry that the FAA didn't recognize the dangers before this crash after 85 near misses in the past three years when aircraft flew within a few hundred feet (meters) of each other.",
      "The FAA promptly launched a review of all its data after the NTSB briefing to try to identify any similar safety threats, particularly in eight cities with heavy helicopter traffic. The FAA said Wednesday that analysis continues.",
      "That review \u2014 aided by artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 is focused on airports in Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles and the heavy helicopter traffic off the Gulf Coast. The FAA hasn't said whether it has found anything yet, but the agency promised it \u201cwill have corrective action plans for any risks that are identified.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, the FAA quickly adopted the NTSB's recommendation to permanently close off a particular helicopter route near Reagan anytime planes are taking off or landing on the airport's runway 33 that the jetliner was approaching in January when the collision happened. If a helicopter does need to use that route for an urgent reason, no planes will be allowed to take off or land. That should ensure that planes and helicopters are no longer sharing the same airspace near the airport, officials said.",
      "\u201cThe FAA will continue to closely support the NTSB-led investigation and take action as necessary to ensure public safety,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Homendy declined Wednesday to address President Donald Trump's comments right after the crash suggesting that diversity and inclusion policies at the FAA may have contributed to it because the NTSB investigation isn't complete. A final report identifying the cause isn't expected for more than year.

      "New Jersey Democrat Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman said it is important to refute those diversity comments now because nothing has been found so far to support them, and she doesn't want the public to get the idea that diversity is the problem.",
      "\u201cOn the contrary, loyalty and sycophants seems to be the order of the day, and it\u2019s definitely negatively impacting this federal government doing its job,\u201d Watson Coleman said during the hearing.",
      "Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls at airports.",
      "The NTSB previously said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers. The helicopter was at 278 feet (85 meters) at the time of the collision, which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for that location.",
      "The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.",

      "Delaware lawmakers are putting aside protests from big investors and approving fast-tracked legislation that backers say will protect its status as the world's corporate capital",
      "Delaware lawmakers put aside protests from major investors and approved fast-tracked legislation Tuesday night that backers say will protect its status as the corporate capital of the world after criticism by billionaire Elon Musk and other influential business titans rattled public officials.",
      "The bill is headed to Gov. Matt Meyer, a Democrat who met with corporate leaders about their concerns about precedent-setting court decisions governing corporate conflicts of interest and urged lawmakers to quickly pass changes to the law.",
      "They did, sending the bill through both chambers within two weeks of its introduction, despite shareholders\u2019 lawyers, consumer groups and pension funds slamming it as a giveaway to billionaires and corporate insiders. The House approved it Tuesday night, 32-7, after a unanimous Senate earlier in March.",
      "Delaware\u2019s experienced corporate law courts and their well-developed body of corporate case law have become the go-to destination to settle all sorts of business disputes as the legal home of more than 2 million corporate entities, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies.",
      "The state also reaps billions of dollars from the activity, making lawmakers nervous that corporations could flee Delaware and undercut a major source of revenue that funds one-third of Delaware's operating budget.",
      "After two hours of debate Tuesday, Rep. Krista Griffith told colleagues that the bill was complex, but the reasons for voting for it were simple: \u201cProtect Delaware\u2019s economy, protect future opportunities for the people in our state. We have the best business court in the nation.\u201d",
      "However, an opponent, Rep. Madinah Wilson-Anton \u2014 referring to the business courts as Delaware's \u201cgolden goose\u201d \u2014 warned that the changes being passed could end up \"cooking that golden goose.\u201d",
      "A legal challenge is widely expected after Meyer signs the bill.",
      "In hearings, lawmakers were warned by corporate lawyers and state officials that businesses were contemplating moving their legal home \u2014 a \u201cDexit,\u201d as it has been dubbed \u2014 and that startups are being advised to incorporate elsewhere, such as competitors Nevada or Texas.",
      "Corporate leaders complained about a lack of predictability, clarity and fairness, lawmakers were told.",
      "Last year, Musk slammed Delaware, saying \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware\u201d and instead recommended Nevada or Texas as destinations after a Delaware judge invalidated his landmark compensation package from Tesla worth potentially more than $55 billion.",
      "Musk and Tesla are appealing in the state Supreme Court, and Musk\u2019s companies \u2014 Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink \u2014 all departed Delaware for Nevada or Texas.",
      "The fallout seemed to accelerate in recent weeks when the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platforms \u2014 the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 was considering moving its incorporation to Texas. Meta \u2014 run by billionaire chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 didn\u2019t confirm the report.",
      "The bill has come under withering criticism that it will tilt the playing field decisively against investors, including pensioners and middle-class savers, and make it harder for them to hold billionaires and corporate insiders accountable for violating their fiduciary duty.",
      "In a statement, the Consumer Federation of America said Delaware's lawmakers \u201cclearly failed to protect investors with the passage of the Billionaire\u2019s Bill.\u201d",
      "Opponents argue that the bill overturns decades of court precedents. But its backers say it is only affecting newer precedents, modernizing the law, clarifying gray areas and maintaining balance between corporate officers and shareholders.",
      "The bill changes several provisions.",
      "One, it gives corporate officers and controlling stockholders more protections in certain conflict-of-interest cases in state courts when fighting shareholder lawsuits.",
      "Two, it limits the kind of documents that a company must produce in court cases and makes it harder for stockholders to get access to internal documents or communication that could prove time-consuming and expensive for a company to produce \u2014 not to mention, damaging to its case.",
      "Institutional investors warn that such a law may prompt them to push corporations that they own to incorporate elsewhere.",

      "Josh Giddey thought the ball was going in as soon as his buzzer-beating halfcourt heave left his fingertips",
      "CHICAGO -- CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Josh Giddey could feel it as soon as the ball left his fingertips. In a flash, teammates were mobbing him.",
      "Giddey's buzzer-beating halfcourt heave capped what might be the wildest finish in the NBA this season and gave the surging Chicago Bulls a 119-117 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night.",
      "\u201cSpecial moment to do it with these guys, this team,\u201d Giddey said.",
      "The Lakers, meanwhile, went from winning at Indiana on a tip-in by LeBron James at the buzzer on Wednesday to losing in gut-wrenching fashion. They also took it on the chin again from Chicago after getting blown out in Los Angeles on Saturday.",
      "\u201cDevastation,\u201d Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a way to lose a basketball game.\u201d",
      "The Lakers led by 13 midway through the fourth quarter and appeared to be in good shape up 115-110 after Austin Reaves made two free throws with 12.6 seconds remaining, only to lose for the eighth time in 12 games. They have a day to shake it off before closing out a four-game trip at Memphis.",
      "\u201cWe put ourselves in position to win, gave up a lot of 3s in the fourth quarter, still put ourselves in position to win,\u201d James said. \u201cHorrible turnover by myself, miscommunication the play before that. AR tried to save us. Tip your hats.\"",
      "The Bulls made 11 of 14 3-pointers in the fourth. They nailed three in the final 10 seconds, starting with one by Patrick Williams.",
      "Giddey then stole a pass from James and fed Coby White for a 3 to put the Bulls on top with 6.1 seconds remaining.",
      "Reaves drove for a layup to give the Lakers a 117-116 lead with 3.3 seconds left, Chicago had just enough time to pull out the win.",
      "Giddey inbounded to Patrick Williams, got the ball back and pulled up near the Bulls logo. He held his follow-through right until the shot fell through the net, giving the Bulls their ninth win in 11 games and setting off one wild celebration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve shown over the last month to six weeks that we can beat anybody,\u201d Giddey said. \u201cThe way we play the game, I think it wears people down. We get up and down. We run. We put heat on them to get back. A lot of veteran teams don\u2019t particularly want to get back and play in transition.\u201d",
      "The Bulls looked like a lifeless team a month ago. They traded Zach LaVine to Sacramento prior to the deadline and seemed to be packing it in after six straight losses left them with a 22-35 record. They're 11-5 since then, and they haven't just been picking on weak teams. They've beaten the Lakers twice and Denver in the past three games and also have a win over Indiana during this stretch.",
      "Giddey and White have been at their best lately.",
      "Giddey delivered his fifth triple-double on Thursday with 25 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists. The only Bulls player with more in a season was Michael Jordan with 15 in 1988-89.",
      "White finished with 26 points after scoring 35 or more in a career-high three straight games, and the Bulls simply didn't quit. Coach Billy Donovan said that took hold in September, during the players' workouts at the team's facility prior to the start of training camp.",
      "\u201cWe've got to be in great shape to play this way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey've got to push themselves. I think a lot of that stemmed before training camp started, when they all came back in September. They played most of their pickup games with a 14-second shot clock just to kind of get that mentality down. We tried to go through training camp like that. I think there's advantages by really trying to play in a way that forces these guys to be in great shape.\u201d ___",

      "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Dawn Staley sent JuJu Watkins a text as soon as she saw the star Southern California sophomore suffer a season-ending knee injury on Monday night.",
      "It was \u201creally tough\u201d to see Watkins in pain, the South Carolina women's basketball coach said.",
      "\u201cJuJu is loved by all of us,\" Staley added.",
      "Coaches and players all across women's basketball, along with fans of the game, feel the impact of Watkins' injury. The dominant USC guard and Associated Press All-America first-teamer will likely miss significant time, leaving the sport without one of its most transcendent stars during March Madness.",
      "How Watkins\u2019 absence will affect the women\u2019s Sweet 16 remains to be seen, though attendance and ratings are down from last season\u2019s record highs for the women\u2019s tournament that featured Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. But that shouldn\u2019t come as surprise.",
      "After the record-setting numbers that tuned in for the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird showdown in the 1979 national championship, the ratings for the 1980 tourney signficantly dropped.",
      "\u201cJuJu is raising our game up with how she plays,\" said Staley, whose Gamecocks will face Maryland on Friday in the Sweet 16, \"with pouring into marketing when it comes to NIL deals. She\u2019s a business herself. And to see part of that not be a part of our NCAA Tournament \u2014 something is missing. There\u2019s a big void.\u201d",
      "In the opening two rounds of this year's women's tournament, there were 224,972 fans in attendance, representing a 30% decrease from last season\u2019s record that saw 292,456 people show up. Still, this year\u2019s mark is the third highest ever, also trailing the 231,677 that came to March Madness in 2023.",
      "Ratings also dropped, with the first round averaging 367,000 viewers across all 32 games. That\u2019s a 22% drop from last season. But those numbers are up 43% from the 2023 tournament, which was the second-most watched ever.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a massive disappointment because she\u2019s such an extraordinary player,\u201d said ESPN college basketball analyst Rebecca Lobo. \u201cPeople would be watching her for the first time in the regionals. It\u2019s a huge disappointment and blow as we\u2019ve had so much growth over last year and a half.",
      "\"She\u2019s been a big part of that.\u201d",
      "Watkins' knee bent awkwardly as she planted her right foot on a fast break five minutes into USC's victory against Mississippi State in the second round. She immediately grimaced and collapsed onto the court before being carried off by multiple people, unable to put any weight on her leg. USC later said she would have surgery and then rehabilitate.",
      "After the injury, many took to social media to express their heartbreak and send encouragement, including Johnson, Reese and Clark.",
      "\u201cSending all my thoughts and prayers to JuJu,\u201d Clark posted on X. \u201cKid will come back stronger than ever.\u201d",
      "Watkins had emerged as the next face of women's college basketball after Clark raised its profile to unprecedented levels while at Iowa. The 6-foot-2 Watkins led USC to its deepest run in the NCAA Tournament in over 25 years last season and was the nation\u2019s No. 2 scorer, averaging 27.1 points.",
      "She has NIL deals with Nike, Fanatics, snack maker Mondelez, United Airlines, Degree deodorant, State Farm, Gatorade and collectibles company Funko, among others. And her NIL valuation is one of the highest in the country at an estimated $739,000, according to On3.com.",
      "Celebrities all over star-studded Los Angeles flocked to USC's Galen Center to watch her play this season, including movie star Michael B. Jordan, rapper Snoop Dogg and Vanessa Bryant.",
      "While this year's field is full of individual talent and numerous legitimate title contenders, many were excited to watch Watkins continue her stellar season \u2014 in which she averaged 24.6 points \u2014 and potentially lead the Trojans to their first national championship in 41 years.",
      "\u201cMy mom played basketball at Santa Clara, so I\u2019ve kind of been tapped into the tournament,\" said Claire Swendsen, 22, who is in Spokane, Washington, for the other half of the Sweet 16. \"I have planned on attending one of UConn\u2019s and one of USC\u2019s games. This kind of puts a damper on the SC game.\"",
      "There are still big names in the tournament that resonate with fans, including Connecticut senior Paige Bueckers, who also had to rebound from an ACL injury and is making her last run at a national championship. UConn\u2019s blowout win over South Dakota State was the most-watched game of the second round, drawing an average of 1.7 million viewers to ESPN on Monday night.",
      "Watkins \"will come back better and stronger,\u201d said UCLA coach Cori Close. \" ... She\u2019s such a fighter. She\u2019ll be ready. That being said, I feel like it\u2019s time for people around the country to really step up and see some of the other amazing players who are ready to shine. I am so sad that JuJu is not playing in the tournament anymore, but I am excited for other players are going to step into that spotlight.\u201d",
      "There are many talented players in the women's field, but few with Watkins' star power.",

      "\u201cEven if both USC and UConn are there,\u201d Lobo added, \"it won\u2019t be the same without JuJu. They are the biggest stars in women\u2019s basketball. Missing one of them is huge.\u201d",

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Brazilian soccer player Dani Alves won his appeal against a sexual assault conviction as a Spanish court overturned the ruling Friday in a case that lasted more than three years and saw the former Barcelona defender spend 14 months in jail.",
      "Alves was found guilty in February 2024 of raping a woman in a nightclub in December 2022 and sentenced to four years, six months in prison. Alves denied wrongdoing during the three-day trial.",
      "That court ruled Friday that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to rule out Alves' presumption of innocence.",
      "\u201cDani Alves is innocent, and that has been proven,\u201d his defense lawyer In\u00e9s Guardiola told Catalan radio RAC1. \u201cJustice has finally been served.\u201d",
      "The plaintiff's lawyer did not immediately respond to The Associated Press when emailed and messaged asking for comment.",
      "The Alves trial was the first high-profile case since Spain overhauled its laws in 2022 to make consent central to defining a sex crime in response to an upswell of protests after a gang-rape case during the San Fermin bull-running festival in Pamplona in 2016.",
      "The legislation popularly known as the \u201conly yes means yes\u201d law defines consent as an explicit expression of a person\u2019s will, making it clear that silence or passivity do not equal consent.",
      "But the four judges of a Barcelona-based appeals court ruled unanimously to overturn the conviction after reviewing the evidence and testimonies given to the lower court. In their ruling, they wrote that the testimony of the plaintiff \u201cdiffered notably\u201d from evidence of video footage taken before the woman and Alves entered the bathroom where she said he forced her to have sex without her consent.",
      "Before last year's trial, the alleged victim told state prosecutors that she had danced with Alves at the nightclub and willingly entered the bathroom, but that later when she wanted to leave he would not let her. She said he slapped her, insulted her and forced her to have sex against her will.",
      "Alves denied those accusations at the three-day trial.",
      "\u201cShe never told me to stop. We were both enjoying ourselves,\u201d Alves said, while repeating that the woman never asked to leave or made any indication that she did not want to have sex with him. He also denied having slapped or insulted her.",
      "Alves, now 41, was kept in jail from Jan. 20, 2023 until March 2024 until he was released after paying 1 million euros (then $1.2 million) for bail while awaiting his appeal. He also handed over his passports, with prosecutors having argued against releasing him on bail because of a possible flight risk.",
      "Prosecutors wanted his prison sentence increased to nine years while the victim\u2019s lawyer wanted him to stay behind bars for 12 years.",
      "This decision could be appealed to the Spanish supreme court in Madrid.",
      "Alves was one of the most successful players of his generation and won dozens of titles with elite clubs including Barcelona, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain. He also helped Brazil win two Copa Americas and an Olympic gold medal at age 38. He played at his third World Cup, the only major title he hasn\u2019t won, in 2022. He played for Barcelona from 2008-16, helping the team win three Champions Leagues and six Spanish leagues, and briefly rejoined the club in 2022. He still has a residence near the city.",

    "story": [
      "Attorneys for Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva are taking her doping case back to court",
      "Attorneys for Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva are taking her doping case back to court, arguing the World Anti-Doping Agency withheld and altered evidence that could have proven her contamination claim during the hearing that resulted in her four-year suspension.",
      "The experiment conducted by scientist Martial Saugy at the request of Russia\u2019s anti-doping agency through its channels at WADA was kept secret until The Associated Press revealed details of it last September, along with WADA\u2019s concerns about it.",
      "\u201cWe have a big issue,\u201d WADA\u2019s director general wrote to its general counsel after learning of the experiment. \u201cHow come we have Saugy doing an opinion for Valieva, super-favorable to her?\u201d",
      "Details of Saugy\u2019s experiment about how Valieva could have been contaminated by drinking a strawberry smoothie her grandfather made never showed up during a five-day-long hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2023 at which WADA and others had been asked to produce all material related to the skater's positive test.",
      "After reading the AP story about the experiment, Valieva\u2019s attorneys filed an appeal with the Swiss Supreme Court \u2014 considered the last, and usually futile, attempt to appeal CAS decisions \u2014 asking for details of the experiment to be released.",
      "WADA eventually provided it, and the AP obtained a copy of Saugy\u2019s 11-page memo. It details the painstaking lengths he took to see if Valieva\u2019s contamination claim was plausible.",
      "Valieva, now 18, was the headliner on the team that finished first in the Olympic team figure skating event at the 2022 Beijing Games but ended up with the bronze medal after her result was scrubbed because of the doping positive. Her suspension ends late in 2025 and reports are that she will return to competition in time for next year's Milan-Cortina Olympics.",
      "In a filing this week to the court, Valieva\u2019s attorneys write: \u201cThe production of Professor Saugy\u2019s report by (WADA) confirms the procedural fraud that motivated the request for review.\u201d",
      "They claim WADA did not disclose the experiment to CAS, which would have added a theory for Valieva\u2019s positive test for scant traces of the drug and also subjected Saugy to cross-examination at the hearing, and when they finally did hand it over, it had been altered to look less favorable for Valieva.",
      "WADA spokesman James Fitzgerald said \u201cany allegation of wrongdoing on WADA\u2019s part is completely rejected\u201d and that the agency would \u201cvigorously defend its position in this matter.\u201d",
      "He said the report \"was not WADA\u2019s document to share\u201d and wouldn\u2019t have been covered by discovery obligations.",
      "\u201cThe report was not helpful to Ms. Valieva\u2019s case and, anyway, would have had no impact on the result as the Court of Arbitration for Sport Panel ultimately rejected the athlete\u2019s strawberry dessert explanation, not based on the scientific plausibility but rather because it was not supported by sufficient factual evidence,\u201d Fitzgerald said.",
      "In contamination cases such as the one that ruined the then 15-year-old\u2019s 2022 Olympics and painted her as the helpless pawn of powerful Russian coaches and sports leaders, the athlete has the burden of proving how the drug got into their system.",
      "CAS arbitrators labeled as \u201cinherently implausible\u201d the idea that Valieva would have taken the smoothie her grandpa made on a long train ride and eaten it over a period of days.",
      "Saugy did not respond to AP\u2019s request for an interview.",
      "In the experiment, the scientist tried to replicate conditions under which the grandfather said he made the smoothie by crushing pills on a wooden cutting board that had not been cleaned.",
      "Saugy made estimates on how much residue from the pills, combined with its mingling with the fruit on the same cutting board, could have ended up in the smoothie Valieva claimed she drank on a train from Moscow to St. Petersburg, where she went to compete in December 2021.",
      "\u201cDepending on the quantity and the time of ingestion of this contaminated food by the athlete, the scenario cannot be excluded,\u201d Saugy wrote of the theory that Valieva could have accidentally ingested the drug.",
      "Saugy also included that finding in his conclusion at the end of the report. But further down in that four-paragraph section, he wrote that \u201cthe voluntary intake of a dose of Trimetazidine 4 to 5 days before the antidoping test stays the most plausible scenario.\u201d",
      "In arguing the report was altered, Valieva's attorneys say Saugy\u2019s experiment \u2014 which included breakdowns of how the drug metabolizes in a person's system \u2014 did not support the theory that the scant amount of the drug in Valieva's system at the time of her positive test could have resulted from intentional use of the drug.",
      "\u201cThis additional conclusion, which is unrelated to the purpose of the expert appraisal and the questions posed, contradicts the rest of the report,\u201d the lawyers said.",
      "They also point out that the original request, sent by a WADA deputy director at RUSADA\u2019s request, contains eight questions, while the report only includes Saugy's answers to the first seven. The excluded question: \u201cHow did the TMZ enter the athlete's body?\u201d",
      "\u201cIt seems clear that Professor Saugy initially answered this question and subsequently deleted his comments precisely because they were 'super favorable' to Kamila Valieva,\u201d the attorneys argue, in repeating the phrasing used by WADA's director general when he expressed alarm over the experiment.",
      "The drug Valieva tested positive for, Trimetazidine, is the same one that showed up in the systems of 23 Chinese swimmers who were not penalized after WADA accepted that country\u2019s contamination explanation for their positive tests.",
      "That case brought harsh scrutiny on WADA \u2014 the U.S. government stopped paying its dues to the drug-fighting organization \u2014 and the Valieva case illustrates a disconnect between how WADA handled scenarios involving different countries whose athletes tested positive for the same drug and made similar contamination claims.",
      "Valieva\u2019s case was the latest chapter in a saga that, at the time, had dragged on for eight years. Russian sports leaders had been found to be cheating the system at the highest levels, and also lying to WADA when it came asking for evidence of the malfeasance.",
      "Russia\u2019s anti-doping agency was non-compliant at the time the Valieva case played out, which forced it to run the request for Saugy\u2019s experiment through WADA.",
      "WADA, therefore, received the results of the test, and that alarmed director general Olivier Niggli, whose texts to Gunther Younger, the head of the agency\u2019s new intelligence and investigations unit, were seen by the AP.",
      "\u201cIf it is a RUSADA opinion, we should absolutely not be involved in anyway,\u201d Niggli wrote. \u201cThis is a big issue on our side to get involved in such an opinion that will be used in court. We have to stop that urgently.\u201d",

      "The New York Yankees showed they can still win with a little scruff on their chins while Baltimore's Tyler O'Neill might be the best player on Earth during the first game of the season.",
      "And to no one's surprise, Japanese star Shohei Ohtani delivered more big hits for the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers as Major League Baseball celebrated its domestic opening day with 14 games on Thursday.",
      "New York's Carlos Rod\u00f3n \u2014 sporting a well-kept short beard \u2014 gave up just one run over 5 1/3 innings while striking out seven, leading the Yankees to a 4-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers. In February, the Yankees announced that they were ending their 49-year ban on beards.",
      "O'Neill went deep for a sixth straight opening day to extend his own record, connecting for a three-run homer in the Orioles' 12-2 win over the Toronto Blue Jays. He finished 3 for 3 with two walks and three runs scored.",
      "Even more special, the Canadian was able to play in his home country for the first time on opening day.",
      "Ohtani hit a solo homer and scored twice for the Dodgers, who improved to 3-0 this season with a 5-4 win over the Detroit Tigers. The Dodgers beat the Cubs twice in Tokyo to open the season on March 18 and 19.",
      "Here are a few more highlights from the first day of the six-month MLB season:",
      "Austin Wells became the first catcher to hit a leadoff homer on opening day, sparking the Yankees to their win over the Brewers.",
      "It was a good day in New York after a rough spring in Florida.",
      "The Yankees were hit hard with injuries during Grapefruit League play, losing ace Gerrit Cole for the season after learning he needed Tommy John surgery. Slugger Giancarlo Stanton (sore elbows), reigning AL Rookie of the Year pitcher Luis Gil (lat strain), right-hander Clarke Schmidt (shoulder fatigue) and infielder DJ LeMahieu (left calf strain) also start the season on the injured list.",
      "None of that mattered against the Brewers. New closer Devin Williams \u2014 an All-Star acquired from the Brewers in a December trade \u2014 worked out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam to seal the win.",
      "O'Neill's record-extending homer was just one facet of Baltimore's potent offense. The Orioles went deep six times in their lopsided win over the Blue Jays, including two homers for both catcher Adley Rutschman and center fielder Cedric Mullins.",
      "Rutschman's power display is a good indicator that he's ready to bounce back from a slightly disappointing 2024 season when he hit .250 with 19 homers. The two-time All-Star and former No. 1 overall pick finished with three hits.",
      "The Chicago White Sox took advantage of a much-needed fresh start, beating the Los Angeles Angels 8-1.",
      "The White Sox were coming off a 41-121 record last season, which set the post-1900 major league record for losses in a season. Chicago's still expected to be in rebuilding mode this summer, but at least for one day, the White Sox looked like an improved bunch.",
      "Sean Burke threw six scoreless innings, Andrew Benintendi, Lenyn Sosa and Austin Slater all hit homers and Will Venable won his MLB managerial debut.",
      "For the Angels, it was their 11th opening day loss in 12 years.",
      "Nolan Arenado is still in St. Louis and still a very good baseball player.",
      "Arenado hit a solo homer in the Cardinals' 5-3 win over the Minnesota Twins, saluting the home crowd with a curtain call.",
      "The Cardinals tried to trade the eight-time All-Star third baseman during the offseason, but nothing worked out, so the 33-year-old is back at Busch Stadium's hot corner \u2014 at least for the time being.",
      "There's no way the Los Angeles Dodgers go 162-0 this season, right?",
      "Right?",
      "Well, they're 159 wins away after beating the Tigers on Thursday. The big-budget Dodgers have delivered so far in the early season, looking every bit the favorite to win back-to-back World Series titles for the first time since the Yankees won three straight from 1998 to 2000.",
      "Ohtani hit his second homer of the season, going deep in the seventh. Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez hit a three-run homer and two-time Cy Young award winner Blake Snell pitched well in his Dodgers debut, giving up two runs over five innings after signing a $182 million, five-year deal during the offseason.",
      "Miami's Sandy Alc\u00e1ntara gave up two runs over 4 2/3 innings in a 5-4 win against the Pirates in a solid return after missing the entire 2024 season after Tommy John surgery. Alc\u00e1ntara was the 2022 NL Cy Young award winner. Pittsburgh's Paul Skenes, who won the NL Rookie of the Year award last season, countered by giving up two runs over 5 1/3 innings. ... Fernando Tatis Jr. had three hits and Manny Machado added two doubles as the Padres beat the Braves 7-4. ... Wilmer Flores hit a three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning, and the San Francisco Giants rallied for a 6-4 victory over Cincinnati, spoiling Terry Francona\u2019s debut as Reds manager. ... New Mets star Juan Soto struck out with two on base in the ninth to end New York's 3-1 loss to Houston. Soto signed a record $765 million, 15-year deal during the offseason. ... Washington's MacKenzie Gore struck out a career high 13 batters against Philadelphia, but the Phillies rallied for a 7-3 win. Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber went deep for the Phillies. ... Boston's Wilyer Abreu dedicated a two-homer game to his newborn twin boys. Abreu went deep twice in Boston\u2019s season-opening 5-2 win at Texas, including a tiebreaking three-run shot in the ninth. ... Catcher Miguel Amaya had two doubles and five RBIs to lead the Cubs past the Diamondbacks 10-6.",

      "Captain Rajat Patidar\u2019s 51 led Bengaluru to 196-7 despite Afghan left-arm spinner Noor Ahmad claiming the key wicket of Phil Salt in the powerplay and Virat Kohli\u2019s in the middle overs. Kohli struggled to 31 off 30 balls.",
      "A revamped Bengaluru pace attack comprising of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Josh Hazlewood clipped Chennai in the first six overs and the home team limped to 146-8.",
      "Bengaluru, which has never won the IPL, has got off to a perfect start with two big away wins against defending champion Kolkata Knight Riders and five-time champion Chennai.",

      "Devdutt Padikkal kept the scoreboard ticking at over nine an over with a breezy 27 off 14.",
      "But Chennai wasted at least three opportunities to dismiss Patidar, and Kohli\u2019s scratchy innings ended when he couldn\u2019t clear Ravindra at deep midwicket.",
      "Patidar hit three sixes and four boundaries before Matheesha Pathirana struck twice in the penultimate over which cost Chennai just one run from a wide ball. Pathirana had Patidar finally caught at cover off a full delivery.",

In addition, the high-level recruits who were lured to town by the presence of Sanders figure to be staying, too.",
      "Should Sanders take another job \u2014 in the NFL or another NCAA team \u2014 his buyout is $12 million if he terminates the deal on or before December 31, 2025; $10 million in 2026, $6 million in 2027, $4 million in 2028 and $3 million in 2029.",
      "Among his incentives are $150,000 if the Buffaloes win nine games in the regular season and $100,000 for each additional victory in the regular season.",
      "He also receives $150,000 if the team plays in the Big 12 title game and $150,000 if Colorado is invited to a non-college football playoff bowl. It\u2019s $400,000 should the team win the conference championship or appear in the first round of the College Football Playoff. A first-round win earns him another $50,000. From there, it's $100,000 for the semifinals; $200,000 for the championship game and $250,000 if the Buffaloes win the national championship.",
      "His selection as the Big 12 Coach of the Year would earn him $75,000 and the national award $150,000.",
      "He\u2019s certainly helped raise the profile of Colorado since taking over:",
      "\u2014 22 of Colorado\u2019s 24 games have been selected to be on network television or the flagship ESPN.",
      "\u2014 The two highest average home attendance seasons have been 2023 (53,180 fans) and last season (52,514).",
      "\u2014 Colorado was sixth in viewership during the 2024 regular season, trailing only Georgia, Ohio State, Alabama, Texas and Michigan.",
      "\u2014 The football team generated $31.2 million in ticket sales in Sanders' first season in Boulder (a 4-8 record), according to the annual University of Colorado athletics NCAA financial reports. The program had $13 million in ticket sales the year before his arrival.",
      "\u2014 Colorado has seen its applications to attend the school increase 20% from a year ago.",
      "\u2014 Home football games have meant a combined $93.9 million in direct economic impact for Boulder and $146.5 million in regional economic impact, according to the school.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think that anybody fully was prepared for just how much national and international attention Coach Prime would generate for our community and the economic benefits that it would also engender,\u201d John Tayer, the president and CEO of the Boulder Chamber, recently said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s just a great deal of enthusiastic energy.\u201d",
      "The success has carried over into the classroom as well. The football team had a GPA of 3.011 for the fall semester. It's the first time the football program has been over 3.0, the school announced.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just scratched the surface of what this program can be,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \"It\u2019s not just about football; it\u2019s about developing young men who are ready to take on the world. I\u2019m committed to bringing greatness to this university, on and off the field. We\u2019ve got work to do, and I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else but here, making history with these incredible players and this passionate fan base.",

      "The governing body of figure skating has embarked on an ambitious plan called \u201cVision 2030,\u201d and the idea is simple: Make the sport cool again",
      "BOSTON -- Ashley Wagner and Ben Agosto know what it's like to step off the ice at the figure skating world championships and feel as though they've conquered the sport. And what it feels like when the notoriously fickle sport bites back.",
      "So when the International Skating Union put in motion its ambitious \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan, which is designed to grow and expand the sport through improved fan engagement, it made sense that they would call Wagner, a three-time U.S. champion and former world silver medalist, and Agosto, who won an Olympic silver medal with ice dance partner Tanith Belbin.",
      "If anyone was going to interview athletes at this week's world championships at such an emotionally raw moment, the minute after their programs have concluded, it ought to be someone who has been through it themselves.",
      "\u201cI would have loved this when I was an athlete, to have the post-skate interviews right in the kiss-and-cry, when the emotions are so fresh,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat's something being brought into this production. We've never seen anything like it.\u201d",
      "Look closely, and you might notice a lot of things never seen before at this week's worlds: cutting-edge LED dasher boards surrounding the rink, grand entrances for the athletes, and more energetic music \u2014 like the rocked-out version of \u201cI'm Shipping Up to Boston\u201d by the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys that keeps blaring inside TD Garden.",
      "The idea is simple: The ISU wants to make figure skating feel cool again.",
      "Or at least, cool to more people.",
      "Those who love the intricate, nuanced sport \u2014 the spins and jumps, the brilliant landings and bitter falls \u2014 tend to follow it year-round. But there are just as many fans that tune in once every four years, during the Winter Olympics, when like a shooting star the athletes spring onto the public consciousness and then fizzle as soon as it ends.",
      "\"Skaters are the reason why this sport exits,\" explained ISU president Jae Youl Kim, who granted The Associated Press a behind-the-scenes tour of the world championship setup Thursday, shortly before the start of the men's short program.",
      "\u201cWe are so proud of our athletes and we want to make sure we shine a brighter, stronger spotlight on our skaters.\u201d",
      "That is why those brilliant LED dasher boards are showcasing each athlete's social media tag, and why each is being introduced individually for the first time, something track and field and other Olympic sports have embraced over the years.",
      "The ISU wants to create a spectacle for the 14,000-plus fans in the arena, along with the millions watching around the world.",
      "\u201cThere's much more to come. I mean, we can brainstorm here a lot about potential marketing and sponsorship activations as well,\u201d said Wieland L\u00fcders, who manages the world championships for the ISU. \u201cEach skater has their own partners, potentially, so there are many more thoughts. But for now, we are just at the beginning. This is the basic concept.\u201d",
      "In the future, the Vision 2030 plan hopes to improve the TV presentation, simplify the sport\u2019s complex rules, increase sponsorship and expand revenue streams. It will also promote skating through grassroots initiatives, reimagine the season-long calendar, and explore new technology that could help to usher the sport into the modern era.",
      "The athletes aren't just benefiting from increased exposure, and the potential boon for their pocketbooks, but also from back-of-the-house upgrades that are a part of Vision 2030. In Boston, an expansive lounge is off limits to everyone but competitors, and back at their hotel, there is a calming room complete with a rotating cast of therapy dogs.",
      "Kim visited it this week. Nobody paid any attention to the ISU president because everybody wanted to see Penny, the dog.",
      "If the calming room is meant to destress, the new hot seat in the arena will probably do the exact opposite.",
      "Much like the time trial in Olympic cycling, where the leader sits uncomfortably on a throne until someone else takes the lead, the ISU has created the same thing at the world championships. But rather than some roped-off backstage area, where leaders have waited for decades, the hot seat is right next to the kiss-and-cry area in the heart of the arena.",
      "The athletes who are coming off the ice after their performance can't help but stare down whomever is in the lead.",
      "\u201cWe want the fans to see how that person is reacting when he or she climbs over to take the throne, or how they are reacting when they cannot make it,\u201d L\u00fcders said. \u201cThey could have interactions with each other, some hugging or high-fives, something like this. So we hope we get more engagement between the two skaters.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, more engagement with the fans, too.",

    "story": [
      "Red Bull has dropped Liam Lawson as the teammate of Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen just two rounds into the season and replaced him with Yuki Tsunoda",
      "Red Bull dropped Liam Lawson as the teammate of Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen after just two rounds of the season and replaced him with Yuki Tsunoda on Thursday.",
      "Lawson was given the Red Bull seat despite not having previously driven a full F1 season and struggled immediately. The New Zealander did not score any points, crashed out of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix and qualified in last place for the Chinese Grand Prix and its sprint race.",
      "Tsunoda moves up from Red Bull\u2019s second team, Racing Bulls, in time for his home Japanese GP next week. Lawson will take Tsunoda\u2019s place at Racing Bulls alongside rookie Isack Hadjar.",
      "The change is a sign of how cut-throat F1 can be and an admission that Red Bull made the wrong choice in picking Lawson. He completed only 11 career F1 races before this season and was typically slower than Tsunoda across their six races as teammates last year.",
      "\u201cIt has been difficult to see Liam struggle with the (car) at the first two races and as a result we have collectively taken the decision to make an early switch,\u201d Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe came into the 2025 season with two ambitions, to retain the world drivers\u2019 championship and to reclaim the world constructors\u2019 title and this is a purely sporting decision.\u201d",
      "Horner acknowledged there was work to be done with the team\u2019s RB21 car and said Tsunoda\u2019s experience will prove beneficial in helping to develop it.",
      "\u201cWe have a duty of care to protect and develop Liam and, together, we see that after such a difficult start it makes sense to act quickly so Liam can gain experience, as he continues his F1 career with Racing Bulls, an environment and a team he knows very well,\u201d Horner said.",
      "Replacing Lawson so quickly is in stark contrast to the patience shown Verstappen\u2019s former teammate Sergio Perez, who was handed a two-year contract extension midway through a disappointing 2024 season. The team eventually dropped Perez for Lawson in December after four years.",
      "Lawson spoke publicly about his difficulties with the RB21 car, saying on Sunday it was \u201ctricky\u201d to drive and had a \u201cvery small window\u201d for the setup to be competitive. That echoed comments from Perez last year that the car became increasingly difficult to handle as Red Bull\u2019s development work leaned toward Verstappen\u2019s driving style.",
      "The 24-year-old Tsunoda has been in F1 since 2021 with a career-best championship placing of 12th last year and has yet to finish on the podium. He\u2019s previously faced criticism within the broader Red Bull operation for a tendency to vent his frustrations over the radio during races.",
      "Tsunoda\u2019s long-term future is complicated by his personal backing from Honda, which is being replaced as Red Bull\u2019s engine supplier at the end of the year ahead of a new deal with Ford from 2026. Honda will supply Aston Martin next season.",
      "Racing Bulls team principal Laurent Mekies said he was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of Tsunoda for making the move to Red Bull. \u201cHis progress last year, and more recently from the very start of 2025, has been nothing less than sensational,\u201d he said.",
      "Tsunoda becomes Verstappen\u2019s sixth teammate in 10 seasons with Red Bull. It\u2019s the first time that the main Red Bull team has changed drivers midseason since 2019 when Pierre Gasly was dropped for Alex Albon after 12 races.",
      "Verstappen is the only Red Bull driver to win a race in almost two years and the only one on the podium in nearly a year. He\u2019s scored all of the team\u2019s points in the four races since Perez placed 10th in Las Vegas in November.",

      "Raised in Moscow within the Soviet sports system by parents who were accomplished athletes, Alex Ovechkin was given every chance to succeed at hockey and along the way showed he didn\u2019t need special treatment",
      "Alex Ovechkin almost stopped playing hockey.",
      "His mother, Tatyana, was a basketball player, his father, Mikhail, was a soccer player and they were traveling with their teams, leaving no one to take young Alex to practice. Coach Vyacheslav Kirillov begged Tatyana to get him back in the sport until she gave in.",
      "Good thing, too. When Ovechkin was 12 and playing in a competitive Moscow youth league. he realized he needed three goals to break a record set by Pavel Bure. He scored six times the next game.",
      "A few years later, other parents thought putting Ovechkin on the first line with Dynamo was favoritism because his parents worked for the club, so Tatyana asked the coach to demote him. He made the fourth line the team's best.",
      "Raised in the final years of the Soviet sports system by parents who were already accomplished athletes, Ovechkin was given every chance to succeed and, along the way, showed he didn't need special treatment. He evolved into a superstar on the ice and the top NHL draft pick by the Washington Capitals in 2004.",
      "Over the past 20 years, he became a Stanley Cup champion who celebrated by swimming in fountains \u2014 he has long been known as a fun-loving person \u2014 and teammates watched him develop into a husband, father and a generous person paying for dinners on the road and growing reflective on his career and accomplishments. Next on that list will be breaking Wayne Gretzky's career goals record.",
      "\u201cHe was a very, very bright young man in terms of his goal-setting for his life,\" said Hockey Hall of Famer Igor Larionov, who met Ovechkin as a teenager. \"He was determined. He was one of the fastest players on the ice, and he had a purpose. Every time he stepped on the ice, he was going to be the best.\"",
      "Born Sept. 17, 1985, and coming of age just as the Soviet Union was giving way to a new Russia, Ovechkin was drawn to the game through his father. If Mikhail's gifts had a bigger impact, his son might have been more like goaltender Vladislav Tretiak than a power forward and pure scorer.",
      "\"He would go on some trips and bring me some goalie helmets,\" Ovechkin once recalled. \"I didn\u2019t know what it was, except it was something about hockey, and when I was a little kid everything was about hockey, hockey, hockey.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin embraced hockey and showed he was good at it. When marketing executive Steven Warshaw went to Moscow in the 1990s to work for the Pittsburgh Penguins after they invested in a team there, he heard all about the next generation of Russian stars.",
      "\u201cThey give them everything they can -- the best coaching, the best everything,\u201d Warshaw said. \u201cHe was definitely given a jump start as all great athletes are, especially when you have the lineage.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin was 14 when Larionov, by that time already a three-time Cup champion, sat with him in the locker room and shared some advice about doing extra summer training and committing to training in the gym.",
      "\u201cHe knew at home from the parents, from mom and dad, to be successful you have to be determined to do extra things off ice, on ice and follow the right steps,\u201d Larionov said. \"It\u2019s synergy between genetics from his parents, his approach to the game, his drive, his fire, his power that made him a great player.\u201d",
      "At 17, Ovechkin scored a tournament-best six goals in seven games to help Russia repeat as world junior champions and was again the leading scorer the following year as he emerged as the top prospect in the NHL draft, just ahead of countryman Evgeni Malkin.",
      "The lockout that wiped out the 2004-05 season delayed Ovechkin's North American arrival, but on his first shift Ovechkin hit an opponent so hard he dislodged the partition holding the plexiglass together. He also scored career goal No. 1, then goal No. 2 on the way to getting 52 of them and becoming rookie of the year.",
      "\u201cHe was actually making giant, massive steps toward stardom and started scoring goals, got his confidence,\u201d Larionov said. \"The Washington Capitals got the right players around him to kind of fit him and use his biggest strength, power, speed and shot.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin led the NHL in goals and points in 2008-09, helping the Capitals make the playoffs in his third season and first of three as NHL MVP.",
      "Ovechkin still visits Russia, usually annually, and he has been criticized for his relationship with Vladimir Putin after expressing support for the Russian president in November 2017 ahead of an election. At the time, he told The AP and Washington Post, \u201cI just support my country\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about political stuff.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin was surrounded by young talent in his early years in Washington. Center Nicklas Backstrom, defenseman Mike Green and winger Alexander Semin joined and made hockey in the nation's capital must-see entertainment. They were also having plenty of fun off the ice.",
      "\u201cHe should\u2019ve been out having his fun and having a new car every other week,\u201d retired teammate Mike Knuble said. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of like, \u2018Oh, what car\u2019s he driving this week?\u2019 And just having a good, old time doing whatever he wanted to do and just playing hockey and bagging individual awards.\u201d",
      "In a sport that defines players for winning championships, Knuble worried that Ovechkin would be known only for the individual accomplishments because the playoff success wasn't coming. The Capitals went through a series of changes from the front office to the coaching staff and the roster, culminating with Ovechkin leading them to the Stanley Cup in 2018 as playoff MVP.",
      "\u201cHe just didn't want to let it go,\u201d Backstrom said of the Cup.",
      "Even though Ovechkin was 32, he and the Capitals celebrated like few teams in recent history. They famously swam in the Georgetown fountains \u2014 a plaque now marks the spot \u2014 and the entire run showed the best of Ovechkin.",
      "\u201cA big heart like a big kid,\u201d longtime teammate John Carlson said. \u201cHe loves coming to the rink and he loves scoring goals and playing like we did when we were kids.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin changed off the ice, too. He and Nastya Shubskaya married in 2016, and the couple had even more reason to celebrate the summer of 2018 when she gave birth their first son, Sergei, that August. Ilya, was born in the spring of 2020, and the boys have been right there with their dad for many of his big moments since.",
      "When Ovechkin scored his 801st and 802nd goals just before Christmas 2022, to pass Gordie Howe for second on the all-time list, he walked into the locker room hand-in-hand with Sergei and Ilya and put them on his lap to take photos.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, you have to think about your family, kids first, Nast, me,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cIt changed 100%.\u201d",
      "At 2023 All-Star Weekend in South Florida, possibly Ovechkin's last appearance at one of those, Sergei joined him on the ice in a matching \u201cOvi Jr.\u201d jersey with, of course, his dad's signature No. 8.",
      "\u201cHe will remember that for all his life,\u201d Ovechkin said.",
      "Knuble has enjoyed seeing Ovi the dad take this in maybe even more than the goal-scorer. Tom Wilson, a teammate since 2013, now a father and likely to succeed Ovechkin as captain, has witnessed the growth firsthand \u2014 joining them for family vacations and seeing him as a family man, playing \u201cDance Dance Revolution\u201d with his nephews and nieces.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s never a dull moment,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "Even at home, where Ovechkin enjoys spending time with his wife, kids and their 9-year-old black lab, Blake.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t think about hockey,\u201d he said. \"You don\u2019t think about the training or practice. You just enjoy your life, enjoy your time with the kids, with family, with friends and you can basically do whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Backstrom met Ovechkin nearly two decades ago before either was 21. The fun times, the Cup win and hundreds of goals between them have come and gone.",
      "\"He\u2019s always been the same,\" Backstrom said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t changed a lot since the first time I met him: the same kind of outgoing person.\u201d",
      "Former teammate Nate Schmidt called Ovechkin \u201cunapologetically himself.\u201d Marcus Johansson, who played his first seven NHL seasons with Washington and had another stint with the Capitals, said Ovechkin is inviting, has \u201cgot a big heart and he takes care of the people around him.\u201d",
      "That's what current center Dylan Strome tells friends and folks back home when they ask what Ovechkin is like.",
      "\u201cVery, very, very generous with his time, his money \u2014 going out of his way for people,\u201d Strome said. \u201cHe always wants to be with the guys, whether it\u2019s watch sports or just talk or whatever or have a couple beers, he\u2019s always in for that.\u201d",
      "Carlson believes the 39-year-old Ovechkin has stayed young as the age gap between veterans and young teammates in the locker room grows, while at the same time appreciating each moment a little more. Wilson has seen Ovechkin sign dozens of pucks, sticks and jerseys for other teams after a game without the slightest hesitation.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t even really describe him in words,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a guy that\u2019s bigger than life, bigger than hockey. A personality that whenever he does hang them up, the game will miss him a lot.\u201d",

      "SUN VALLEY, Idaho -- Mikaela Shiffrin's flashbacks to her November crash in a giant slalom race are happening less and less when she's training.",
      "For her, as she deals with post-traumatic stress disorder in the discipline, that's major progress.",
      "While other racers compete in the GS on Tuesday at World Cup finals in Sun Valley, Shiffrin plans to squeeze in some training in the slalom. It will be the American standout's only event of the weeklong finals after not qualifying in giant slalom.",
      "The two-time Olympic champion revealed last month that she\u2019s suffering from PTSD after falling in the GS on Nov. 30 in Killington, Vermont. In the crash, something punctured Shiffrin's side and caused severe trauma to her oblique muscles.",
      "Shiffrin skipped the giant slalom at world championships and has raced the discipline three times since, with her best showing 25th place.",
      "But she's back to turning in fast sections at practice in the GS, a discipline that blends speed and technical skill.",
      "\u201cTraining is going well. It\u2019s actually super positive. Training has been improving day-by-day,\u201d Shiffrin said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday before signing autographs for fans. \u201cI'm just trying to get back to the confidence that I was skiing with in Killington when the crash happened. That would be a big goal.\u201d",
      "On that day, Shiffrin was leading after the first run of the GS as she charged after her 100th World Cup win. The finish line was in sight on her final run, when she lost an edge and slid into a gate, flipping head over skis.",
      "The all-time winningest Alpine World Cup ski racer then slammed into another gate before coming to a stop in the protective fencing. She still doesn't know what led to the puncture wound.",
      "To help with getting back in the giant slalom start gate, she's been working with a psychologist. Leading into world championships and the GS, she checked most of the boxes for PTSD symptoms. A few weeks later in Are, Sweden, she checked fewer.",
      "\u201cMy processing speed and the mind-body connection has come back in a great way,\u201d explained Shiffrin, who earned her 100th World Cup win last month in Italy. \"But every now and then I\u2019ll still have the sort of intrusive images or thoughts cross my mind of crashing or the pain. Normally, it\u2019s in the start gate. If I\u2019m starting to get a little bit tired in a session, I just imagine everything that could go wrong and it\u2019s kind of an intense reaction.",
      "\u201cBut it happens so much less often now. It does feel very true that simply exposure to doing the thing that\u2019s pretty uncomfortable is helpful.\u201d",
      "Following her slalom training session Tuesday, Shiffrin will be watching as New Zealand\u2019s Alice Robinson tries to hold off Italy\u2019s Federica Brignone for the crystal globe in the giant slalom.",
      "The 30-year-old Shiffrin can see glimpses of her GS form returning. She won an Olympic gold medal in the discipline at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games and 22 of her 100 World Cup victories have come in giant slalom.",
      "\u201cSome of my turns are competitive with the fastest in the world,\u201d said Shiffrin, whose slalom race is Thursday. \u201cBut putting that together for a minute and 10-second GS run \u2014 that just takes time and repetition. We\u2019ll need to try to get some days this summer with long course sets, with a lot of variation of course sets, variation of conditions. I don\u2019t doubt that I can get to that competitive level again.",
      "\"I think a lot of my skiing is already there.\u201d",

      "Former UFC champion Cain Velasquez has been sentenced to five years in prison for a shooting in 2022 where he chased after the man accused of molesting his son",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Former UFC champion Cain Velasquez was sentenced to five years in prison Monday for a shooting in 2022 where he chased after the man accused of molesting his son.",
      "Velasquez was sentenced in Santa Clara County after he pled no contest to attempted murder, felony assault, and other related gun charges last August for what the district attorney's office called a \u201cvigilante shooting spree.\u201d He will receive credit for time served.",
      "In February 2022, the two-time UFC heavyweight champion fired a gun multiple times at a truck carrying three people, including 46-year-old Harry Goularte, who is facing felony child molestation charges, according to the district attorney's office.",
      "His defense attorney, Renee Hessling, called the result \u201cbittersweet\u201d as they had hoped to keep Velasquez out of prison.",
      "\u201cThroughout it all, Cain has shown courage and strength of character,\" Hessling said in a statement. \u201cHe has taken responsibility for his actions and has been held accountable. The sentence handed down today reflects the complexities of the situation and acknowledges the man behind the headlines.\u201d",
      "Less than a week prior to the shooting, Goularte was arrested in connection to the sexual assault of a 4-year-old at the daycare owned by his family. He was released without bail a few days later. Officials said he was released under house arrest and was on his way to retrieve an electronic monitoring bracelet when Velasquez attacked.",
      "Velasquez shot at Goularte's truck in a car chase that lasted for 11 miles (17.7 kilometers), the district attorney\u2019s office said. Goularte was uninjured, but his stepfather, who was driving, was hit twice.",
      "Velasquez has said the sexual assault incident involved his child and is suing Goularte and his family\u2019s daycare for negligence and sexual battery.",
      "On his former teammate Kyle Kingsbury's podcast, Velasquez said the way he handled the situation was \u201cnot the way to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe cannot put the law in our own hands,\" Velasquez said. \"I know what I did, and I know what I did was very dangerous to other people, you know? Not just to people involved, but innocent people. I understand what I did and I\u2019m willing to do everything I have to, to pay that back.\u201d",
      "Velasquez also said it was important to have open and honest with your kids about what kind of behavior is acceptable and listen to what they say.",
      "\u201cOne man\u2019s decision to take the law into his own hands left an innocent man wounded and endangered schoolchildren, teachers, and many others in our community,\" District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement. \"If you want to do justice in Santa Clara County, please apply for a badge.\u201d",

      "The 34-year-old Brignone entered the day 20 points behind Robinson in the last World Cup giant slalom race of the season. Robinson struggled with a gate in her first run, veered off course and didn't finish, paving the way for Brignone.",

      "Tests are underway at Cortina\u2019s controversial Olympic sliding track",
      "ROME -- When Italian skeleton competitor Mattia Gaspari became the first athlete to test the controversial sliding track for next year's Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, he did so in a sort of tunnel under a temporary roof built of wooden beams and white plastic paper.",
      "That's because the sliding center in Cortina d'Ampezzo is still under construction and the only part that is really finished is the track structure.",
      "Still, getting to this point little more than a year after construction began is a big achievement for the Italian government, which rebuilt the century-old track despite calls from the International Olympic Committee to hold bobsled, luge and skeleton athletes at a venue in nearby Austria or Switzerland instead.",
      "\u201cIt's really been quite an adventure,\u201d Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI want to thank the construction firm, which was the first one to believe in this, and the journalists who motivated us,\u201d said Salvini, who is also the deputy premier, citing articles claiming that the project would never be done. \u201cWell, here we are.\u201d",
      "Olympic bronze medalist Dominik Fischnaller was the second athlete down the track on his luge before Simone Bertazzo and Eric Fantazzini made a two-man bobsled run.",
      "Simico, the government agency in charge of the 118 million euro ($128 million) project, reported positive results for the test runs. But it will be officials from the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, International Luge Federation and the IOC to determine whether to bestow preliminary certification \u2014 homologation is the technical word \u2014 for the track.",
      "Preliminary approval would be a big step in avoiding a backup Plan B option that the IOC had demanded and which would require moving the three sliding sports all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy wasn\u2019t finished in time. Lake Placid officials were hopeful that, if the sliding events were going to be awarded to the U.S., the official word would come by the end of March.",
      "Construction on the Cortina track began in February last year. The pre-homologation plan calls for athletes to begin their initial runs from the junior start, well below the ramps from where they would begin to race for World Cup and Olympic competitions. Sliders would move up the track slowly throughout the coming days.",
      "There are testing events at the Cortina track for all three sliding sports \u2014 bobsled, skeleton and luge \u2014 scheduled for throughout the fall. Those are important so that sliders can familiarize themselves with the track and feel safe there when competing at the Olympics. Safety has taken on more importance since the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training crash hours before the start of the opening ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Games.",
      "Luge athletes are scheduled to have an international training period at the new track from Oct. 27 through Nov. 2, then return for a test event there in the final week of November. The bobsled and skeleton tours will hold their international training period from Nov. 7-16, followed by the season-opening World Cup races there from Nov. 17-23.",
      "The 1.749-kilometer (1.09-mile) track features 16 curves with an estimated top speed of 145 kph (90 mph) with run times slated for 55-60 seconds.",
      "Athletes from 12 nations are involved in the tests this week. It's about 60 athletes in all, about half of them being Italian sliders. Coaches representing at least 23 different sliding nations were also invited to view this week's events.",

      "Duke guard Tyrese Proctor has made 13 of 16 3-pointers through two games of the NCAA Tournament",
      "It wasn't that long ago that Tyrese Proctor was struggling to make much of anything outside the arc. Shot after shot clanged away in a befuddling stretch of misses spanning nearly a month of the stretch run for Duke's national-title contender.",
      "Now he can't miss.",
      "The junior guard has been on an absolute tear with his outside shot, hitting at least six 3-pointers for the past three games going back to the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament final. It's been a boost to an offense already humming at elite efficiency as the top-seeded Blue Devils head into Thursday's matchup with Arizona in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament's East Region in Newark, New Jersey.",
      "\u201cI think the main thing is the mentality of it,\" Proctor said after Sunday's second-round win against Baylor. \"I'm just shooting knowing the ball is going to go in and not hoping it's going in as the big thing.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-6 guard from Australia has made 19 of 28 3-pointers (67.9%) since missing his first two attempts in the ACC title-game win against Louisville. And he's only gotten hotter with each passing possession.",
      "First came a 6-for-8 output in the first round against Mount St. Mary's \u2014 the kind of shooting display that's typically more of a one-game blip than a sustained push.",
      "Only he topped that two days later, making 7 of 8 against the Bears.",
      "That's 13 for 16 through two March Madness games, a shocking 81.3% hit rate. The 13 made 3s are the most of any player in the Sweet 16, with Houston's LJ Cryer and Tennessee's Chaz Lanier each hitting 10 as the only other players to reach double figures so far.",
      "And Proctor is striking from a variety of ways: on the catch in transition, curling around a screen, using a stepback, even pump-faking a defender off his feet and then resetting off a single dribble to his right \u2014 a move he pulled three times to send a Baylor player flying by on Sunday.",
      "As he kept burying the Bears, he flashed triumphant gestures and unleashed I'm-feeling-it screams toward a home-state crowd as he retreated back to the defensive end.",
      "\u201cSuch a talented player, such a weapon for us when he\u2019s being confident looking for his shot,\u201d freshman star Cooper Flagg said.",
      "The Blue Devils (33-3) have long counted on Proctor as a starter with perimeter length, giving him the ability to create matchup problems at both ends for smaller guards. He has long been a complementary scorer behind Flagg and another freshman in Kon Knueppel, and was averaging 11.8 points entering the Louisville game.",
      "But his kicked-up offense behind that 3-point shot through the last three games has increased his scoring average by approaching a full point (12.5).",
      "It was hard to see this coming as recently as 10 days ago.",
      "After a strong start to February, Proctor's outside shot suddenly abandoned him. Over the next seven games, he would miss 23 of 29 3-pointers, including a pair of 0-for-5 days to start the ACC Tournament. By the time he missed his first two against Louisville in the final, Proctor had missed 14 straight 3s going back to missing his last two in the regular-season finale at rival North Carolina.",
      "Proctor spent time looking at film of his shot with assistant Will Avery after the first two games of the ACCs, trying to decipher where things were misfiring.",
      "\u201cIt's just little things \u2014 just my balance and stuff like that,\" Proctor said. \"At the end of the day, it's just confidence. As soon as my feet get set and I hold my follow-through, I'm just going to keep trusting it.",
      "\"All the 0-for, whatever it was, all that felt good. A couple of them I knew what I did wrong. I think it's just realizing and understanding that, and just fixing it on the fly is a big thing.\u201d",
      "It's a challenge any shooter can understand: finding a delicate balance of tweaking any deficiencies showing up in the form, yet not meddling too much with what has worked for so long.",
      "So far it's working.",
      "\u201cIt's hard, earlier this season I struggled with that,\" Knueppel said. \u201cYou've just got to keep shooting it, that's the only way you can make more shots, is you keep shooting them. So he's done a great job of just being confident. He's really attacking his catches and getting locked and loaded, and ready to go.\u201d",

      "This Kentucky team is a little different from any other in its storied history, which is why Butler\u2019s tournament experience with San Diego State has been so essentially.",
      "Kentucky (24-11) didn\u2019t return a single player who scored a point for the Wildcats last season. New coach Mark Pope essentially built a roster from scratch. Nine transfers had to get accustomed to playing together.",
      "Butler emerged as the leader of the group. Kentucky teammate Andrew Carr referenced it before the tournament when he jokingly referred to Butler as \u201cLaMarch.\u201d",

And Lamont did that because that\u2019s who he is. He cares.\u201d",

      "Butler is averaging 11.1 points and 4.3 assists \u2013 career highs in both categories \u2013 despite dealing with a left shoulder injury dating to mid-January that cost him six games. He hurt it again in the Southeastern Conference Tournament and didn\u2019t play in a quarterfinal loss to Alabama.",
      "Butler returned for a 76-57 first-round NCAA victory over Troy and didn\u2019t score at all, but he still contributed in so many other ways that he had a plus-minus rating of plus-22. Butler, who has been wearing a brace on the shoulder, had 14 points and five assists in an 84-75 second-round triumph over Illinois.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really a dog,\u201d Kentucky guard Otega Oweh said. \u201cGoing out there with one arm and giving it his all. He\u2019s playing defense, and on top of that, he\u2019s getting us into our offense. When you have someone that\u2019s doing that, it just trickles down. You just want to out there and fight for him, too.\u201d",
      "Butler had three of Kentucky\u2019s 14 steals against Illinois. After the game, Kentucky guard Koby Brea had a simple explanation for why the Wildcats were able to force Illinois into so many turnovers.",
      "\u201cWe have Lamont Butler as the head of defense,\u201d Brea said. \u201cSo I feel like for any team, when you see him pick you up, it has to put something in your stomach, some nerves or something.\u201d",
      "Butler scares his opponents while calming his teammates. He\u2019s providing the presence this team full of transfers needed as they try to get Kentucky back to the Final Four for the first time in a decade.",
      "\u201cI think everybody is hungry this year,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI feel like a lot of us came from smaller schools or different places and we were able to compete at one of the best schools ever. We all wanted to be remembered here.\u201d",
      "Butler already was going to be remembered for that shot he hit two years ago. Now he\u2019s creating a whole new set of memories while wearing a different uniform.",

      "The NFL competition committee is recommending making the dynamic kickoff rule permanent and moving touchbacks to the 35-yard line in hopes of generating even more returns.",
      "The competition committee released several potential rule changes for 2025 on Wednesday, including an expansion of instant replay that will be considered next week at the league meetings in Palm Beach, Florida. Any rule change must be approved by 24 out of 32 team owners.",
      "Teams submitted several proposals last week that also could be voted on at the league meetings, including banning the \u201ctush push\u201d and changing playoff seeding rules.",
      "Owners approved a major change to the kickoff last year on a one-year trial basis and the committee recommended another change to increase the rate of returns without increasing the risk of injuries. The league had 332 additional returns last season with the rate increasing from a record-low 21.8% in 2023 to 32.8% last season.",
      "The committee hopes that moving the touchback on kicks that reach the end zone on the fly from the 30 to the 35 will incentivize kicking teams to opt for shorter kicks that lead to more returns.",
      "The committee also proposed allowing teams to declare their intention for an onside kick at any point in the game when they are trailing instead of only in the fourth quarter.",
      "The committee proposed a few other tweaks to how players on the return team can align before the kick but the basics will remain the same with the kicker lining up at his own 35, the 10 coverage players at the 40, and at least nine blockers lined up in the \u201csetup zone\u201d between the 30- and 35-yard line and up to two returners in the landing zone inside the 20.",
      "Any kick that reaches the end zone in the air can be returned, or the receiving team can opt for a touchback, which now will be at the 35.",
      "Only the kicker and two returners are allowed to move until the ball hits the ground or is touched by a returner inside the 20.",
      "According to the NFL, there were 59 returns of at least 40 yards last season, the most in the league since 2016, and seven TD returns. The concussion rate fell 43% from the previous three years and there were the fewest lower-extremity strains on kick return plays since 2018.",
      "The committee also proposed an expansion of instant replay to allow replay assist to consult on-field officials to overrule objective calls such as facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles or tripping if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn't occur. Replay would also be able to overturn a roughing the kicker or running into the kicker penalty if video replay showed the defender made contact with the ball.",
      "The committee also proposed allowing two players to be designated to return from injured reserve if they are placed on IR when rosters are reduced to 53, granting playoff teams two more return from IR spots in the postseason, and using point differential as the third tiebreaker on waiver claims.",

      "There almost certainly won\u2019t be a $700 million deal for any player in the baseball\u2019s next free agency class, nothing like the record contracts for two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and four-time All-Star slugger Juan Soto the past two winters",
      "There almost certainly won't be a $700 million deal for any player in the baseball's next free agency class, nothing like the record contracts for two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and four-time All-Star slugger Juan Soto the past two winters.",
      "Still, plenty of talented players are going into their final seasons before potentially becoming free agents for the first time.",
      "Vladimir Guerrero Jr., five-tool player Kyle Tucker and starting pitchers Dylan Cease, Framber Valdez and Zac Gallen could all become available to other teams after this season. Three-time batting champion Luis Arr\u00e1ez and Bo Bichette, who twice led the American League in hits, could also be first-time free agents.",
      "Guerrero, like Soto already a four-time All-Star and Home Run Derby champion at age 26, had set a self-imposed deadline for negotiating a long-term agreement with Toronto. That passed at the start of spring training without a new deal, when he said he wanted to stay but would listen to other teams in free agency.",
      "Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro remained optimistic going into the season that the team would eventually sign the first baseman to a contract extension.",
      "Soto\u2019s $765 million, 15-year contract with the New York Mets in December came after Ohtani got a $700 million, 10-year deal from the Los Angeles Dodgers the previous offseason. Guerrero told ESPN in an interview after his deadline passed that he was seeking a similar contract length as Soto but noted that his last offer was for less than $600 million.",
      "Here are some of the players eligible for free agency after this year\u2019s World Series:",
      "Guerrero, who will make $28.5 million this season, hit a career-best .323 last year with a .940 OPS, 30 homers and 103 RBIs in his fourth consecutive All-Star season. Over six seasons with the Blue Jays, he has a .288 average with 160 homers and 507 RBIs in 819 games. He finished second in the 2021 AL MVP voting behind unanimous choice Ohtani.",
      "Houston clearly wasn't planning to pay the price to keep Tucker in free agency, so the Astros traded the three-time All-Star and Gold Glove-winning right fielder to Chicago in December for a third baseman, starting pitcher and top prospect outfielder that are all under team control for multiple seasons. The 28-year-old Tucker was limited to 78 games last year because of a fractured right shin, and still hit 23 homers. He had a combined 59 homers, 219 RBIs and 55 stolen bases in 2022-23.",
      "The 29-year-old Cease has 130 starts over the last four seasons, twice finishing in the top four in Cy Young Award voting. He was the AL runner-up behind unanimous winner Justin Verlander while with White Sox in 2022, and fourth in the NL last year when 14-11 with a 3.47 ERA in 33 starts after being traded to the playoff-bound Padres during spring training from a Chicago team that went on to lose 121 games. Cease has 1,016 career strikeouts in 847 1/3 innings.",
      "One of the game's best left-handed starters, the 31-year-old Valdez has a 68-41 career record and is Houston's opening-day starter for the fourth year in a row. He was 15-7 with a 2.91 ERA in 28 games last season, his fifth in a row to finish with a winning record. The workhorse threw a no-hitter in 2023 and averaged more than 191 innings the past three years.",
      "The 29-year-old Gallen, 14-6 last year, is 43-19 with a 3.20 ERA in 93 starts the past three seasons. Arizona got him his rookie season in 2019 when it traded Jazz Chisholm Jr. to Miami. The Diamondbacks just gave 2021 NL Cy Young Award winner and four-time All-Star right-hander Corbin Burnes a $210 million, six-year deal, the richest in franchise history. That could significantly impact whether they will also be able to keep Gallen, twice a top-five finisher in Cy Young voting.",
      "Arr\u00e1ez has back-to-back 200-hit seasons, part of three batting titles in a row while finishing each of those seasons with a different team. The Padres acquired him last year in a midseason trade from Miami, which got him from Minnesota after his first batting title with the Twins in 2022. He goes into this season with a .323 career average and only 194 strikeouts in 2,858 career plate appearances.",
      "A calf injury and then a broken right middle finger limited Bichette to 81 games last season, and the 27-year-old two-time All-Star hit a career-low .225 with only four homers. Before that, he led the AL in hits in 2021 and 2022, and batted .306 in 2023 during his third consecutive 20-homer season.",
      "Ozuna, who turns 35 next November, played in all 162 games for the first time last year and was an All-Star for the third time \u2014 first since 2016. He has 79 homers and 204 RBIs over the past two years.",
      "Bieber had 20 strikeouts in 12 scoreless innings last season before Tommy John surgery and becoming a free agent for the first time. Cleveland re-signed the 2020 AL Cy Young winner even though he won\u2019t pitch until later this season, during which the pitcher with a 62-32 career record turns 30. He does have a $16 million player option for 2026.",
      "34-year-old catcher J.T. Realmuto, 32-year-old slugger Kyle Schwarber and 29-year-old left-handed starter Ranger Su\u00e1rez are going into the final seasons of their contracts with the Phillies after being key figures for three consecutive playoff seasons. That began with that 2022 NL pennant that ended a decade-long postseason drought. Schwarber has 131 homers and 302 RBIs in that three-season span, along with 318 walks and 612 strikeouts.",

      "And then, they\u2019ll be on opposite sides \u2014 just like they were in his final weeks as a member of the team.",
      "The Heat will pay tribute to Butler\u2019s 5\u00bd seasons with the team with a pregame video on Tuesday night, one that will be shown in the arena as part of the introduction of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 starting lineup for the game.",
      "Butler said he\u2019ll watch the video, though added that it didn\u2019t matter to him whether the Heat did one or not. He\u2019s insisting that there\u2019s no hard feelings now, a month and a half after he was traded to the Warriors following a contentious breakup that saw him suspended by Miami three times in his final weeks with the team.",
      "He wasn\u2019t happy with the Heat, not getting an extension and had issues with his role. The Heat weren\u2019t happy with how he missed about 25% of their games during his tenure with the club and how he took his complaints public in the final months.",
      "Butler got his extension \u2014 two years, $111 million \u2014 from the Warriors, and Golden State was 16-3 in his first 19 appearances with the team entering Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always painted as the bad guy,\u201d Butler said. \u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve always been a problem. We\u2019ll take it. I don\u2019t got nothing to say. I\u2019m not mad at being a bad guy. It\u2019s all the way everything\u2019s portrayed. Some people talk to the media, some people don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been one to tell my side of the story to almost anybody. Let everybody think that this is what happened. We\u2019ll ride with it.\u201d",
      "Fans, as they tend to be when a top player leaves their team, have not been shy about hiding their anger with Butler on social media. Butler knows things didn\u2019t end well in his Miami tenure, though notes that he believes there\u2019s more than enough blame to go around for the messy breakup.",
      "\u201cI wonder if they look at the Heat the same way,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t like I was the one who was doing everything. It\u2019s got to be 50-50, maybe 51-49 \u2014 49 towards them, 51 towards me. But there\u2019s no way that I was the cause of all of this.\u201d",
      "Butler wound up being suspended for a total of 14 Heat games before the trade. But the Heat have a tradition of welcoming back players who were All-Stars or champions with the team; Butler was an All-Star in Miami who led the team to three Eastern Conference finals berths and two trips to the NBA Finals.",

      "There just may not be as many players like them in the future with more teams opting for flexible posts who play on the perimeter and shoot 3-pointers. Plus, that is how players are now often being taught at younger ages.",
      "\u201cAll these young ladies are getting more skilled. They\u2019re able to step away from the basket. They are able to face up and play,\u201d Kansas State coach Jeff Mittie said. \u201cI think, as you\u2019re seeing youth basketball progress, that they\u2019re getting more training earlier, where not just to stand in the paint and play. ... The game has evolved.\"",
      "Even so, these women are excelling inside during this March Madness.",
      "The 6-foot-7 Betts had 30 points and 14 rebounds for top-seeded UCLA in a second-round win over Richmond. The junior has made 63.6% of her 825 career field goal attempts over three years, and has a Bruins single-season record 90 blocked shots.",

      "While UCLA coach Cori Close agrees that the game is evolving, the Bruins \u2014 who next play fifth-seeded Ole Miss on Friday night \u2014 certainly take full advantage of having their dominant center.",
      "\u201cSo it just has this domino effect, but it starts with her,\u201d Close said. \u201cThe reality for us is that if she gets a touch \u2014 people work possessions all the time just to create rotation. Like how are we going to do this, create rotation, flatten out their defense, force them to be in a scramble mode. We have a really good way. We just pass it to Lauren and force that every single time.\u201d",
      "Lee was a second-team AP All-American as a junior in 2022, the same year she set an NCAA single-game record with 61 points against Oklahoma, but missed all of the following season because of a knee injury. Her 64.1% field goal percentage this season is a career high, while averaging 15.6 points and 6.4 rebounds playing fewer than 19 minutes a game.",
      "\u201cI definitely have been a more traditional post, and that\u2019s just where my strength lies,\" Lee said. \u201cOur coaches and our team have done a good job of building a strong guard presence around that. So I haven\u2019t really had to really step out much.\u201d",

      "Campbell was previously an Oregon assistant and overlapped some of Prince's time there. Nyara Sabally was then the prominent player inside for the Ducks, but the coach wanted Prince to dominate inside for the Horned Frogs.",
      "\u201cMe and Sedona have had healthy dialog of trying to figure out how to impose her will in games,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIf I let her, she would stay on the perimeter and shoot 3s all game. ...

      "Prince made the only 3 she has attempted since Christmas, and is 8 for 28 from long range in her career. Neither Betts nor Lee have shot any 3s.",
      "\u201cI was a passer and a shooter (at Oregon), and that\u2019s why I got really good at that like 12- to 15-foot range shot,\" Prince said. \"So coming here, Mark and I had the conversation of like, you need to get really, really good at catching the ball deep in the post and making simple post moves, but take advantage of being 6-7, getting stronger.

      "A major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar shook the Earth as far as Bangkok",
      "Early Friday, a major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar, shook the Earth as far as Bangkok, about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) away.",
      "Two hard-hit cities in Myanmar suffered extensive damage, with images from the capital, Naypyidaw, showing rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of collapsed buildings. Authorities in Bangkok said deaths had occurred at three construction sites, including a high-rise that collapsed.",
      "Experts say the earthquake, which occurred along the Sagaing Fault, was close to the Earth's surface, generating intense seismic forces. Preliminary estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey show that nearly 800,000 people in Myanmar may have been within the zone of the most violent shaking and that death tolls exceeding 1,000 people, and perhaps much higher, are probable.",
      "The Earth's crust is broken up into several pieces called tectonic plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.",
      "This formation is \u201cmostly stable, but along the edges they are moving,\u201d Columbia University geophysicist Michael Steckler said.",
      "Pressure builds up when sliding plates get stuck, increasing \u201cvery slowly for decades or for hundreds of years, and then all of a sudden the rock plates will jump,\" triggering shaking that causes an earthquake, Steckler said.",
      "Earthquakes typically occur along edges of tectonic plates. But their impacts may be felt in a broader region.",
      "Earthquakes that occur in the ocean don't always attract attention, but those that occur close to where people live can cause deaths and injuries, most often from collapsed buildings.",
      "Scientists have a good idea of where earthquakes are likely to occur, \"but we can't predict when they'll occur,\u201d USGS seismologist Will Yeck said.",
      "However, after the initial big earthquake, researchers are able to project that other smaller earthquakes nearby, called aftershocks, are likely.",
      "Aftershocks are triggered \u201cbecause of changes to stress in the Earth from the main shock,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "Given the magnitude of the quake in Myanmar, \u201cyou will probably see aftershocks for the next several months,\u201d Steckler said.",
      "In regions of the world with known active fault lines, including California and Japan, building codes are often designed to withstand earthquakes. But that's not true everywhere.",
      "\u201cIf you feel shaking, the guidance depends on where you are in the world,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, if you're inside when an earthquake occurs, it's advisable to drop to the ground, cover your head \u2014 for example, by crawling under a desk or other sturdy structure \u2014 and hold onto that structure, he said. Try to avoid areas near glass windows and don't use building elevators.",
      "If you're outside, try to remain in an area away from buildings or trees that could fall.",
      "Depending on the location, there may be secondary hazards triggered by earthquakes, such as landslides, fires or tsunamis, he said.",

      "The United States has given an initial approval for the energy-rich Mideast nation of Qatar to buy eight armed MQ-9B Predator drones for its military, an estimated purchase worth nearly $2 billion",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The United States has given an initial approval for the energy-rich Mideast nation of Qatar to buy eight armed MQ-9B Predator drones for its military, an estimated purchase worth nearly $2 billion.",
      "The State Department approval announced early Thursday for Qatar comes after Doha had been trying to purchase the drones during the Biden administration, but hadn't gotten the OK despite serving as an interlocutor for Washington to the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran's theocracy and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The immediate approval under President Donald Trump serves as a far-different starting point for his government's relations with Qatar \u2014 particularly after he initially backed a four-nation boycott of Doha during his first term.",
      "\u201cThis proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East,\u201d the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.",
      "Qatar's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Qatar is the second-largest purchaser of U.S. military equipment after Saudi Arabia, spending over $26 billion for F-15 fighter jets, Apache attack helicopters, missile defense systems and other gear.",
      "The proposed sale now goes to the U.S. Congress. Lawmakers typically weigh in on such sales and, in some cases, can block them.",
      "Under terms of the sale, Qatar would purchase eight of the drones, as well as hundreds of bombs and missiles to arm the pilotless aircraft with and the equipment necessary to fly them by satellite.",
      "General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and have an endurance of more than 30 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over the Middle East for years, in Afghanistan, Iraq and now over Yemen during the American bombing campaign there. The drone has a land and sea version.",
      "The initial approval for Qatar, however, comes after the nearby United Arab Emirates has been waiting since 2020 to purchase up to 18 MQ-9 drones as part of a $23 billion deal also including advanced F-35 fighter jets. Trump has a particularly close relationship with the UAE, which reached a diplomatic recognition deal with Israel under his administration in 2020.",

      "The governing body of figure skating has embarked on an ambitious plan called \u201cVision 2030,\u201d and the idea is simple: Make the sport cool again",
      "BOSTON -- Ashley Wagner and Ben Agosto know what it's like to step off the ice at the figure skating world championships and feel as though they've conquered the sport. And what it feels like when the notoriously fickle sport bites back.",
      "So when the International Skating Union put in motion its ambitious \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan, which is designed to grow and expand the sport through improved fan engagement, it made sense that they would call Wagner, a three-time U.S. champion and former world silver medalist, and Agosto, who won an Olympic silver medal with ice dance partner Tanith Belbin.",
      "If anyone was going to interview athletes at this week's world championships at such an emotionally raw moment, the minute after their programs have concluded, it ought to be someone who has been through it themselves.",
      "\u201cI would have loved this when I was an athlete, to have the post-skate interviews right in the kiss-and-cry, when the emotions are so fresh,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat's something being brought into this production. We've never seen anything like it.\u201d",
      "Look closely, and you might notice a lot of things never seen before at this week's worlds: cutting-edge LED dasher boards surrounding the rink, grand entrances for the athletes, and more energetic music \u2014 like the rocked-out version of \u201cI'm Shipping Up to Boston\u201d by the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys that keeps blaring inside TD Garden.",
      "The idea is simple: The ISU wants to make figure skating feel cool again.",
      "Or at least, cool to more people.",
      "Those who love the intricate, nuanced sport \u2014 the spins and jumps, the brilliant landings and bitter falls \u2014 tend to follow it year-round. But there are just as many fans that tune in once every four years, during the Winter Olympics, when like a shooting star the athletes spring onto the public consciousness and then fizzle as soon as it ends.",
      "\"Skaters are the reason why this sport exits,\" explained ISU president Jae Youl Kim, who granted The Associated Press a behind-the-scenes tour of the world championship setup Thursday, shortly before the start of the men's short program.",
      "\u201cWe are so proud of our athletes and we want to make sure we shine a brighter, stronger spotlight on our skaters.\u201d",
      "That is why those brilliant LED dasher boards are showcasing each athlete's social media tag, and why each is being introduced individually for the first time, something track and field and other Olympic sports have embraced over the years.",
      "The ISU wants to create a spectacle for the 14,000-plus fans in the arena, along with the millions watching around the world.",
      "\u201cThere's much more to come. I mean, we can brainstorm here a lot about potential marketing and sponsorship activations as well,\u201d said Wieland L\u00fcders, who manages the world championships for the ISU. \u201cEach skater has their own partners, potentially, so there are many more thoughts. But for now, we are just at the beginning. This is the basic concept.\u201d",
      "In the future, the Vision 2030 plan hopes to improve the TV presentation, simplify the sport\u2019s complex rules, increase sponsorship and expand revenue streams. It will also promote skating through grassroots initiatives, reimagine the season-long calendar, and explore new technology that could help to usher the sport into the modern era.",
      "The athletes aren't just benefiting from increased exposure, and the potential boon for their pocketbooks, but also from back-of-the-house upgrades that are a part of Vision 2030. In Boston, an expansive lounge is off limits to everyone but competitors, and back at their hotel, there is a calming room complete with a rotating cast of therapy dogs.",
      "Kim visited it this week. Nobody paid any attention to the ISU president because everybody wanted to see Penny, the dog.",
      "If the calming room is meant to destress, the new hot seat in the arena will probably do the exact opposite.",
      "Much like the time trial in Olympic cycling, where the leader sits uncomfortably on a throne until someone else takes the lead, the ISU has created the same thing at the world championships. But rather than some roped-off backstage area, where leaders have waited for decades, the hot seat is right next to the kiss-and-cry area in the heart of the arena.",
      "The athletes who are coming off the ice after their performance can't help but stare down whomever is in the lead.",
      "\u201cWe want the fans to see how that person is reacting when he or she climbs over to take the throne, or how they are reacting when they cannot make it,\u201d L\u00fcders said. \u201cThey could have interactions with each other, some hugging or high-fives, something like this. So we hope we get more engagement between the two skaters.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, more engagement with the fans, too.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Fans of Studio Ghibli, the famed Japanese animation studio behind \u201cSpirited Away\u201d and other beloved movies, were delighted this week when a new version of ChatGPT let them transform popular internet memes or personal photos into the distinct style of Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki.",
      "But the trend also highlighted ethical concerns about artificial intelligence tools trained on copyrighted creative works and what that means for the future livelihoods of human artists. Miyazaki, 84, known for his hand-drawn approach and whimsical storytelling, has expressed skepticism about AI's role in animation.",
      "Janu Lingeswaran wasn't thinking much about that when he uploaded a photo of his 3-year-old ragdoll cat, Mali, into ChatGPT's new image generator tool on Wednesday. He then asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, instantly making an anime image that looked like Mali but also one of the painstakingly drawn feline characters that populate Miyazaki movies such as \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d or \u201cKiki's Delivery Service.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really fell in love with the result,\u201d said Lingeswaran, an entrepreneur who lives near Aachen, Germany. \u201cWe're thinking of printing it out and hanging it on the wall.\u201d",
      "Similar results gave the Ghibli style to iconic images, such as the casual look of Turkish pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec in a T-shirt and one hand in his pocket on his way to winning a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics. Or the famed \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d meme of a 4-year-old turning to the camera with a slight smile as a house fire rages in the background.",
      "ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is fighting copyright lawsuits over its flagship chatbot, has largely encouraged the \u201cGhiblification\u201d experiments and its CEO Sam Altman changed his profile on social media platform X into a Ghibli-style portrait. In a technical paper posted Tuesday, the company had said the new tool would be taking a \u201cconservative approach\u201d in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists.",
      "\u201cWe added a refusal which triggers when a user attempts to generate an image in the style of a living artist,\u201d it said. But the company added in a statement that it \u201cpermits broader studio styles \u2014 which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations.\u201d",
      "Studio Ghibli in Japan declined to comment Friday.",
      "As users posted their Ghibli-style images on social media, Miyazaki\u2019s previous comments on AI animation also began to resurface. When Miyazaki was shown an AI demo in 2016, he said he was \u201cutterly disgusted\u201d by the display, according to documentary footage of the interaction. The person demonstrating the animation, which showed a writhing body dragging itself by its head, explained that AI could \u201cpresent us grotesque movements that we humans can\u2019t imagine.\u201d It could be used for zombie movements, the person said.",
      "That prompted Miyazaki to tell a story.",
      "\u201cEvery morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability,\u201d Miyazaki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can\u2019t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can\u2019t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is.\u201d",
      "He said he would \u201cnever wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cI strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,\u201d he added.",
      "Josh Weigensberg, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman, said that one question the Ghibli-style AI art raises is whether the AI model was trained on Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli\u2019s work. That in turn \u201craises the question of, \u2018Well, do they have a license or permission to do that training or not?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "OpenAI didn\u2019t respond to a question Thursday about whether it had a license.",
      "Weigensberg added that if a work was licensed for training, it might make sense for a company to permit this type of use. But if this type of use is happening without consent and compensation, he said, it could be \u201cproblematic.\u201d",
      "Weigensberg said that there is a general principle \u201cat the 30,000-foot view\u201d that \u201cstyle\u201d is not copyrightable. But sometimes, he said, what people are actually thinking of when they say \u201cstyle\u201d could be \"more specific, discernible, discrete elements of a work of art,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cA \u2018Howl\u2019s Moving Castle' or \u2018Spirited Away,\u2019 you could freeze a frame in any of those films and point to specific things, and then look at the output of generative AI and see identical elements or substantially similar elements in that output,\u201d he said. \u201cJust stopping at, \u2018Oh, well, style isn\u2019t protectable under copyright law.\u2019 That's not necessarily the end of the inquiry.\u201d",
      "Artist Karla Ortiz, who grew up watching Miyazaki\u2019s movies and is suing other AI image generators for copyright infringement in a case that\u2019s still pending, called it \u201canother clear example of how companies like OpenAI just do not care about the work of artists and the livelihoods of artists.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s using Ghibli\u2019s branding, their name, their work, their reputation, to promote (OpenAI) products,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult. It\u2019s exploitation.\u201d",
      "Ortiz was further enraged when President Donald Trump\u2019s administration jumped into the meme trend Thursday, using the White House\u2019s official X account to post a Ghibli-style image of a weeping woman from the Dominican Republic recently arrested by U.S. immigration agents. The White House and OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on how the image was made.",
      "\u201cTo see something so brilliant, as wonderful as Miyazaki\u2019s work be butchered to generate something so foul,\u201d Ortiz wrote on social media, adding that she hoped Studio Ghibli sues \u201cthe hell out of\u201d OpenAI for this.",

      "Businesses and lawmakers are trying to address the U.S. affordable housing crisis by turning to alternative ways to build homes",
      "DENVER -- As Americans struggle under backbreaking rental prices, builders are turning to innovative ways to churn out more housing, from 3D printing to assembling homes in an indoor factory to using hemp \u2014 yes, the marijuana cousin \u2014 to make building blocks for walls.",
      "It's a response to the country's shortfall of millions of homes that has led to skyrocketing prices, plunging millions into poverty.",
      "\"There\u2019s not enough homes to purchase and there\u2019s not enough places to rent. Period,\" said Adrianne Todman, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under former President Joe Biden.",
      "One way to quickly build more is embrace these types of innovations, Todman said. \u201cI can only imagine what our housing situation would be like now if we could have made a decision to be more aggressive in adopting this type of housing.\"",
      "So what are these new ways of building homes? And can they help reduce the cost of new housing, leading to lower rents?",
      "In a cavernous, metal hall, Eric Schaefer stood in front of a long row of modular homes that moved through the plant, similar to a car on an assembly line.",
      "At a series of stations, workers lay flooring, erected framing, added roofs and screwed on drywall. Everything from electrical wiring to plumbing to kitchen countertops were in place before the homes were shrink-wrapped and ready to be shipped.",
      "The business in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Fading West, has pumped out more than 500 homes in its just over three years of operation, each taking just five to seven days to build, even in the coldest winter months, Schaefer said.",
      "Once assembled in the plant, the narrow townhouse-style homes with white trim, balconies and front porches, are about 90% done. At their final destination they are move-in ready within six weeks, Schaefer said.",
      "The company works with towns, counties and housing nonprofits to help address the shortage of affordable homes, mostly for workers who've been squeezed out by sky-high prices in ritzy mountain towns.",
      "That includes Eagle, Colorado, not far from the Vail ski resort, where Fading West worked with Habitat for Humanity to install modular homes at affordable rents for teachers and other school district employees. The homes tend to be on the smaller side, but can be multifamily or single family.",
      "\u201cYou can build faster. The faster you build \u2014 even at a high quality \u2014 means the lower the price,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cWe see this as one of the pieces to the puzzle in helping solve the affordable housing crisis.\"",
      "There's a hefty upfront cost to build the factory, and part of the challenge is a lack of state and federal investment, he said. A patchwork of building codes governing how a structure can be built also makes it difficult, requiring changes to the construction depending on the town or county it is being sent to.",
      "Manufactured housing is similar to modular housing, but the units are constructed on a chassis \u2014 like a trailer \u2014 and they aren't subject to the same local building codes. That's part of the reason they are used more broadly across the U.S.",
      "Roughly 100,000 manufactured homes were shipped to states in 2024, up from some 60,000 a decade earlier, according to Census Bureau data. Estimates of modular homes built annually often put them below 20,000.",
      "Yes, there's technology to 3D print homes.",
      "A computer-controlled robotic arm equipped with a hose and nozzle moves back and forth, oozing lines of concrete, one on top of the other, as it builds up the wall of a home. It can go relatively quickly and form curved walls unlike concrete blocks.",
      "Grant Hamel, CEO and co-founder of VeroTouch, stood inside one of the homes his company built, the wall behind him made out of rolling layers of concrete, distinct to a 3D printer. The technology could eventually reduce labor costs and the time it takes to build an abode, but is farther off than manufactured or modular methods from making a dent in the housing crisis.",
      "It's \u201ca long game, to start chipping away at those prices at every step of the construction process,\u201d Hamel said.",
      "The 3D printers are expensive, and so are the engineers and other skilled employees needed to run them, said Ali Memari, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center, whose work has partly focused on 3D printing. It's also not recognized by international building codes, which puts up more red tape.",
      "The technology is also generally restricted to single-story structures, unless traditional building methods are used as well, Memari said",
      "It's \u201ca technology at its beginning, it has room to grow, especially when it is recognized in code,\u201d Memari said. \u201cThe challenges that I mentioned exist, and they have to be addressed by the research community.\u201d",
      "Hemp \u2014 the plant related to marijuana \u2014 is being used more and more in the construction of walls.",
      "The hemp is mixed with other materials, most importantly the mineral lime, forming \"hempcrete,\" a natural insulation that's mold- and fire-resistant and can act as outer wall, insulation and inner wall.",
      "Hempcrete still requires wood studs to frame the walls, but it replaces three wall-building components with just one, said Memari, also a professor at Penn State University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Memari is now helping oversee research into making hempcrete that doesn't need the wood studs.",
      "As much as a million hemp plants to be used for hempcrete can grow on one acre in a matter of months as opposed to trees, which can take years or decades to grow.",
      "The plant is part of the cannabis family but has far less of the psychoactive component, THC, found in marijuana. In 2018, Congress legalized the production of certain types of hemp. Last year, the International Code Council, which develops international building codes used by all 50 states, adopted hempcrete as an insulation.",
      "Confusion over the legality of growing hemp and the price tag of the machine required to process the plant, called a decorticator, are barriers to hempcrete becoming more widespread in housing construction, Memari said.",
      "Still, he said, \u201chempcrete has a bright future.\"",

      "A Chinese patient is the third person in world known to be living with a gene-edited pig kidney. And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person.",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike in hopes of alleviating a transplant shortage. Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. \u2014 two pig hearts and two pig kidneys \u2013 were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving \u2013 an Alabama woman transplanted in November and a New Hampshire man transplanted in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin.",
      "Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient \"is very well\u201d and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi\u2019an told reporters in a briefing this week.",
      "Wang, part of the hospital's xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago.",
      "But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation \u2014 learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin \u2014 important for basic organ function \u2014 although not as much as human livers do.",
      "The liver is a complex challenge because of its varied jobs, including removing waste, breaking down nutrients and medicines, fighting infection, storing iron and regulating blood clotting.",
      "\u201cWe do find that it could function a little bit in a human being,\u201d Wang said. He speculated that would be enough to help support a failing human liver.",
      "In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of \u201cbridge\u201d support by externally attaching a pig liver to a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach.",
      "In China, Wang\u2019s team didn\u2019t remove the deceased person\u2019s own liver, instead implanting the pig liver near it.",

Kennedy Jr., had his Instagram account suspended in 2021 for posting misinformation about vaccine safety and COVID-19, but many of the ideas he champions have a widespread following. Critics of Dr. Mehmet Oz accused him of sometimes making misleading assertions on the talk show he used to host; Oz now is President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.",
      "A Netflix series released last month explored the story of Belle Gibson, a popular Australian wellness influencer who amassed a following talking about curing her terminal brain cancer with a healthy lifestyle and alternative medicine. In 2015, Gibson admitted to lying about having a cancer diagnosis. Australia\u2019s federal court later fined her for failing to donate money she said would go to charity through sales of her cookbook and app.",
      "With personal wellness remaining a hot topic, here are some tips health experts have for evaluating the material you see online:",
      "Most influencers have or want business relationships with companies that allow them to earn income by promoting products. The arrangements don't necessarily mean content creators don\u2019t believe in what they\u2019re marketing, but they do have a vested interest in publicizing products that may or may not work.",
      "Creators can get paid for pictures or videos that hype up a product and also earn commissions on sales through features such as affiliate links. Experts note it's therefore better to proceed with caution when someone inspires you to hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button, whether it's for natural supplements, teas with purported weight loss benefits or any other wellness products that show up in your social media feed.",
      "Research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed a sizable amount of Instagram and TikTok posts that discussed five popular medical tests mostly came from account holders with \u201csome form of financial interest\u201d in promoting the screenings.",
      "After analyzing roughly 980 posts on the two platforms, researchers said most of the posts they found were misleading and failed to \u201cmention important harms, including overdiagnosis\u201d resulting from health people having full-body MRIs or tests to detect early signs of cancer, evaluate microorganisms in the gut or measure hormone levels.",
      "Promoting dietary supplements has been a particularly lucrative exercise for many influencers, said Timothy Caulfield, a health policy and law professor at the University of Alberta. He views the supplements industry as \u201cthe backbone\u201d of health misinformation aimed at consumers and designed to fuel billions of dollars in revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where if someone is selling a supplement, it\u2019s a red flag,\u201d he said. \"I don\u2019t think it was always like that, but it certainly is now.\u201d",
      "In general, consumers should take all bold claims with a degree of skepticism, said Cedric Bryant, chief executive officer at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise. The goal of creators is to increase engagement with their content, and some influencers may be tempted to make unproven assertions to draw in more viewers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Bryant said.",
      "Some health and wellness influencers have medical training, but many do not. Before taking health tips from someone on social media, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure they have the proper expertise or at least able to share the data that led them to recommend certain products or lifestyle choices.",
      "In the fitness area, Bryant recommends checking to see if a creator holds certification from an accreditation organization and then confirming the information through the U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals database.",
      "The American Medical Association and The American Board of Medical Specialties maintain searchable databases for medical doctors, which may help verify the qualifications of creators who share their legal names and general locations. States also operate databases that allow users to check if someone is licensed to practice medicine or has been disciplined for misconduct.",
      "If an influencer holding the appropriate credentials pushes certain products, consumers still may want to consider if a brand partnership or other factors are shaping their recommendations.",
      "Federal Trade Commission guidelines that reflected the agency's interpretation of federal law directed influencers featuring specific products or services to prominently disclose any endorsements. Yet sponsorships and potential conflicts of interest are not always revealed.",
      "In 2023, the year the guidelines were issued, the FTC issued warnings to a dozen online influencers for failing to adequately disclose paid social media posts that promoted \u201csugar-containing products\u201d and aspartame, a sweetener found in diet soda, ice cream and other foods. Some of the influencers were registered dieticians.",
      "If a creator cites studies to support health and diet claims, it\u2019s best to check and see if what they\u2019re saying aligns with the latest evidence-based medical consensus.",
      "\u201cJust because somebody has an \u2018M.D.\u2019 after their name doesn\u2019t make them entirely trustworthy,\u201d said Elias Aboujaoude, a psychiatrist and Stanford University professor who studies the intersection of psychology and technology.",
      "Aboujaoude suggests double-checking health claims with traditionally reputable sources, such as major academic institutions or government health agencies. He also advised looking at studies cited by creators and assessing whether they\u2019ve been published in reputable journals and subjected to peer review.",
      "In some cases, it might be too soon to know if promising results should be trusted or not, said Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian with the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. For example, a study might show the benefits of a specific type of herb. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the findings have been replicated in other research, a requirement for treatment methods to be considered proven effective, she said.",

      "A team of about 150 restorers fuses scientific analysis and traditional techniques to clean, patch up and otherwise revive the more than 1.8 million relics in the collection of Beijing's Forbidden City",
      "BEIJING -- It's highly technical work in what looks more like a lab than a museum: A fragment of a glazed roof tile from Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City is analyzed in a state-of-the-art X-ray diffraction machine that produces images, which are then projected onto computer screens.",
      "The fragment being examined has a dark area on its surface that restorers want to understand. Their objective is to better preserve the artifacts at the sprawling imperial palace, the former home of China\u2019s emperors and its seat of power for hundreds of years.",
      "\u201cWe want to learn what the black material is,\" said Kang Baoqiang, one of the restorers at the complex, today a museum that attracts tourists from all over the world. \u201cWhether it\u2019s atmospheric sediment or the result of substantial change from within.\u201d",
      "About 150 workers on the team fuse scientific analysis and traditional techniques to clean, patch up and otherwise revive the more than 1.8 million relics in the museum's collection.",
      "They include scroll paintings, calligraphy, bronzes, ceramics \u2014 and, somewhat unexpectedly, ornate antique clocks that were gifted to emperors by early European visitors.",
      "Down the hall from the X-ray room, two other restorers patch up holes on a panel of patterned green silk with the Chinese character for \u201clongevity\u201d sewn into it, carefully adding color in a process called \u201cinpainting.\u201d",
      "The piece is believed to have been a birthday gift to Empress Dowager Cixi, the power behind the throne in the late 19th and early 20th century.",
      "Much of the work is laborious and monotonous \u2014 and takes months to complete.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have the big dreams of protecting traditional cultural heritage that people talk about,\" said Wang Nan, one of the restorers. \"I simply enjoy the sense of achievement when an antique piece is fixed.\u201d",
      "Now a major tourist site in the heart of Beijing, the Forbidden City is the name that was given to the sprawling compound by foreigners in imperial times because entry was forbidden to most outsiders. It's formally known as the Palace Museum.",
      "Many of its treasures were hurriedly taken away during World War II to keep them from falling into the hands of the invading Japanese army. During a civil war that brought the Communist Party to power in 1949, the defeated Nationalists took many of the most prized pieces to Taiwan, where they are now housed in the National Palace Museum.",
      "Beijing's Palace Museum has since rebuilt its collection.",
      "Restoration techniques have also evolved, said Qu Feng, head of the museum\u2019s Conservation Department, though the old ways remain the foundation of the work.",

    "story": [
      "J.D. Vance arrived in Greenland on Friday for a scaled-back visit.",
      "Vice President J.D. Vance doubled down on the Trump administration's interest in acquiring Greenland on Friday while visiting the United States' Pituffik Space Base as President Donald Trump argued the U.S. \"can't\" do without the island.",
      "Vance emphasized how Greenland is vital to U.S. national security while speaking to reporters Friday afternoon.",
      "\"Well, the president said we have to have Greenland. And I think that we do have to be more serious about the security of Greenland,\" he said. \"We can't just ignore this place. We can't just ignore the president's desires.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly suggested the U.S. should take over Greenland \"one way or the another\" for national security purposes and as he continues to emphasize Greenland's importance as China and Russia ramp up activity in the Arctic.",
      "\"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of: Do you think we can do without it? We can't,\" he claimed in the Oval Office on Friday. \"If you look at Greenland right now, if you look at the waterways, you have Chinese and Russian ships all over the place, and we're not going to be able to do that.",
      "\"We're not relying on Denmark or anybody else to take care of that situation,\" he added. \"And we're not talking about peace for the United States.\"",
      "\"Greenland's very important for the peace of the world -- not us, the peace of the entire world,\" said Trump, who made overtures about buying Greenland in his first term in office. \"And I think Denmark understands it. I think the European Union understands it. And if they don't, we're going to have to explain it to them.\"",
      "However, Vance noted that the administration \"respects the self-determination of the people of Greenland\" but that they'd be better served by the U.S. security umbrella.",
      "\"Yes, the people of Greenland are going to have self-determination,\" he said. \"We hope that they choose to partner with the United States because we're the only nation on Earth that will respect their sovereignty and respect their security -- because their security is very much our security, as these brave Americans show.\"",
      "Vance added that Denmark has not kept the people of Greenland and U.S. troops at the base safe from \"very aggressive incursions from Russia, from China and from other nations.\"",
      "\"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland. You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change,\" he said.",
      "The vice president and second lady Usha Vance arrived in Greenland on Friday for a scaled-back visit to the Pituffik Space Base, where he delivered remarks and received briefings after the couple greeted U.S. service members stationed there. While meeting with service members, J.D. Vance noted he is the first vice president to visit Greenland, saying it is \"a pretty cool thing,\" before giving an overview of the visit.",
      "\"We're talk to the command and some of the Guardians about what exactly the base does and all the important ways it contributes to national security. We're going to get a briefing, of course, about, you know, what you guys do every day,\" he said.",
      "The vice president said he was told that assignment to the base was a one-year, unaccompanied assignment, meaning service members are not able to bring their families along.",
      "\"So I know it's a lot of sacrifices, spending a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" he added. \"The Trump administration, the president is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decades. So thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "The Vances were joined on the trip by national security adviser Mike Waltz, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee. The trip was originally planned as a visit by the second lady to attend a dogsled race, but that plan was scrapped after heavy criticism.",
      "Wright told Fox News on Thursday that Greenland has tried for years to interest U.S. mining companies to develop resources there because there's not enough infrastructure to make mining economical.",
      "\"So, heck, maybe that is going to happen,\" he said. \"I think that is in the best interest of Greenland and Greenlanders, and they have expressed that for years. If the United States can have the right cooperation, I think capital can flow there, which would bring jobs and economic opportunity to Greenland and critical minerals and resources to the United States -- a win for both sides.\"",
      "The idea of Greenland becoming part of the U.S. is opposed by many in Greenland and Denmark, of which Greenland is an autonomous territory.",
      "Usha Vance was originally scheduled to make the trip to learn about Greenland's cultural heritage and attend the race before it was announced that the vice president, Waltz and Wright would join her. The trip was later scaled back to just a visit to the space base.",
      "J.D. Vance and Waltz are at the center of the scandal over the purported conversation discussing the attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen over the commercially available Signal app that inadvertently included The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, who reported details of the conversation on Monday.",
      "Officials in Greenland and Denmark have pushed backagainst the visit.",
      "Reuters reported that Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen called Trump's statements an \"escalation\" in Trump's rhetoric.",
      "\"These very powerful statements about a close ally do not suit the U.S. president,\" Poulsen told reporters in Copenhagen on Thursday. \"I need to clearly speak out against what I see as an escalation from the American side.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a post on social media the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland and Denmark ahead of the unsolicited visit, adding that the two regions will \"resist.\"",

    "summary": "An international relations expert said there are a few ways Trump could acquire Greenland, however, those options would have serious consequences to the world order.",
    "story": [
      "The available options would have serious consequences to the world order.",
      "The Trump administration remains steadfast in acquiring Greenland, despite the island's leaders refusing to give it up as Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance travel to the country on Friday.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security and international security. So, we'll, I think, we'll go as far as we have to go,\" President Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "Vance has touted Greenland\u2019s \"incredible natural resources\" in speeches that call for the territory's acquisition for its riches in gold, copper and rare earth materials.",
      "Trump's ambitions aren't far-fetched, according to an international relations expert who told ABC News that there are some avenues in which the U.S. could realistically acquire the autonomous Danish territory.",
      "However, international policy, laws and decades-long economic and political partnerships make Trump's wishes extremely improbable, according to Phillip Lipscy, professor of political science at the University of Toronto.",
      "\"This kind of rhetoric hasn't been part of U.S. foreign policymaking since World War II,\" he told ABC News. \"If the United States moves forward with this, this would be a game changer.\"",
      "Lipscy noted that while acquiring Greenland would bolster the U.S.'s security in the Arctic Circle, such a move is not needed because of NATO nations' strong military and naval presence.",
      "Annexation is not new in U.S. history, going back to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, when the U.S acquired a major portion of what is now the central part of the country was acquired in a deal with France.",
      "The last time that the U.S. was given land that became territories was when it acquired three Pacific Ocean island groups as part of the post-World War II agreement with the United Nations in 1947 known as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.",
      "That deal took years of negotiating and an agreement from several nations who worked out the geopolitical landscape of post-war Oceania.",
      "Only one of those island groups, the Marianas Islands, remains a U.S. territory.",
      "Lipscy said such deals between sovereign nations have dwindled over the decades in exchange for agreements such as limited military partnerships, trade deals and other treaties, which take far less time and help keep the sovereignty of nations.",
      "Trump and the U.S. would have to negotiate with Denmark's government for a sale or an annexation of Greenland if he were to take over the land without violating international law or using the military to take the country by force.",
      "Greenland's politics are already making any such negotiation difficult, according to Lipscy.",
      "Greenland is a self-sovereign territory of Denmark with its own elected government, with Denmark's parliament handling international matters.",
      "There has been a movement within the island to be independent from Denmark that will be a key factor in any future plans of a U.S. acquisition, according to Lipscy.",
      "\"Certainly, there may be a diplomatic solution that starts with an independent Greenland\u2026but it's difficult to see that situation,\" he said.",
      "In elections earlier this month, pro-independence parties won the most seats in parliament but neither want to be part of the U.S. Greenland is now forming a coalition government in the wake of the election.",
      "Greenland's government and its residents have loudly protested Trump since he began talking about acquiring it in December. He floated the idea earlier in his first term in 2019 but didn't pursue it.",
      "\"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders. We are not Americans, we are not Danes because we are Greenlanders. This is what the Americans and their leaders need to understand. We cannot be bought and we cannot be ignored,\" Greenland\u2019s Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede said in a Facebook post earlier this month.",
      "Egede also called Friday's visit by the Vances and other U.S. officials, including national security adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, part of a \"very aggressive American pressure against the Greenlandic community\" and called for the international community to rebuke it.",
      "The Danish government has also pushed back hard on Trump's calls to acquire Greenland and has encouraged its residents to speak out against it.",
      "\"They know well that Greenland isn't for sale. They know well that Greenland doesn't want to be a part of the United States,\" Danish Prime Mette Frederiksen said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\"The attention is overwhelming and the pressure is great. But it's in times like these that you show what fabric you're made of. You haven't let yourselves be cowed. You have stood up for who you are - and you have shown what you stand for. It has my deepest respect,\" she added.",
      "Frederiksen said that other European nations are also on Denmark's side in this back-and-forth with Trump, already hampering the ties between the U.S. and its allies since Trump regained office.",
      "Lipscy said that such a purchase would take a long time and would likely stretch long beyond Trump's term, especially if the Greenland and Danish leadership and their people continue to reject Trump's calls.",
      "If Trump continued to ignore the wishes of Greenland and Denmark, it would also strain those relationships and affect economic, national security and political alliances that have been in place since the end of World War II, Lipscy said.",
      "\"It would signal the U.S. can no longer be trusted to be a reliable partner and hold international norms,\" he said. \"No one would want to do any type of deal, partnership or negotiation.\"",
      "Trump has refused to rule out military action to take over Greenland, but Lipscy said that a full-on military acquisition would also not sit well in the domestic and international political field and, most importantly, among the American people.",
      "A poll released by the Wall Street Journal days before Trump returned to the White House found that 68% of Americans opposed the idea.",
      "\"The idea of territorial expansion is coming predominantly from the president himself and there isn't any widespread agreement on acquiring from the public or the Republican Party,\" Lipscy said.",
      "He predicted that while Trump may be \"banging the table\" more to make his goal a reality, it won\u2019t move the needle beyond his base because the general public knows that such a move would be costly and ultimately not help national security.",
      "\"I think even if the ultimate goal of the U.S. government is to secure closer ties with Greenland, the way the administration is going about with its policymaking is deeply counterproductive and unlikely to get the result they are seeking,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Republicans have expressed concerns about maintaining their U.S. House majority.",
      "In a pair of back-to-back rallies held over the phone on Thursday night, President Donald Trump praised the two Republican candidates in the upcoming special elections for Florida's 6th and 1st Congressional districts, amid recent concerns among Republicans over whether their candidate in the 6th Congressional District, State Sen. Randy Fine, can keep the seat in Republican hands.",
      "Fine has lagged behind his Democratic opponent, Josh Weil, in fundraising, and Republicans have expressed concerns about his campaign, although many still believe he will be able to hold the seat in the ruby-red district.",
      "The special election in Florida's 6th Congressional District, which is on the state's eastern coast and includes the city of Daytona Beach, is being held on Tuesday, April 1, to fill the vacancy created by former Rep. Mike Waltz when he resigned to become Trump's national security adviser.",
      "The tele-rallies also came amid broader concerns among Republicans about maintaining their razor-thin majority in the U.S. House, and on the same day that Trump asked Rep. Elise Stefanik to withdraw her nomination to be United Nations ambassador, citing \"a very tight Majority\" in the U.S. House.",
      "House Republicans currently hold a narrow majority with 218 Republicans to 213 Democrats. Speaker Mike Johnson has a two-vote cushion for his majority.",
      "Fine, at the start of the telephone rally for him, emphatically praised Trump and said he would serve in Congress as one of the president's strongest allies.",
      "\"Mr. President, I'm immensely grateful for your unwavering support, trust and confidence in me. I believe that God saved your life in Butler, Pennsylvania, so that you could save the world,\" Fine said, referencing the July assassination attempt Trump survived. \"And it will be one of the most profound honors of my life to be one of your foot soldiers as you make America great again.\"",
      "Trump praised Fine's early endorsement of him during the 2024 election cycle, adding, \"that's why Randy will always have a very open door to the Oval Office. He will be there whenever I need him, and he wants to be there whenever we need him. He wants to be there for you.\"",
      "\"I've gotten to know him under pressure situations, and he can react well under pressure. So go vote for Randy,\" Trump said later.",
      "Fine reiterated he would work to carry out Trump's agenda in Congress.",
      "\"It's not overstating things to say that your agenda is at stake in this election, and this district can't let you down. Your agenda is on the ballot on April 1,\" he said.",
      "During the earlier telephone rally supporting the Republican candidate in the 1st Congressional District, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, Trump praised Patronis' work in Florida and framed the special election as important for his own agenda.",
      "That special election, which will determine who takes the seat vacated by now-former Rep. Matt Gaetz, has gotten less concern from Republicans.",
      "\"The 1st Congressional District is special, and I won it by a lot, and Jimmy is going to win it by a lot. And remember, you're five days away from this all important special election taking place in your district on Tuesday, April 1, so April Fool's Day. So it's going to be the fool for the Democrat candidate, who happens to be terrible,\" Trump said of Patronis' Democratic opponent Gay Valimont, a gun violence prevention activist.",
      "Praising Patronis, Trump said, \"Jimmy's done an outstanding job as the chief financial officer of the state of Florida, helping to guide your state to tremendous economic success. And now he wants to keep on fighting for Florida in Congress.\"",
      "Patronis, speaking after Trump, told listeners, \"Look, if you're not fired up to hearing the president right now, then you need to get your pulse checked with President Trump and the White House. A Republican majority in Congress -- we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform this country.\"",

    "story": [
      "Judge Benjamin Settle became the second federal judge to block the policy.",
      "If allowed to go into effect, the Trump administration's new policy on transgender soldiers would be a \"de facto blanket prohibition\" that seeks \"to eradicate transgender service,\" a federal judge wrote Thursday in issuing a preliminary injunction against the policy.",
      "In a 65-page opinion issued late Thursday, U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle became the second federal judge to block the policy, which he described as discriminatory and disconnected from the goals of \"military readiness, unit cohesion, lethality, or any of the other touchstone phrases long used to exclude various groups from service.\"",
      "The Justice Department filed notice Friday that it would appeal the judge's decision.",
      "While the Trump administration had argued that the judiciary should defer to military leadership, Judge Settle -- who was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush near the height of the War on Terror -- said he is unable to condone a \"unsupported, dramatic and facially unfair exclusionary policy.\"",
      "\"The government falls well short of its burden to show that banning transgender service is substantially related to achieving unit cohesion, good order, or discipline. Although the Court gives deference to military decision making, it would be an abdication to ignore the government's flat failure to address plaintiffs' uncontroverted evidence that years of open transgender service promoted these objectives,\" he wrote.",
      "The group of seven active-duty service members who brought the lawsuit argued that the policy \"purposefully discriminates\" against soldiers based on their gender identity -- an argument that Justice Department lawyers attempted to rebut by reframing the question as a medical issue, impacting only people who suffer gender dysphoria. Judge Settle was unconvinced, writing that the policy \"uses gender dysphoria as a proxy to ban all transgender service members.\"",
      "\"The government's arguments are not persuasive, and it is not an especially close question on this record,\" he wrote, finding that each of the plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed by the policy, which would curtail their military service.",
      "Judge Settle also called out the Trump administration for seemingly disregarding the service history of the transgender soldiers who brought the case, such as the Commander Emily Shilling, a naval aviator with 19 years of service who flew 60 combat missions before becoming a Navy test pilot.",
      "\"There is no claim and no evidence that she is now, or ever was, a detriment to her unit's cohesion, or to the military's lethality or readiness, or that she is mentally or physically unable to continue her service,\" Settle wrote.",
      "\"There is no claim and no evidence that Shilling herself is dishonest or selfish, or that she lacks humility or integrity. Yet absent an injunction, she will be promptly discharged solely because she is transgender,\" wrote the judge.",

      "Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro M. Bedoya have filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia aiming to reverse President Donald Trump's decision to fire them without cause, they said.",
      "\"We are trying to vindicate the law that Congress passed, that has been in place for over a century to protect accountability and transparency at the FTC,\" Slaughter told ABC News. \"To make sure that commissioners and the work of the commission is done without fear or favor, and more specifically, that we can take on the biggest companies in America without fear of getting fired for failure to do a favor to the President's friends or donors or corporate allies.\"",
      "The FTC, which regulates major tech companies, such as Facebook and Amazon, has also recently cracked down on junk fees, including those for concert tickets and hotel resort fees and simplified the process for unsubscribing from hard-to-cancel services like gym memberships. The board usually consists of five members: three from the president's party and two from the opposition.",
      "In the termination letters last week, an official from the Trump administration informed Slaughter and Bedoya, the Democratic members, that their service at the FTC was \"inconsistent\" with the administration's policies but did not provide any further details.",
      "Slaughter and Bedoya point to a 1935 Supreme Court precedent that prohibits the president from removing FTC commissioners except for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\"",
      "\"This is a very obvious violation of the law, and we hope will be reinstated in short order,\" Bedoya said.",
      "The lawsuit demands back pay and reinstatement to their positions.",
      "In addition to Elon Musk, Trump has sought close ties with other tech CEOs, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who were invited to Trump's inauguration.",
      "The former FTC commissioners said they don't know if Trump's relationships with the heads of tech companies had anything to do with their dismissal.",
      "\"It certainly raises the specter of that kind of interference and corruption,\" Slaughter said. \"We won't know without the presence of minority commissioners at the FTC why it's taking the actions it's taking and whether they're in line with the law.\"",
      "Bedoya added, \"Some of the recent, I would say, chaotic moves from the White House are a real concern, not just for consumers, but also for the market. If you want small businesses and startups to succeed, you want a stable, predictable market where big companies can't just snuff you out, not by issuing a better product, but just throwing their weight around to stop you. That is the kind of work FTC does, and that's what I fear will go away.\"",

      "Georgia lawmakers are giving up on creating a statewide database to collect information on students who might commit violence",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia lawmakers are giving up on creating a statewide database to collect information on students who might commit violence, even as they push forward other parts of a school safety bill aimed at preventing a school shooting like the one in September at Apalachee High School.",
      "House and Senate lawmakers unveiled a compromise version of House Bill 268 on Thursday, which then passed the Senate Judiciary committee unanimously. That sets it up for final passage in the closing days of Georgia's 2025 legislative session.",
      "The push to share information was driven by the belief among many that the Barrow County school system didn\u2019t have a full picture of the warning signs displayed by the 14-year-old accused in the fatal shootings of two students and two teachers. But there was loud opposition from both Democratic and Republican constituencies that the database would create a permanent blacklist with no due process that could treat racial and religious minorities unfairly.",
      "\u201cThe reason it wasn\u2019t going to fly was pushback from all points of the political spectrum that worried about their child being stigmatized just for an accusation or an uncorroborated complaint,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cowsert, an Athens Republican representing parts of Barrow County.",
      "The compromise version also removed a requirement that all school systems set up formal threat management teams to evaluate whether students may commit violence. That approach is strongly recommended by many national experts, and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency already offers training. House Education Committee Chairman Chris Erwin, a Republican from Homer, said he was hopeful schools would voluntarily adopt the model.",
      "\u201cI think there is a knowledge out there of the importance of planning and preparing already in schools,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cSo having a full model structure for the state isn\u2019t as important as maybe we once thought it was.\u201d",
      "The measure would still require police agencies to report to schools when officers learn that a child has threatened death or injury to someone at a school. But those reports aren't mandated to become part of a student's educational record and wouldn't travel with a student if they transfer to another district.",
      "That raises questions about whether the bill addresses one of the key criticisms that followed the Apalachee shooting. School officials never became aware that a sheriff's deputy in Jackson County had interviewed Colt Gray in May 2023 after the FBI passed along a tip that Gray might have posted a shooting threat online. That report would have been forwarded to middle school officials in Jackson County under the bill, but wouldn't have followed Gray when he enrolled as a freshman in nearby Barrow County after skipping eighth grade entirely.",
      "The bill also mandates quicker transfers of records when a student enters a new school, creates at least one new position to help coordinate mental health treatment for students in each of Georgia\u2019s 180 school districts and sets up an anonymous reporting system statewide.",
      "Lawmakers on Thursday added in features of separate Senate bills that had passed. They would mandate that all Georgia public schools provide wearable panic buttons to employees. Public schools would also be required to submit electronic maps of their campuses to local, state and federal agencies once a year.",
      "The amended bill would also make adult prosecution the default when children aged 13 to 16 are charged with terroristic acts at school, any aggravated assault with a gun, or attempted murder. The Senate had originally proposed a broader range of crimes when adult prosecution would be the default. House leaders had said they didn't want to submit any more juveniles to adult prosecution.",

      "\u201cWhat I would say is we don't dispute that the president did not comply with the sentence in the statute calling for congressional notice,\u201d said DOJ attorney Jeremy Newman, who instead argued that the law does not require congressional notice.",

    "summary": "The White House on Wednesday continued to downplay and deflect criticism over a Signal group chat among top Trump administration officials.",
    "story": [
      "\"I take full responsibility,\" said National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "The White House is continuing to downplay and deflect criticism over a Signal group chat among top Trump administration officials in which plans for an airstrike on Yemen were discussed just before being executed.",
      "Democratic lawmakers are demanding an investigation and accusing key Trump defense and national security officials of revealing classified information about the Yemen plans in the March 15 group chat over an encrypted but unsecured app. The chat also included the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, who was inadvertently invited to the channel.",
      "The fallout continued to grow Wednesday as The Atlantic, which broke the story on Monday, published purported details discussed in the chat on the Yemen strike. In the new article, the magazine shared text messages sent to the group, including its editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth giving a \"TEAM UPDATE\" on pending times of the strike, \"favorable\" weather conditions in Yemen and that F-18 military jets and attack drones would carry out two strike packages.",
      "\"THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP,\" Hegseth texted at one point, noting the military time of 1415 (2:15 p.m.) for the planned strike.",
      "The magazine described Hegseth's text message as \"war plans.\"",
      "The magazine reported that Hegseth's text message was sent to the group, unwittingly including Goldberg's cellphone number, \"31 minutes before the first U.S. warplanes launched\" against militant Houthi targets.",
      "\"The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee, would not be classified. Y'all know it was a lie. That's ridiculous,\" Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said during a House Intelligence Committee hearing Wednesday as he grilled Trump officials who were on the Signal chat. \"I've seen things much less sensitive be presented to us with high classification.\"",
      "Here is what Trump administration officials have said about the contents of the group chat:",
      "The White House and the top administration officials who were on the group chat titled \"Houthi PC small group\" continued to say Wednesday that no classified information was shared in the group chat.",
      "\"The conversation was candid and sensitive, but as the President and national security advisor stated, no classified information was shared. There were no sources, methods, locations, or war plans that were shared,\" Trump's Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, said at Wednesday's House Intelligence Committee hearing. \"This was a standard update to the national security cabinet that was provided alongside updates that were given to foreign partners in the region.\"",
      "While testifying at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday, Gabbard initially declined to answer questions about the group chat, even declining to confirm if she was part of it, saying, \"I'm not going to get into specifics because this is currently under review by the National Security Council.\"",
      "But later in the hearing, Gabbard told the Senate committee members, \"There was no classified material that was shared in the Signal chat.\"",
      "Seated next to Gabbard on Tuesday, CIA Director John Radcliffe immediately confirmed that he was part of the group chat when asked.",
      "\"So, my communications, to be clear, in a Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information, to be clear,\" Radcliffe said.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., asked both Gabbard and Radcliffe to answer a series of questions about the contents of the group chat, including whether military units, weapons and timing were mentioned.",
      "Both Gabbard and Radcliffe answered that they could not recall if those subjects came up. When pressed by Kelly, Gabbard later said, \"I believe there was a discussion around targets in general,\" and Radcliffe added, \"I think that's consistent with my recollection.\"",
      "In a social media post on X Wednesday, Hegseth slammed The Atlantic's reporting, saying, \"The Atlantic released so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information.\"",
      "In an interview Tuesday night on \"The VINCE Show\" -- a conservative talk radio program hosted by Vince Coglianese -- Trump highlighted the success of the Yemen attack and said, \"No, and there weren't details, and there was nothing in there that was compromised, and it had no impact on the attack, which was very successful.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X Wednesday, noting that The Atlantic's headline on its follow-up article referred to \"attack plans\" instead of \"war plans\" the magazine initially reported.",
      "\"The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT 'war plans,'\" Leavitt wrote in her post. \"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well known for his sensationalist spin.\"",
      "Goldberg and The Atlantic reported that they \"held back specific information related to weapons and to the timing of the attacks that we found in certain texts.\" But The Atlantic said it decided to release Hegseth's text messages stating the types of weapons used and the timing of the strike to counter claims from Trump officials that no classified information was released in what it described in the article as \"a massive Trump-administration security breach.\"",
      "\"The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump -- combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts -- have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions,\" the magazine's follow-up article reads.",
      "In his testimony Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Ratcliffe said Signal was appropriately used by the group involved in the chat, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "\"So that we\u2019re clear, one of the first things that happened when I was confirmed as CIA Director was Signal was loaded onto my computer at the CIA, as it is for most CIA officers,\" Ratcliffe said as he responded to questions from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. \"One of the things that I was briefed on very early Senator was by the CIA Records Management folks about the use of Signal as a permissible work use. It is. That is a practice that preceded the current administration to the Biden administration.\"",
      "Ratcliffe added, \u201cIt is an end-to-end encryption. It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes, provided\u2026provided Senator that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels. So those were procedures that were implemented. My staff implemented those processes, followed those processes, complied with those processes.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Ratcliffe told the House Intelligence Committee that there was no misuse of the Signal app.",
      "\"I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \"And at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success.\"",
      "But several former defense and intelligence officials told ABC News that such exchanges should have never been made in such a group chat. They insisted that an exact location of a strike isn't needed for information to be damaging to national security.",
      "The details Hegseth shared in the chat were so sensitive that if leaked, they could have put troops carrying out the strike in danger because it gives the adversary time to prepare to fight back, the experts told ABC News.",
      "\"It was 100 percent classified,\" Darrell Blocker, a former CIA field operative and ABC News contributor, said of the reported text exchange, based on his three decades with a security clearance.",
      "Gabbard told the House Committee, \"The Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices. December of 2024, CISA [Certified Information Systems Auditor] stated, 'We strongly urge highly targeted individuals to immediately review and apply best practices provided in the guidance to protect mobile communications, including consistent use of end-to-end encrypted messaging apps.'\"",
      "On Tuesday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he didn't know anything about Signal and wasn't involved in the group chat.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" Trump said. \"A lot of the military, I think, successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Trump suggested that a staff member of national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently invited Goldberg to the group chat.",
      "\"And what it was, we believe, is somebody that was on the line with permission, somebody that was with Mike Waltz, worked for Mike Waltz at a lower level had, I guess Goldberg's number were called through the app, and somehow this guy ended up on the call,\" Trump said in an interview with Newsmax.",
      "But during an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham Tuesday night, Waltz contradicted Trump's statement, saying he was the one who accidentally invited Goldberg to the chat.",
      "\u201cWell, look, a staffer wasn't responsible. And look, I take full responsibility. I built the group,\" Waltz said, adding that the incident was \"embarrassing.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Gabbard told the House Intelligence Committee that it was \"a mistake\" to add Goldberg to the chat.",
      "During a news conference in Kingston, Jamaica, on Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that he, too, was on the Signal chat and added, \"Someone made a big mistake and added a journalist.\"",
      "Elon Musk and his team at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are reviewing how Goldberg was added to a Signal chat, a senior White House official told ABC News.",
      "In his interview with Fox News Tuesday night, Waltz alluded to Musk's involvement, saying, \"I just talked to Elon on the way here -- we have the best technical minds looking at how this happened.\"",
      "The White House official confirmed to ABC News that DOGE is involved and that the team is working with other teams to make communications \"more secure and efficient.\"",
      "Leavitt said on FOX News that in addition to Musk and his team, the National Security Council \"is all digging into this matter... to ensure this could never happen again.\"",
      "Asked by Sen. Warner during Tuesday's Senate Intelligence Committee hearing whether the FBI was investigating the matter, FBI Director Kash Patel, who was not part of the chat, said, \"Senator, I was just briefed about it late last night and this morning. I don't have an update.\"",

      "HOUSTON -- The woman convicted of killing Tejano music legend Selena Quintanilla-Perez has been denied parole after spending decades behind bars for fatally shooting the young singer at a Texas motel in 1995, the state\u2019s parole board announced Thursday.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar is serving a life sentence at the Patrick L. O\u2019Daniel prison unit in Gatesville, Texas. A three-member panel of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted to not release her. The panel said her case will be eligible to be reviewed again for parole in 2030.",
      "The singer known to her fans as simply Selena was one of the first Mexican-Americans to make it into the mainstream music scene and was on the verge of crossing over into the English-language pop market when she was killed.",
      "Sald\u00edvar founded Selena\u2019s fan club and had been the manager of the singer\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., until she was fired in early March 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "Selena a Corpus Christi native, was 23 years old when she was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi on March 31, 1995. She was able to run to the motel lobby where she collapsed, and she was pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified that Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a nine-hour standoff with police. She told police she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is on a global egg hunt",
      "SCHOENEICHE, Germany -- The U.S. government is on a global egg hunt, seeking exports from countries in Europe and elsewhere to ease a severe shortage that has caused egg prices at grocery stores to hit record highs.",
      "Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden are among the nations the U.S. Department of Agriculture approached to address the shortage brought on by a bird flu outbreak, according to European industry groups.",
      "But supplying Americans with eggs would be complicated for foreign producers \u2014 and not because of political tensions over the myriad import tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed or threatened to impose on his nation's top trading partners.",
      "Even if they were eager to share, European countries don\u2019t have many surplus eggs because of their own avian flu outbreaks and the growing domestic demand ahead of Easter.",
      "One of the biggest obstacles, however, is the approach the United States takes to preventing salmonella contamination. U.S. food safety regulations require fresh eggs to be sanitized and refrigerated before they reach shoppers; in the European Union, safety standards call for Grade A eggs to be sold unwashed and without extended chilling.",
      "\u201cThese are two systems that could not be more different,\u201d said Hans-Peter Goldnick, the president of the German Egg Association.",
      "It is common in parts of Europe, for example, for consumers to buy eggs that still have feathers and chicken poop stuck to them.",
      "Farmer David Karlsch described the simple process that gets eggs from hens to customers of the family-owned Saballus poultry farm in Schoeneiche, a town just outside Germany\u2019s capital: The eggs are taken from nests, placed into cartons and sold on the premises or from a refrigerated vending machine just outside the property.",
      "\u201cThe demand at Easter time is of course very, very high, as many children naturally want to paint eggs,\u201d Karlsch said.",
      "Poland, a major egg exporter, fielded a U.S. query about the availability of eggs, according to Katarzyna Gawro\u0144ska, director of the National Chamber of Poultry and Feed Producers. The issue of washed vs. unwashed was a major factor as European officials considered such requests, she said.",
      "Eggs are not cleaned in most of the 27 EU member nations because of concerns that removing the natural protective coating from eggshells makes them more vulnerable to bacteria, Gawro\u0144ska said.",
      "Polish veterinary officials are trying to determine if the country and its farmers can meet U.S. requirements, such as whether the exporting country has a comparable food safety inspection system or a significant bird flu outbreak.",
      "Although European Union regulations state that table eggs \u201cshall not be washed or cleaned,\u201d member countries have some leeway if they authorized egg baths at packing plants decades ago.",
      "Danish Egg Association CEO J\u00f8rgen Nyberg Larsen said national customs are part of it; washed eggs are the norm in Sweden, for example. But Sweden and Norway have informed the U.S. they don't have extra eggs to export, Larsen said.",
      "For now, any increased U.S. egg imports from Europe are more likely to arrive in powdered form or other products that can be shipped frozen or dried, Larsen said.",
      "That's the response Poland's trade association gave U.S. officials. If the U.S. certifies Poland as a source, the organization's members would have a limited number of shell eggs to sell but could supply \u201cvery large volumes of egg processing products,\u201d Gawro\u0144ska said.",
      "Processed eggs usually are pasteurized to prevent foodborne illnesses and then used in food manufacturing or by restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Baked goods, pasta and sauces like mayonnaise are some of the commercial products made with egg powder.",
      "U.S. officials also tried to sound out farmers in northern Italy's Veneto region for emergency egg supplies, according to Coldiretti, the main Italian agricultural lobbying organization.",
      "But Italy only produces enough eggs to cover the national demand so most of the region's producers said they could not help. Bird flu outbreaks since the start of last year also have taken a toll on the Italian poultry industry.",
      "Germany cannot contribute much either. Its domestic poultry industry generates about 73% of the eggs consumed in the country, \u201cand we ourselves essentially have to import eggs from Holland every day to keep everyone satisfied,\" the German Egg Association\u2019s Goldnick said.",
      "\u201cWe have around 45 million eggs that we can collect from the chicken coops every day, and in America, there\u2019s a shortage of around 50 million eggs a day. That shows how difficult it is,\u201d he said.",
      "Other countries the U.S. government contacted include Austria, Norway, Spain and Denmark. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it secured new egg commitments from Turkey and South Korea in recent months, although it did not specify the amount or type.",
      "Imports of liquid, frozen and dried eggs may help free up some domestic shell eggs for consumers, but the U.S. made its appeal for foreign eggs amid a significant deficit; last month, the country produced 720 million fewer table eggs than in February 2024, a decline of nearly 10%.",
      "The U.S. also cut its own egg exports to boost supplies at home, the Agriculture Department said.",
      "While the informal trade talks continue, the U.S. market has shown signs of improvement. It\u2019s been nearly a month since a major bird flu outbreak impacted egg-laying hens, the department said. It reported the national wholesale price for large eggs dropped to $3.27 per dozen as of March 21, or less than half its peak of $8.15 per dozen on Feb. 21.",
      "U.S. consumers are just starting to see those falling wholesale prices translate to lower prices on grocery shelves, the department said. The big demand for eggs that usually accompanies Easter and Passover could cause prices to edge up again next month.",
      "Trump hasn't exactly walked on eggshells with the people of Europe since starting his second term. The president's repeated threats to seize Greenland, a Danish territory, infuriated many in Denmark. His posture toward Ukraine and disparaging remarks from top members of his administration have alarmed America's European allies.",
      "The European Union, which is the third-largest trade partner of the U.S., was not exempted from the tariffs Trump ordered on steel, aluminum and automobiles. Bracing for more, it has prepared counter-tariffs on American products.",
      "But many officials in Europe say none of that would rule out exporting eggs.",
      "Goldnick said an egg producer friend recently told him that \u201cif the price is right, then I\u2019ll deliver.\u201d Any deals made or not would come down to business decisions, he said.",
      "\u201cI have two souls in my chest. On the one hand, I would say, 'No, we can\u2019t support this system,' but that\u2019s not the right answer,\" he said, referring to the new U.S. tariffs on European goods.",
      "\u201cThe right answer is we have to help where we can. And it concerns the people. It doesn\u2019t concern the government. You wouldn\u2019t prop them up or anything, but it\u2019s just people\u2019s demand at Easter, for eggs, and that\u2019s just as important to satisfy in America as it is here.\u201d",

      "The man believed to be the oldest surviving World War II paratrooper has died",
      "Sgt. Joe Harris, believed to be the oldest surviving World War II paratrooper and a member of the U.S. Army\u2019s first all-Black parachute infantry battalion, has died. He was 108.",
      "Harris died March 15 in a hospital in Los Angeles surrounded by family, grandson Ashton Pittman told The Associated Press. He will be honored with a full military funeral on April 5.",
      "\u201cHe was a very loving, loving, loving man,\u201d said Pittman. \u201cThat was one of the things that he was very strict upon was loving one another.\u201d",
      "Harris was among the last surviving members of the historic 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, nicknamed the Triple Nickles. The battalion helped protect the U.S. from deadly Japanese balloon bombs, according to Robert L. Bartlett, a retired Eastern Washington University professor who specializes in the 555th. In 1944 and 1945, the Japanese launched thousands of the balloons to be carried by the Pacific jet stream to the U.S. mainland to explode and start fires.",
      "During World War II, Black Americans were often relegated to more support-level jobs in the racially segregated military and President Franklin Roosevelt faced pressure to put them in combat units. As a result, the military recruited Harris and hundreds of other Black men, trained them and sent them into blazes on the West Coast, where they fought fires, Bartlett said.",
      "Throughout their time in the military, they faced overt racism, including being barred from going to the base commissary and officer\u2019s clubs unless they were specifically for Black people.",
      "\u201cThis unit had to fight to be recognized as human beings while training to fight an enemy overseas, fight in their own country for respect even within the military,\u201d Bartlett said.",
      "That was not lost on Pittman, who said his grandfather was brave enough to serve the U.S. \u201cduring a time when the country didn\u2019t love him, honestly, didn\u2019t care about him.\u201d",
      "Harris was born on June 19, 1916, in West Dale, Louisiana, according to Tracie Hunter, spokesperson for WWII Beyond The Call, a nonprofit organization that works to document veterans' accounts. After filling out his draft registration card, he began his military service in 1941 when he was 24.",
      "By the time he was honorably discharged in November 1945, he had completed 72 parachute jumps, according to Hunter.",
      "After the war, he worked for the U.S. Border Patrol. He also spent more than 60 years in Compton, California, where Pittman said he was the neighborhood patriarch, a man everyone on the block knew and gravitated to.",
      "\u201cHis life is to be celebrated,\u201d Pittman said. \u201cObviously people are going to morn because he\u2019s not here anymore. But ultimately what I know from conversations that I\u2019ve had with my grandfather is that he wants to be celebrated. He deserves to be celebrated.\u201d",
      "He is survived by his son, Pirate Joe Harris Sr., and two daughters, Michaun Harris and Latanya Pittman, along with five grandchildren, according to Hunter. His wife, Louise Harris, died in 1981, and a sixth grandchild has also died.",
      "Pittman said that his grandfather would sometimes ask him if he would ever jump out of a plane. In October, Pittman had the opportunity to follow in his grandfather\u2019s airborne footsteps.",
      "For a week, he did paratrooper jump training in Corsicana, Texas, through the Liberty Jump Team, an organization that works to preserve the memory of veterans.",
      "\u201cWhen I got my wings, I actually broke down and started crying because everything in that moment just resonated with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like, dang I\u2019m literally doing what my grandfather did.\u201d",
      "Shortly before Harris' death, he got a landing zone, in Tuskegee, Alabama, dedicated in his name. Pittman said he plans to be the very first person to jump in the Sgt. Joe Harris Dropzone.",

    "story": [
      "Georgia lawmakers are giving up on creating a statewide database to collect information on students who might commit violence",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia lawmakers are giving up on creating a statewide database to collect information on students who might commit violence, even as they push forward other parts of a school safety bill aimed at preventing a school shooting like the one in September at Apalachee High School.",
      "House and Senate lawmakers unveiled a compromise version of House Bill 268 on Thursday, which then passed the Senate Judiciary committee unanimously. That sets it up for final passage in the closing days of Georgia's 2025 legislative session.",
      "The push to share information was driven by the belief among many that the Barrow County school system didn\u2019t have a full picture of the warning signs displayed by the 14-year-old accused in the fatal shootings of two students and two teachers. But there was loud opposition from both Democratic and Republican constituencies that the database would create a permanent blacklist with no due process that could treat racial and religious minorities unfairly.",
      "\u201cThe reason it wasn\u2019t going to fly was pushback from all points of the political spectrum that worried about their child being stigmatized just for an accusation or an uncorroborated complaint,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cowsert, an Athens Republican representing parts of Barrow County.",
      "The compromise version also removed a requirement that all school systems set up formal threat management teams to evaluate whether students may commit violence. That approach is strongly recommended by many national experts, and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency already offers training. House Education Committee Chairman Chris Erwin, a Republican from Homer, said he was hopeful schools would voluntarily adopt the model.",
      "\u201cI think there is a knowledge out there of the importance of planning and preparing already in schools,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cSo having a full model structure for the state isn\u2019t as important as maybe we once thought it was.\u201d",
      "The measure would still require police agencies to report to schools when officers learn that a child has threatened death or injury to someone at a school. But those reports aren't mandated to become part of a student's educational record and wouldn't travel with a student if they transfer to another district.",
      "That raises questions about whether the bill addresses one of the key criticisms that followed the Apalachee shooting. School officials never became aware that a sheriff's deputy in Jackson County had interviewed Colt Gray in May 2023 after the FBI passed along a tip that Gray might have posted a shooting threat online. That report would have been forwarded to middle school officials in Jackson County under the bill, but wouldn't have followed Gray when he enrolled as a freshman in nearby Barrow County after skipping eighth grade entirely.",
      "The bill also mandates quicker transfers of records when a student enters a new school, creates at least one new position to help coordinate mental health treatment for students in each of Georgia\u2019s 180 school districts and sets up an anonymous reporting system statewide.",
      "Lawmakers on Thursday added in features of separate Senate bills that had passed. They would mandate that all Georgia public schools provide wearable panic buttons to employees. Public schools would also be required to submit electronic maps of their campuses to local, state and federal agencies once a year.",
      "The amended bill would also make adult prosecution the default when children aged 13 to 16 are charged with terroristic acts at school, any aggravated assault with a gun, or attempted murder. The Senate had originally proposed a broader range of crimes when adult prosecution would be the default. House leaders had said they didn't want to submit any more juveniles to adult prosecution.",

    "story": [
      "The centuries-old city of St. Augustine is an enduring reminder of Spain\u2019s long history in Florida, going back generations before the United States even existed",
      "The city of St. Augustine \u2014 with its centuries-old buildings and massive stone fort \u2014 is an enduring reminder of Spain\u2019s storied history in Florida, going back generations before the United States even existed. But for two decades in the 1700s, Great Britain controlled the region, and archeologists have finally found some of their long-sought-after footprints.",
      "City archeologists identified a dry moat last fall of a British redoubt, a fortified military outpost, that had been constructed in 1781. Excavations were completed last month in the city's Lincolnville neighborhood, making way for the construction of a new single-family home.",
      "\u201cSt. Augustine had a 20-year British period,\u201d city archeologist Andrea White said. \u201cThey came, and they built seven of these redoubts, and nobody has ever found any archeologically. We have rough ideas of where they were, and they show up on historic maps. But we\u2019ve never found actual, tangible, archeological evidence for any of them until recently.\u201d",
      "The Spanish military built the Castillo de San Marcos in the late 1600s, and the fort remains on the western shore of Florida's Matanzas Bay, though as a national monument rather than a military installation.",
      "When the British took control of Florida in 1763, St. Augustine already had extensive Spanish-built defenses, but British officers were concerned about an attack from a nearby river and ordered the construction of the outposts along the city's western edge.",
      "White said Britain's relatively brief occupation of St. Augustine, which ended along with the American Revolution in 1783, has been largely forgotten by time, and the discovery of the fort is a way to reclaim a little piece of lost history.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about these British redoubts, they\u2019re the only defenses that the British built themselves,\u201d White said. \u201cEverything else that\u2019s in St. Augustine or the surrounding area that everyone\u2019s familiar with, those were already built by the Spanish. And then the British just kind of reoccupied them.\u201d",
      "The structure was discovered thanks to a unique archeological preservation ordinance adopted by St. Augustine in 1986, White said. Founded in 1565, the city is the oldest continuously occupied part of the U.S. to previously be a European settlement. To document and preserve that history, St. Augustine has its own archeology program that is part of the city's planning and permitting department.",
      "\u201cWe get a chance to come in and document what\u2019s there prior to construction,\u201d White said. \u201cWe never stop construction, that\u2019s not the goal. It\u2019s just to give us a little bit of time to come in, document what might be there, learn a little bit more about our history, and then the project gets to move forward.\u201d",
      "White knew the area under development had a long history, going back to a Native American mission in the early 1700s, followed later by an agricultural plantation and after the Civil War, the construction of the Lincolnville neighborhood.",
      "\u201cSo we knew we had multiple centuries of history that could potentially be on the property, but we\u2019re pretty excited to actually find evidence,\u201d White said. \u201cWhat we found evidence of was a large moat about 15 feet wide that would have been part of the rampart.\u201d",
      "Researchers found few artifacts at the site and are still unsure about the fort's actual size and shape, but they did recover thousands of different types of seeds. White said they\u2019re working with a paleoethnobotanist, who studies the history of how humans and plants interact, to learn how the structure was built and used. It\u2019s possible that plants like Spanish bayonet or prickly pear cactuses were used to prevent erosion or to slow down attacking soldiers.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re very hopeful that we might find some good information from our plant remains that we\u2019ve recovered,\u201d White said.",
      "Jason Heidgerken, the contractor working on the lot where the fort's moat was found, said the city's archeological program can certainly cause delays, but White and her team were great and communicating well, so he could adjust his timelines.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been around St. Augustine since 1980 personally, and part of the attraction is the history,\u201d Heidgerken said. \u201cSo if you want to live there and do this kind of business, it\u2019s to be expected, and you need to have the patience for it.\u201d",
      "Over the past four decades, the city's archeology program has completed more than 1,200 projects. Not only have researchers collected data from Spanish colonial times but also Native American settlements and villages going back 4,000 years.",
      "\u201cI actually think it\u2019s pretty cool what the city does. I\u2019m a history nut myself,\u201d Heidgerken said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty neat.\u201d",

      "CHICAGO -- A federal judge has temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Labor from implementing parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders aimed at curbing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts among federal contractors and grant recipients.",
      "Judge Matthew Kennelly of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois halted the Labor Department from requiring federal contractors or grant recipients from certifying that they don't operate any programs in violation of Trump's anti-DEI executive orders.",
      "That certification provision has stepped up pressure on companies and other organizations to revisit their DEI practices because if the government were to determine they violated the provision, they would be subject to crippling financial penalties under the False Claims Act.",
      "Thursday's ruling is in response to a lawsuit filed by Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit founded in 1981 that helps prepare women for work in skilled construction trades and has several contracts with the Department of Labor. There was no immediate reaction from Chicago Women in Trades to Kennelly's order. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "A hearing on Chicago Women in Trades' bid for a longer-lasting halt on Trump's anti-DEI executive orders is scheduled for April 10.",
      "The organization's lawsuit is one of several challenging Trump's executive orders targeting DEI programs in both the private and public sectors.",
      "Trump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all \u201cequity-related\u201d grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order that included a requirement that federal contractors and grantees certify that they don't \u201coperate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.\u201d",
      "Kennelly\u2019s decision comes nearly two weeks after an appeals court lifted a broader nationwide injunction against Trump\u2019s anti-DEI executive orders in a separate lawsuit in Baltimore. But Thursday\u2019s ruling is limited in scope because Kennelly declined to extend the temporary restraining order to other federal agencies.",
      "Chicago Women in Trades, which filed its case against the Trump administration last month, argued that the president's executive orders on DEI are so broad and vague that the organization had no way to ensure compliance, and thus they threaten its core mission.",
      "Kennelly wrote that Chicago Women in Trades, which is being represented by the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was likely to succeed in its arguments that parts of the executive orders are a violation of free speech rights and are unconstitutionally vague.",
      "Although the government argued that the certification provision \u201cimplicates only illegal DEI programs, it has studiously declined to shed any light on what this means. The answer is anything but obvious,\u201d Kennelly wrote.",
      "Kennelly wrote that he extended his order to all Labor Department contractors and grant recipients because the vagueness of Trump's executive orders, coupled with the threat of financial penalties, would likely pressure organizations to curb DEI programs in potential violation of free speech rights.",
      "Rather than face potentially crippling penalties, \u201cit is likely that many of these grantees will take the safer route and choose to simply stop speaking on anything remotely related to what the government might consider to promote DEI or equity. A nationwide restraining order is appropriate to protect grantees who cannot afford the risks inherent in biting the hand that feeds them,\" Kennelly wrote.",
      "The judge also blocked the DOL from freezing or canceling any funding with Chicago Women in Trades, and the Trump administration from pursuing any False Claims Act enforcement against them.",
      "During a hearing on Tuesday, the Trump administration argued that Chicago Women in Trades' motion for relief was premature because its arguments rely on speculation as to how the executive orders will be implemented.",
      "But Chicago Women in Trades noted in court filings that it has multiple communications from the Department of Labor directing them to ensure compliance with both DEI executive orders. The organization also said in court and has already lost a subcontract with a contractor trying to comply with the executive order.",
      "Chicago Women in Trades has a long history of partnering with companies, state and federal agencies and other industry stakeholders to provide guidance and training on best practices for recruiting and retaining women in the trades \u2014 including training to combat bias and harassment that is prevalent in one of the country\u2019s most male-dominated industries.",
      "Its grant work with the federal government dates back years, including two grants awarded under the first Trump administration under the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations, which aims to expand pathways for women seeking to enter skilled trades.",

      "The family of a 69-year-old man who died in a rural Colorado jail in 2023 says he slowly suffocated to death after his ribs were broken during an altercation with a deputy and he languished in a cell for a week without medical care",
      "DENVER -- A 69-year-old man slowly suffocated to death in a rural Colorado jail after his ribs were broken during an altercation with a deputy and he languished in a cell for a week without medical care, according to a lawsuit announced by the man\u2019s family Thursday.",
      "The 2023 death of Michael Burch was ruled a homicide. Following a state investigation, prosecutors decided not to bring criminal charges against the deputy who used a Taser on Burch and wrestled with him in a Huerfano County jail cell. District Attorney Henry Solano noted there was \u201csufficient information\u201d that the deputy could say he acted in self-defense.",
      "An autopsy report found six of Burch\u2019s right ribs had broken and his right lung collapsed after the altercation with the deputy. He wasn\u2019t taken to a hospital but instead was transferred to another cell where he was found dead seven days later.",
      "\u201cThe simple act of breathing became so painful as Mr. Burch\u2019s shattered ribs continued to pierce and tear through his organs that his body stopped using his right lung, which shrank to half the normal size,\u201d lawyers for Burch's estate said in the federal lawsuit.",
      "It named as defendants the Huerfano County commissioners, sheriff\u2019s office, individual sheriff\u2019s officials, paramedics and the hospital they worked for as well as nurses and the nonprofit company contracted to provide health care to jail inmates.",
      "The lawsuit accuses them of causing Burch\u2019s fatal injuries and not doing anything to treat them, violating his constitutional rights.",
      "A lawyer representing the county and sheriff's office, Eric Ziporin, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Spanish Peaks Regional Health Center, Stacy Cristelli, said the hospital could not comment because of patient privacy but would defend itself in court.",
      "Lawyers for Burch\u2019s family from the firm Rathod Mohamedbhai said they were not aware of anyone being disciplined or fired in connection with Burch's death.",
      "Burch was tackled after he refused to drop a pencil he had been given to take notes in the cell. A deputy had warned him \u201cDrop it or we\u2019ll drop you\u201d, according to body camera footage. Once the Taser was used, Burch began to charge at the deputy and the video, which becomes obscured, shows him going to the ground near a steel bench in the cell and his arms being held by the deputy. The lawsuit says Burch was tackled into the bench, which it says broke his ribs.",
      "Burch, a former California prison guard, was arrested on March 25, 2023, after a series of erratic acts, including driving up to the home of two strangers and swinging a rubber mallet around, that the lawsuit claims was caused by his deteriorating mental health.",
      "Burch's mental health was not evaluated when he arrived at the jail, the lawsuit claims, although video captured another sheriff's official signaling he was crazy by stirring her finger next to her head after he was hit with the Taser and tackled on March 28, 2023.",
      "The inmate screamed and moaned as the deputy then used a knee to keep Burch on the ground when he was accused of resisting. Later he appeared calmer when he was evaluated by paramedics. He told them that his ribs had been crushed and said he wanted to go to the hospital but the paramedics did not evaluate his chest, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Body camera footage shows one paramedic saying he was going to check out his right side but it was not clear from the footage what he did.",
      "Burch was not taken to the hospital, the lawsuit said, but moved to a neighboring cell, where the blurry window in the door was temporarily covered by plastic that said \u201cwarning security and safety zone\u201d, which was also captured on video.",
      "After Burch told a sheriff's captain that he barely survived the night on April 1, 2023, he was seen over video by a contracted nurse in Mississippi but she did not ask to see Burch's chest, the lawsuit said, instead focusing her attention on his mental health.",
      "Three days later, Burch was found dead on the concrete floor of his cell.",

      "There will almost certainly be questions about the 85 dangerous close calls between planes and helicopters near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport that the NTSB identified in the three years before the crash and why officials didn't do something about them. Lawmakers on the Commerce Committee that oversees aviation have also questioned why the Army routinely operated helicopters through the area with a key safety system that is supposed to notify other aircraft and the tower about their location turned off.",
      "Both of the top ranking members of the committee \u2014 Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell \u2014 have sent letters demanding answers from the Army about how often and why their Black Hawks have operated in around Washington D.C. without transmitting location data.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said earlier this month that the close proximity of planes and helicopters in Washington, D.C., represented an \u201cintolerable risk to aviation safety\u201d that the FAA should have spotted sooner.",
      "Homendy said Wednesday that the FAA needs to do more to analyze the safety data it posses. \u201cThe next accident is in the data right now. And what are we doing to figure out what that is?\u201d she said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy promised to use artificial intelligence to review data from other airports to identify any similar risks elsewhere \u2014 particularly in eight metro areas with busy helicopter routes: Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles.",
      "Investigators are still in the early stages of determining why the American Airlines passenger jet and Army helicopter collided as the plane prepared to land Jan. 29. Both plunged into the Potomac River, killing everyone aboard. It will likely take more than a year to complete the final report.",
      "Investigators previously said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers.",
      "The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.",
      "A string of crashes this year along with a near miss have brought attention to air travel, which remains overwhelmingly safe. On Jan. 31 a medical transport jet crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven. On Feb. 6 a small commuter aircraft went down off western Alaska, killing 10. On Feb. 17, a Delta plane crashed and flipped over upon landing in Toronto. Two small planes collided in midair in Arizona on Feb. 19, killing two people. And there was a scary moment Feb. 25 in Chicago when a Southwest Airlines plane came within 200 feet of crashing into another plane crossing the runway before it aborted its landing to avoid it.",
      "Here's a look at the Jan. 29 crash in Washington:",
      "American Airlines Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kansas, was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members as it approached to land on a clear night. Nearby, the Army Black Hawk, with three soldiers on board, was practicing emergency evacuation routes that would be used to ferry out key government officials in an attack or catastrophe.",
      "Investigators said they believe the helicopter crew was wearing night-vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision.",
      "A few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane turned to adjust its approach. The NTSB now says that any time that runway is used \u2014 the one in question accounts for about 5% of the airport's flights \u2014 the helicopter route should be shut down.",
      "Shortly before the collision, a controller got an alert saying the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the jet in sight. The military pilot said yes and asked for \u201cvisual separation\u201d with the jet for a second time, allowing it to fly closer than if the pilots couldn't see the plane. Controllers approved the request.",
      "Roughly 20 seconds later, the aircraft collided.",
      "The NTSB has recovered all flight data recorders and pulled the wreckage of both aircraft from the Potomac.",
      "Homendy told reporters last month that the Black Hawk's cockpit recorder suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew unable to hear air traffic control tell them, just before the crash, to move behind the jet.",
      "\u201cThat transmission was interrupted \u2014 it was stepped on,\u201d she said at a Feb. 14 briefing, leaving the helicopter\u2019s crew unable to hear the words \u201cpass behind the\u201d because their microphone key was pressed.",
      "The radio altitude of the helicopter was 278 feet (85 meters) at the time, which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for that location.",
      "Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicate that the crew may not have had accurate altitude readings, with the helicopter\u2019s pilot calling out that they were at 300 feet (91 meters) but the instructor pilot saying 400 feet (122 meters), Homendy said.",
      "\u201cWe are looking at the possibility there may be bad data,\u201d she said.",
      "That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters: one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter\u2019s black box captures its radio altitude.",
      "Almost immediately after the crash, President Donald Trump faulted the helicopter for flying too high. He also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. When pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, he blamed an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system that he said should have been replaced years ago.",
      "The Black Hawk crew was made up of an instructor pilot with 968 hours of flight experience, a pilot with about 450 hours and a crew chief with nearly 1,150 hours. Army officials have said the crew was familiar with the crowded skies around Washington.",
      "The Army identified the Black Hawk crew as Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, 28, of Durham, North Carolina; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. O\u2019Hara was the crew chief, and Eaves and Lobach were pilots.",
      "Among the jet\u2019s passengers were several members of the Skating Club of Boston who were returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. A figure skating tribute event in Washington raised $1.2 million for the crash victims' families.",
      "Others included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas: four members of a steamfitters\u2019 union in suburban Maryland: nine students and parents from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia: and two Chinese nationals.",

      "FBI Director Kash Patel may not have been part of a Signal chat in which other Trump administration national security officials discussed detailed attack plans",
      "WASHINGTON -- FBI Director Kash Patel was not part of a Signal chat in which other Trump administration national security officials discussed detailed attack plans, but that didn't spare him from being questioned by lawmakers this week about whether the nation's premier law enforcement agency would investigate.",
      "Patel made no such commitments during the course of two days of Senate and House hearings. Instead, he testified that he had not personally reviewed the text messages that were inadvertently shared with the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic who was mistakenly included on an unclassified Signal chat.",
      "That Patel would be grilled on what the FBI might do was hardly surprising.",
      "Even as President Donald Trump insisted \"it's not really an FBI thing,\u201d the reality is that the FBI and Justice Department for decades have been responsible for enforcing Espionage Act statutes governing the mishandling \u2014 whether intentional or negligent \u2014 of national defense information like the kind shared on Signal, a publicly available app that provides encrypted communications but is not approved for classified information.",
      "The Justice Department has broad discretion to open an investigation, though it remains unclear whether Attorney General Pam Bondi, who introduced Trump at a Justice Department event this month, would authorize such an inquiry. Trump administration officials insist that the details shared were not classified, though the Espionage Act technically criminalizes the mishandling of any information deemed to be closely held national defense information even if not classified.",
      "Multiple high-profile figures have found themselves under investigation in recent years over their handling of government secrets, but the differences in the underlying facts and the outcomes make it impossible to prognosticate what might happen in this instance or whether any accountability can be expected. There's also precedent for public officials either to avoid criminal charges or be spared meaningful punishment.",
      "\u201cIn terms of prior investigations, there were set-out standards that the department always looked at and tried to follow when making determinations about which types of disclosures they were going to pursue,\u201d said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Zweiback, who has handled classified information investigations.",
      "Those factors include the sensitivity of the information exposed and the willfulness of the conduct.",
      "A look at just a few of the notable prior investigations:",
      "The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was investigated but not charged for her use of a private email server for the sake of convenience during her time as secretary of state in the Obama administration. There appear to be some parallels with the Signal chat episode.",
      "The politically fraught criminal investigation was initiated by a 2015 referral from the intelligence agencies\u2019 internal watchdog, which alerted the FBI to the presence of potentially hundreds of emails containing classified information on that server. Law enforcement then set out to determine whether Clinton, or her aides, had transmitted classified information on a server not meant to host such material.",
      "The overall conclusions were something of a mixed bag.",
      "Then-FBI Director James Comey, in a highly unusual public statement, asserted that the bureau had found evidence that Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information but recommended against charges because he said officials could not prove that she intended to break the law or knew that the information she and her aides were communicating about was classified.",
      "The decision was derided by Republicans who thought the Obama administration Justice Department had let a fellow Democrat off the hook. Among those critical were some of the very same participants in the Signal chat as well as Bondi, who as Florida's attorney general spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention and mimicked the audience chant of \u201cLock her up!\u201d",
      "Among the biggest names to actually get charged is Petraeus, the former CIA director sentenced in 2015 to two years' probation for disclosing classified information to a biographer with whom he was having an extramarital affair.",
      "That material consisted of eight binders of classified information that Petraeus improperly kept in his house from his time as the top military commander in Afghanistan. Among the secret details in the \u201cblack books\u201d were the names of covert operatives, the coalition war strategy and notes about Petraeus\u2019 discussions with President Barack Obama and the National Security Council, prosecutors have said.",
      "Petraeus, a retired four-star Army general who led U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, wound up pleading guilty to a single misdemeanor count of unauthorized retention and removal of classified material as part of a deal with Justice Department prosecutors. Some national security experts said it smacked of a double-standard for its lenient outcome.",
      "Comey himself would later complain about the resolution, writing in a 2018 book that he argued to the Justice Department that Petraeus should have also been charged with a felony for lying to the FBI.",
      "\u201cA poor person, an unknown person \u2014 say a young black Baptist minister from Richmond \u2014 would be charged with a felony and sent to jail,\u201d he said.",
      "A former CIA officer, Sterling was convicted of leaking to a reporter details of a secret mission to thwart Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions by slipping flawed nuclear blueprints to the Iranians through a Russian intermediary.",
      "He was sentenced in 2015 to 3 1/2 years in prison, a punishment whistleblower advocates and other supporters decried as impossible to square with Petraeus' misdemeanor guilty plea just a month earlier.",
      "The details of the operation disclosed by Sterling were published by journalist James Risen in his 2006 book \u201cState of War.\u201d",
      "Sterling was charged in 2010, but the trial was delayed for years, in part because of legal wrangling about whether Risen could be forced to testify. Ultimately, prosecutors chose not to call Risen as a witness, despite winning legal battles allowing them to do so.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vetoed a Republican-authored bill Friday that would have required state education officials to score standardized student tests according to the scale they used years ago.",
      "State schools Superintendent Jill Underly, a liberal who faces conservative Brittany Kinser in Tuesday's spring election, changed student standardized testing benchmarks and scoring thresholds for school district performance report cards last year. She has said that she made the performance changes at the request of Wisconsin teachers and how they felt their students can perform.",
      "Republicans argue the changes watered down standards in an effort to artificially inflate performance grades and made it harder to compare Wisconsin students and districts to their peers around the rest of the country. Evers has said Underly made a mistake because she didn't cerate a public dialogue about the changes before she imposed them, but online legislative records indicate he vetoed the bill on Friday morning.",
      "The governor said in his veto message that while he's been critical of the process, he objects to legislators trying to undermine the state superintendent's authority and independence. Evers served as state schools superintendent before he became governor in 2019.",
      "The measure would have required education officials to apply performance levels established by the National Assessment of Educational Process when rating the Wisconsin Forward exam, a standardized English and math test.",
      "They also would have had to use terms from the 2021-22 school year to rate student performance on two other standardized tests, the PreACT and ACT with Writing in English, Reading and Mathematics.

      "WASHINGTON -- A judge challenging the outcome of his North Carolina Supreme Court race was photographed wearing Confederate military garb and posing before a Confederate battle flag when he was a member of a college fraternity that glorified the pre-Civil War South.",
      "The emergence of the photographs comes at a delicate time for Jefferson Griffin, a Republican appellate judge who is seeking a spot on North Carolina's highest court. Griffin, 44, is facing mounting criticism \u2013 including from some Republicans \u2013 as he seeks to invalidate over 60,000 votes cast in last November\u2019s election, a still undecided contest in which he is trailing the Democratic incumbent by over 700 votes.",
      "The photographs, which were obtained by The Associated Press, are from when Griffin was a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1999-2003 and a member of the Kappa Alpha Order, one of the oldest and largest fraternities in the U.S., with tens of thousands of alumni.",
      "Griffin said he regretted donning the Confederate uniform, which was customary during the fraternity's annual \u201cOld South\u201d ball.",
      "\u201cI attended a college fraternity event that, in hindsight, was inappropriate and does not reflect the person I am today,\u201d Griffin said in a statement. \u201cAt that time, like many college students, I did not fully grasp such participation\u2019s broader historical and social implications. Since then, I have grown, learned, and dedicated myself to values that promote unity, inclusivity, and respect for all people.\u201d",
      "One of the pictures, taken during the 2001 ball, shows Griffin and roughly two-dozen other fraternity members clad in Confederate uniforms. Another photograph from the spring of 2000 shows Griffin and other Kappa Alpha brothers in front of a large Confederate flag. He served in 2002 as his chapter\u2019s president.",
      "Kappa Alpha has proven to be a lightning rod for controversy over the decades, often due to the racist or insensitive actions of some of its members. A number of politicians have been forced to apologize for having worn Confederate costumes at the fraternity's functions or for being photographed in front of a Confederate flag.",
      "Jesse Lyons, a spokesman for the fraternity's national office in Lexington, Virginia, said use of the rebel battle flag was prohibited in 2001 and displaying other Confederate symbols had been discouraged years before. The fraternity banned the wearing of the Confederate uniforms in 2010. It's unclear if the chapter at UNC banned the uniforms before the national organization did.",
      "\u201cWe believe in cultural humility, we respect the best parts of our organization\u2019s history, and through education we challenge our members to work for a better future. These things are not mutually exclusive,\u201d Lyons said.",
      "The fraternity claims Robert E. Lee as its \u201cspiritual founder\u201d and long championed the Southern \u201cLost Cause,\" a revisionist view of history that romanticizes the Confederacy and portrays the Civil War as a valiant struggle for \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d unrelated to the enslavement of Black people. In decades past, some Kappa Alpha chapters referred to themselves as a \u201cklan,\u201d a term that many viewed as an unsubtle wink to the Ku Klux Klan.",
      "The photographs featuring Griffin were taken at a time when many other Kappa Alpha chapters were reevaluating their celebration of the Confederacy.",
      "During Griffin\u2019s time in the fraternity, some in his chapter questioned the appropriateness of dressing up in Confederate uniforms for the ball. Griffin opposed abandoning the tradition, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. The uniforms stayed.",
      "Griffin said he would \u201cnot respond to unsubstantiated comments based on memories of 20-plus years past.\u201d",
      "In high school Griffin also expressed an affinity for Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who led southern forces during the Civil War. In a 1998 feature on high school \u201cscholars of the week\u201d in the Raleigh News & Observer newspaper, Griffin said Lee was his No. 1 choice to include on an \u201cideal guest list\u201d for a party.",
      "The Kappa Alpha Order was founded in 1865, not long after Lee surrendered to the Union Army, at a Virginia college where Lee served as president. At least one of the first members was a former rebel soldier who had served under Lee, who is revered by the fraternity as the ideal of gentlemanly Southern chivalry.",
      "For more than a century, Kappa Alpha threw \u201cOld South\u201d parties. They were formal affairs where the Confederate battle flag was flown and fraternity brothers dressed in replica Confederate gray uniforms and their dates wore antebellum-style hoop skirts. Sometimes they would ride through campus on horseback.",
      "Some Kappa Alpha chapters, particularly in the South, clung to their traditions, including the wearing of blackface, even as they drew protests and public sentiment shifted.",
      "A Kappa Alpha \u201cOld South\u201d parade at Alabama\u2019s Auburn University in 1992 drew supporters waving Confederate battle flags, as well as counter protesters who burned them. In 1995, a group of Kappa Alpha members at the University of Memphis hurled racial slurs while beating a Black student who caused a disturbance outside a frat party, the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported at the time.",
      "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was no exception to the turmoil. Under pressure from student group's, the school's Kappa Alpha chapter in 1985 canceled its annual \u201cSharecropper\u2019s Ball,\" which some attended in blackface. Fraternity members said blackface was worn because the event needed both Black and white attendees, but promised to discontinue the practice, according to a news story in the Daily Tar Heel student newspaper.",
      "The Kappa Alpha chapter at North Carolina\u2019s Wake Forest University stopped allowing members to wear Confederate uniform and display the Confederate flag in 1987.",
      "But other chapters held on longer. The national headquarters finally forbade confederate uniforms in 2010 after a wave of public blowback after Kappa Alpha members at the University of Alabama wore them during a parade that paused in front of the home of a black sorority.",
      "Griffin is not the first public official to draw unwanted attention for their college-age embrace of symbols drawn from the darker chapters of the South's past.",
      "Virginia's then-governor, Democrat Ralph Northam, came under intense criticism in 2019 over a racist photo that appeared on his yearbook page of his medical school. The incident led reporters to scour the college histories of other Southern leaders, forcing a number of politicians to publicly address their time as Kappa Alpha brothers.",
      "Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, then the state\u2019s Republican lieutenant governor, dodged questions in 2019 about photos showing him wearing a Confederate uniform while he was a Kappa Alpha member at Millsaps College in the early 1990s. While Reeves was enrolled there in October 1994, other members of the fraternity were disciplined for wearing afro wigs and Confederate battle flags and shouting racial slurs at black students, the AP reported at the time.",
      "Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declined to comment after yearbooks listed him as the leader of the fraternity's chapter at the University of South Carolina in 1969, along with photos of members wearing Confederate uniforms and posing with a rebel flag.",
      "And Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, also a Republican, expressed regret for participating in \u201cOld South\u201d parties as a student at Auburn University in the 1970s.",

      "A Connecticut prosecutor says a man who told authorities he was held captive in his own home for two decades has asked why his stepmother is not behind bars after being charged with cruelty to persons and other crimes",
      "WATERBURY, Conn. -- A Connecticut man who told authorities was held captive in his own home for two decades since he was still a boy has asked why his stepmother is not behind bars after being charged with cruelty to persons and other crimes, a state prosecutor said Friday.",
      "Don Therkildsen Jr., a supervisory assistant state's attorney, made the remark during a court hearing in Waterbury for Kimberly Sullivan, who pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that also included kidnapping and felony assault. Sullivan was ordered to be placed on electronic monitoring, and Therkildsen also asked for house arrest over concerns she could flee.",
      "\u201cThis victim is afraid. This victim lives in fear,\u201d Therkildsen said in court. \u201cI introduced myself to the victim, explained who I was. His first question in this fear is, \u2018Why is she out walking around when I was locked up in a room for 20 years?\u2019\u201d",
      "Sullivan, 57, posted $300,000 bail after she was arrested March 12. She has denied allegations that she kept her stepson locked in a small room in their Waterbury home and limited his food and liquids so much that he weighed only 69 pounds (31 kilograms) when he was rescued. He is 5-feet-9-inches tall (1.75 meters tall).",
      "Sullivan's lawyer, Ioannis Kaloidis, objected to the house arrest request and said Sullivan has complied with all conditions since she posted bail. He also said threats have been made against Sullivan and confining her to house arrest at one location would put her in danger.",
      "The 32-year-old man set a fire in the house on Feb. 17 in an effort to be free, police said. He was rescued by firefighters and taken to a hospital, where staff said he was emaciated from malnutrition.",
      "He told police that he was locked in the small room with no heat or air conditioning for most of every day since he was about 11 years old, allowed out only briefly to do chores. His father, Kregg Sullivan, let him out of the room for longer periods, but he died last year, police said.",
      "He said he was hungry all the time. He was unenrolled from Waterbury\u2019s public school system in 2004 after educators contacted state child welfare officials with concerns about his well-being, police said. He apparently was going to be home-schooled.",
      "State and local authorities have been looking into how this could have happened, and some are calling for stricter oversight of home-schooling.",
      "Waterbury police have said they visited Sullivan's home twice in 2005 and there were nothing to warrant concern.",
      "A former principal at the elementary school the man attended as a child, Tom Pannone, told WVIT-TV that school officials repeatedly called Sullivan and the state Department of Children and Families, or DCF, over concerns that he was too thin and was stealing food and eating things out of the garbage.",
      "Police said DCF workers visited the home, but it's not clear what the agency did. The man told police that Sullivan made him tell authorities everything was OK under the threat of his food being reduced.",
      "DCF previously said it could not immediately find any records involving the family. On Friday the agency announced that it found some records in its archives and was reviewing them.",
      "Officials did not immediately share details of the records and said they would be providing them to police and state investigators after completing a search and review.",

      "The water in California\u2019s mountain snowpack is just shy of average as spring begins, with more snow coming as a winter storm aims for the Sierra Nevada",
      "The water in California\u2019s mountain snowpack is just shy of average as spring begins, and a winter storm coming to the Sierra Nevada should offer a boost.",
      "The statewide snowpack measured 90% of average on Friday, just ahead of the anticipated April 1 peak before the sun begins melting the snow faster than it can accumulate, sending water flowing into creeks and streams as storms taper off into the spring, said Andy Reising, manager of the Department of Water Resources\u2019 snow surveys and water supply forecasting unit.",
      "\u201cNinety percent is really pretty good. I'm feeling generally positive,\u201d Reising told reporters as snow fell at Phillips Station in the mountains in the eastern part of the state, one of more than 250 sites where measurements were taken.",
      "The news comes as more storms are expected to dump precipitation on Northern California early next week, which prompted officials to bump up the snow survey to avoid traveling during hazardous conditions. It also comes as nearly all of California's reservoirs are above their historic capacity after two wet winters followed a punishing drought that forced severe cutbacks in water usage in cities and on farms.",
      "The snowpack provides about a third of the water used each year in California, which is home to 39 million people and grows much of the country's fresh fruit and vegetables. The state has built a complex system of canals and dams to capture and store the water in reservoirs for the hot, dry months when it doesn\u2019t rain or snow.",
      "While the northern and central parts of the state are flush with water, Reising cautioned that Southern California, including Los Angeles, has received far less precipitation than usual. Most of Southern California is once again in moderate to extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "\u201cWe know floods and droughts can happen at any time. It is the California way of life to expect that,\u201d Reising said.",
      "At Phillips Station, officials recorded a snow depth of 39.5 inches (100 centimeters) and a water content of 17 inches (43 centimeters), which is 70% of average for the location, he said.",
      "The Trump administration has taken a keen interest in California\u2019s water situation, vowing to ensure farmers can tap what they need from a federally run water system that runs in coordination with the state's.",
      "State Water Project allocations are currently at 40% of requested supplies, similar to last year. The Project provides water to 27 million people and 750,000 acres (303,514 hectares) of farmland, and allocations vary considerably during wet and dry years.",
      "Jennifer Pierre, general manager of the State Water Contractors, said she thinks California officials could have released more water this year and wants to see more nimble decision-making in response to rapidly changing conditions.",
      "\u201cWe do have this mismatch between hydrology and the allocation, and what are the different physical and policy changes that need to be made to address that,\u201d Pierre said.",
      "Peter Gleick, co-founder of the Oakland-based Pacific Institute, said the state's major reservoirs are in good shape but California farmers will always want more water than the environment can provide.",
      "\u201cWe should never let a good water year let us become complacent,\u201d Gleick said. \u201cWe never have enough water to waste.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- A federal judge in Denver is set to hear arguments Friday over whether an immigration and labor activist who took refuge in Colorado churches to avoid deportation during the first Trump administration should be freed from detention.",
      "Jeanette Vizguerra was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on March 17 and is being held at its immigration detention facility in suburban Denver.",
      "ICE says Vizguerra entered the U.S. from Mexico illegally in 1997 and is being held pending deportation. In a statement shortly after her arrest, ICE said the mother of four has a final deportation order and \u201chas received legal due process in U.S. immigration court.\u201d",
      "But her lawyers say the order is not valid. They have filed a legal challenge asking U.S. District Judge Nina Wang to order federal authorities to release her.",

Vizguerra did not know the number belonged to someone else at the time, the lawsuit said.",
      "While a judge issued an order of removal against her, she also was given the option to leave the country voluntarily, which she ultimately did to try to see her mother before she died in 2012, her lawyers said in the current petition before Wang.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Luigi Mangione is asking for a laptop in jail, but just for legal purposes \u2014 not for communicating with anyone \u2014 as he awaits trial in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO.",
      "In a court filing made public late Monday, Mangione's lawyers proposed that he get a laptop configured solely to let him view a vast amount of documents, video and other material in the case surrounding the shooting of Brian Thompson. Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal lockup where Mangione is being held.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Mangione's lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.",
      "Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there's \u201cno connection to Mr. Mangione for any of said alleged threats.\u201d",
      "Mangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference. Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.",
      "Mangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges. He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He hasn't entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.",
      "Thompson's killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.",
      "But at the same time, the case channeled some Americans\u2019 frustrations with health insurance companies. Mangione's writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.",
      "Some people have lionized the accused killer, donated money to his defense and even flocked to his court appearances. Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.",
      "Through his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.",
      "If he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday's filing. But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.",
      "Otherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there aren't enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defense.",

      "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington to its pioneering robotaxi service's steadily expanding list of U.S. markets, although passengers will have to wait until next year until they can take a driverless ride around the nation's capital city.",
      "For now, Waymo's robotaxis will continue to map Washington's streets and corridors with a safety driver sitting behind the wheel to take control of the vehicle if something goes wrong \u2014 a precaution required under the regulations currently in force in the District of Columbia.",
      "That's something Waymo already has been doing since it began sending out its robotaxis in Washington in late January after a brief trial run in the capital last year.",

Waymo and Uber also are teaming up to begin dispatching its robotaxis in Atlanta later this year.",
      "The growth has helped turn what began as a head-turning novelty in Phoenix and then in San Francisco into an increasingly common sight in the cities where Waymo operates. The company says it had provided more than 4 million driverless rides to paying customers through the end of this year, and is now providing them at a pace of 200,000 paid trips per week.",
      "That has established Waymo as the early frontrunner in driverless technology while others are racing to catch up.

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out her plans for the UK economy in her Spring Statement and is on track to meet her self-imposed rules on the public finances, which she has said are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "On the face of it, that sounds like a good thing. So why are people saying that she may struggle to meet them and the only way she may do so is by raising taxes?",
      "It's a complicated picture, but there are essentially five steps to get from where we are now to tax rises.",
      "Not much spare money",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed financial rules, one of which is to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",
      "In October, the government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said that Reeves would be able to meet that rule with \u00a39.9bn to spare.",
      "An increase in government borrowing costs since then meant that that room to spare had disappeared. Now big welfare cuts and spending reductions in the Spring Statement have restored it.",
      "Almost \u00a310bn may sound like a lot, but it's a relatively small amount in an economy that spends \u00a31 trillion a year, and raises around the same in tax.",
      "In fact it is the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time is three times bigger at \u00a330bn.",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "\"It is a tiny fraction of the risks to the outlook,\" Richard Hughes from the OBR told the BBC.",
      "He said there were many factors that could \"wipe out\" the chancellor's headroom, including an escalating trade war, any small downgrade to growth forecasts or a rise in interest rates.",
      "Predicting the future is difficult",
      "Which brings us on to the precarious nature of making economic forecasts.",
      "\"All forecasts turn out to be wrong. Weather forecasts also turn out to be wrong,\" says Mr Hughes.",
      "Predicting what will happen in the future, especially in five years' time is hard, and is subject to revisions. You could be forgiven for not predicting a war or a pandemic, for instance.",
      "The respected think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has already said there is \"a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an Autumn Budget\".",
      "A case in point, only hours after Reeves delivered her statement in parliament, US President Donald Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts coming into the US.",
      "Car tariffs a sign worse could come",
      "Reeves admitted the car tariffs would be \"bad for the UK\" but insisted the government was in \"extensive\" talks to avoid them being imposed here.",
      "According to the OBR, these import taxes would have a direct impact on goods totalling around 0.2% of GDP.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the OBR had warned of the risk of an escalating trade war, and while the proposals do not exactly match the watchdog's worst-case scenario, which would see the UK retaliate, Hughes said it had elements of it.",
      "Although 0.2% is a tiny amount, nevertheless it will affect the economy.",

      "Trump's trade policies and the fact that nobody seems to know whether he will follow through with his threats, U-turn on them, or how he will react to others is just one way his presidency is making the world so uncertain at the moment.",
      "The war in Ukraine continues, despite Trump's pledge to end it.",
      "The UK, along with Germany, has said it will increase defence spending. Trump has long called for European members of Nato to spend more on defence, and there are also fears that if the US does make a deal with Russia to end the war, that could leave Europe vulnerable.",
      "Domestically, businesses are also facing a worrying time as they brace for a rise in costs in April as employers' National Insurance contributions, the National Living wage and business rates are all set to go up.",
      "Some firms have said they have put off investment decisions as a result, and many have warned of price rises or job cuts. If these materialise, then that will knock growth.",
      "Break the rules or raise taxes",
      "Given all of the above, if the chancellor's headroom were to disappear, why would that matter?",
      "Reeves has staked her reputation on meeting her fiscal rules, pledging to bring \"iron discipline\" and provide stability and reassurance to financial markets, in contrast to former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets and raised interest rates.",
      "So if she is still to meet her rules and not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, that would mean either more spending cuts or tax rises.",
      "The government has already announced big cuts to the welfare bill as well as plans to cut the civil service and abolish several quangos including NHS England.",
      "But as Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, puts it: \"Non-defence spending can only be cut so far.\"",
      "By leaving herself so little wiggle room and with such a precarious economic outlook, \"we can surely now expect six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn,\" says Paul Johnson from the IFS.",
      "That speculation itself can cause economic harm, he says.",

      "Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.",
      "Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.",
      "Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.",
      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",
      "Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.",
      "It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.",
      "He ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".",
      "Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.",
      "It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.",
      "\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".",
      "A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.",
      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",
      "Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.",
      "Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.",
      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",
      "\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' custodians.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.",
      "In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.",
      "One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.",
      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",
      "Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.",
      "He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.",
      "\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

      "The closure led to a public row between Farage and the bank, which later admitted \"serious failings\" in its treatment of the politician. The fallout also led to the resignation of NatWest's chief executive, Dame Alison Rose.",

      "The dispute began in 2023, when Farage, a prominent Brexiteer, said Coutts planned to shut down his account and that he had not been given a reason.",
      "The BBC reported that his account was being closed because he no longer met the wealth threshold for Coutts, citing a source familiar with the matter.",
      "However, the former UKIP leader later obtained a report from the bank which indicated his political views were also considered.",
      "NatWest's chief executive Dame Alison resigned in July 2023 after admitting she had made a mistake in speaking about Mr Farage's relationship with the bank.",
      "A public debate also followed over people being having their bank accounts shut due to their views. Farage said he was later refused personal and business accounts at seven more banks in the UK.",
      "An independent report found NatWest failed to communicate its decision properly when it decided to shut Farage's Coutts account.",
      "But the closure was lawful, and based mainly on commercial reasons, the report said."

      "Housebuilding is forecast to hit a 40-year high, with reforms to the planning system expected to boost the economy by \u00a36.8bn, according to the independent spending watchdog.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said changes including mandatory housing targets for councils and making it easier to build on green belt land could result in 1.3 million new homes across the UK by the end of the decade.",
      "The government said further planned reforms and investment in affordable housing would help to meet its target of 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years.",
      "But the OBR warned its estimates were uncertain as factors such as the number of construction workers could hinder progress.",
      "Industry leaders have said tens of thousands of new recruits will be needed to deliver the government's target, with the sector facing a skills shortage and ageing workforce.",
      "Earlier this week, the government announced \u00a3600m of funding to train up to 60,000 more skilled construction workers.",
      "The OBR said local opposition could also delay or prevent new homes.",
      "Critics have argued the reforms could disregard local concerns, while some councils have warned higher housing targets will be almost impossible to achieve, pointing to strains on local infrastructure and land shortages.",
      "The Home Builders Federation said planning changes were \"a very positive step\" but the OBR figures showed further \"urgent\" measures to help homebuyers were needed to meet the government's target.",
      "Chief executive Neil Jefferson said the cost of building new homes had also \"rocketed\" in recent years, with new taxes and regulatory fees further supressing investment.",

      "There had been a question mark over whether the OBR would factor the government's planning reforms into its forecasts for economic growth.",
      "However, in her Spring Statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed the watchdog had considered and scored changes to the National Planning Policy Framework published in December.",
      "The OBR said the reforms could boost housebuilding by 170,000 over the next five years, resulting in 1.3 million new homes across the UK by 2029/30, a 16% increase.",
      "It added that the number of new homes annually was projected to reach a 40-year high of 305,000.",
      "The watchdog estimated the boost to housebuilding as a result of the reforms would increase the size of the UK economy by 0.2% by 2029/30, worth around \u00a36.8bn in today's prices.",
      "The government said this was the biggest positive effect on growth from a  \"zero-cost policy\" the OBR had ever forecast.",
      "The boost to economic growth is driven by factors including higher productivity in the construction sector, more people paying rent and making it easier for people to move for work.",
      "The OBR said the increase in supply would lead to a small reduction in average house prices of around 0.9% by 2029/30.",
      "Experts said while the boost from planning reforms was welcome there needed to be more focus on first-time buyers who are struggling to get on the housing ladder.",
      "Felicity Barnett, from the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said many prospective homeowners were \"trapped by strict affordability criteria\" and needed more accessible options.",
      "Aynsley Lammin, an analyst at Investec, said a good economic backdrop, favourable interest rates and policies to help first-time buyers were needed to boost demand.",
      "He added that the government would also need to invest in affordable homes.",
      "Under the government's new planning framework previously developed land - known as \"brownfield\" sites - will be prioritised for new homes.",
      "But ministers have acknowledged this will not be enough to meet the government's target.",

      "UK inflation fell by more than expected in February, driven by a drop in clothing and shoe prices due to an unusually high number of sales.",

      "The latest figures come ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spring Statement, where she will set out her economic plans.",
      "Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said women's clothing \"was the biggest driver for this month's fall\".",
      "\"This was only partially offset by small increases, for example, from alcoholic drinks\", he added.",
      "Overall prices for clothing and footwear fell in the year to February for the first time since 2021, with children's clothing and accessories such as hats and scarves also having an impact.",
      "The ONS said another factor was an unseasonably high number of clothing sales. Discounting usually drops off in February as January sales end and spring ranges enter the shops, but that did not happen this year.",
      "Economists polled by Reuters had expected that inflation - which measures the rate at which prices rise  - would dip to 2.9% in February. However, despite the bigger than expected fall, the figure is still above the Bank of England's target of 2%.",
      "The rate of price rises is also expected to increase in the months ahead, with council tax and energy and water bills all set to rise in April.",
      "In addition, a recent survey from the ONS found that almost a half of businesses are considering price rises as they brace for next month's tax rises and increase in the National Living Wage.",
      "Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Bank of England was unlikely to cut rates at its next meeting because February's fall was \"not an enormous change\" and inflation \"is still significantly above target\",",
      "\"Although policymakers won't want to keep rates too high for too long given the stagnation in the economy, they are set to stay cautious with a rate cut looking more likely to come in June and another later in the year\", she said.",

      "Reeves will address Parliament with her Spring Statement in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, with further cuts to welfare spending expected.",
      "She is also expected to confirm a downgrade to official economic growth predictions.",
      "Some economists have raised concerns about the possibility of 'stagflation', where prices rise faster than the central bank's target but the economy fails to grow.",
      "\"Economic growth is miniscule and risks going backwards, but should inflation continue to refuse to get back near the 2% target, it is difficult to see what the Bank of England can do with interest rates,\" said Lindsay James from wealth manager Quilter.",
      "Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said the government's \"number one mission is kickstarting growth\" and pledged to go \"further and faster on growth through our plan for change\".",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives left government in July \"with inflation bang on target\" and urged Reeves take \"urgent action\" in her Spring Statement or \"working families will continue to pay the price\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats said the inflation figure \"will be of no comfort to the millions of families across the country who are struggling\"."

      "Speaking in January, he said he was willing to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and \"golf all day long\" if it benefits his country, drawing laughter in the room.",
      "And that idea may not be too far-fetched. The Trump Organization is planning to invest billions of dollars in golf courses, hotels and real estate in Vietnam, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "The first project will reportedly be a residential complex with three 18-hole golf courses, which will break ground in May.",
      "The BBC has contacted the company and its Vietnamese partner for comment.",
      "But could golf diplomacy really work?",
      "'Bamboo' economics",
      "Trump has previously said Vietnam was \"worse than China\" and \"almost the single worst abuser of anybody\".",
      "But he has not yet specifically targeted Vietnam with tariffs, even though it has the third largest trade deficit with the US, after China and Mexico.",
      "Analysts say Vietnam is doing well at engaging with Washington - but its efforts may still not be enough to avoid most of Trump's tariff plans.",
      "\"The Vietnam PM seems to be taking a page from the book of [former Japanese PM] Shinzo Abe, who built a close personal relationship with Trump over their shared love of golf,\" said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator.",
      "\"I would not however expect any special treatment of Vietnam from a policy point of view. Personal relationships are important to Trump, but in this case, I believe his desire to appear tough on trade will win out.\"",
      "Vietnam has said it doesn't plan to \"restrict trade\" with the US, although it currently taxes some imports from there.",
      "The government said this week that it will allow SpaceX, which is owned by close Trump ally Elon Musk, to operate its Starlink satellite internet service in the country on a trial basis.",
      "Some analysts see this as one of the measures Vietnam has taken to avoid being hit with US tariffs.",
      "Hanoi also said it will lower tariffs on several US imports, including energy and cars, a move aimed at \"improving trade balances\".",
      "It came less than two weeks after Vietnamese and US companies signed more than $4bn (\u00a35.4bn) in deals, in areas including oil and gas exploration.",
      "Steve Norris from the consultancy Control Risks said \"Vietnam is being careful to avoid any moves which would signal any non-cooperation on trade issues\".",
      "This strategy is in line with its foreign policy approach - known as \"bamboo diplomacy\". Like shoots of plants that sway with the wind, Vietnam hopes to be adaptable to foreign pressures.",
      "\"If the US were to increase pressure on Vietnam, the government might respond with offers to facilitate investments in the hospitality and casino industries, undertake advanced machinery purchases, and \u2013 capturing the moment \u2013 consider access to Vietnam's rare earth minerals,\" Mr Norris said.",
      "What about China?",
      "One big factor working against Vietnam is concerns about China's influence.",
      "Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term.",
      "In 2018, he hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam.",
      "This has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure.",
      "Former US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said Vietnam has emerged as a \"destination for major Chinese investment\".",
      "While the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data.",
      "Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year.",
      "\"These are huge red flags for Trump. My expectation is that Vietnam will at some point be hit hard by tariffs,\" Mr Olson said.",
      "However, tariffs on Vietnam could impact US businesses such as tech firms Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike, which have moved production lines from China to Vietnam.",
      "A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed.",
      "The US president believes the levies will boost his country's economy by encouraging more businesses to make goods in the US and bring in billions of dollars of taxes.",
      "But many economists have warned that it could force up prices for American consumers and negatively impact global trade.",
      "What comes next?",
      "Washington is also concerned about so-called \"trans-shipments\" - Chinese goods passing through Vietnam on their way to other countries.",
      "US officials have been \"quietly stressing to Vietnam that it must reduce its trade surplus over time and combat the trans-shipment of Chinese goods through the country,\" Mr Norris said.",
      "Vietnam's prime minister has said he is confident that his administration can \"handle the relationship with the US\".",
      "Now that the South East Asian nation has cut some tariffs on US goods they may be more attractive to Vietnamese consumers, increasing America's share of trade with the country.",
      "And then there is golf - playing a game with Trump had worked for the late Japanese leader Shinzo Abe.",
      "Abe and Trump established a friendship, which included many golf games over several years. The friendship arguably helped Abe secure tariff exemptions for Japan's critical car industry at the time.",
      "For now, it is unclear if Vietnam would really give golf diplomacy a swing.",

    "summary": "Shares in technology firms have both fallen and risen sharply over the past year.",
    "story": [
      "We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar?",
      "No? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".",
      "We only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.",
      "A great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.",
      "Tech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls.",
      "Nvidia shares sink as Chinese AI app spooks markets",
      "Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk",
      "US tech firms feel pinch from China tariffs",
      "A principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.",
      "\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"",
      "Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.",
      "Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.",
      "As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"",
      "But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.",
      "So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.",
      "On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.",
      "That means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.",
      "\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.",
      "\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"",
      "Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.",
      "So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?",
      "Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.",
      "There is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.",
      "Take Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors.",
      "Meanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals.",
      "The instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing.",
      "AI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right.",
      "Or as Prof Dimon puts it: \"At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough.\"",
      "And not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \"AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on.\"",
      "That means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.",
      "Then there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.",
      "In short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last.",
      "It is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.",

      "\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Philip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.",
      "In exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.",
      "We're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.",
      "Water and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.",
      "Philip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.",
      "More importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.",
      "So cheap it made business sense for Philip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.",
      "Each machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.",
      "Occasionally Philip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.",
      "At the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Philip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.",
      "\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.",
      "Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.",
      "It was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.",
      "British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.",
      "Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.",
      "Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.",
      "\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.",
      "The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.",
      "Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.",
      "The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.",
      "Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.",
      "Although the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses.",
      "So, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.",
      "\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"",
      "He's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.",
      "\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"",
      "Embracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.",
      "Elsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.",
      "Like many young people, they're glued to their phones.",
      "\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.",
      "The little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.",
      "\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.",
      "\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.",
      "\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"",
      "Not many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.",
      "But soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.",
      "Zengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.",
      "Soon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.",
      "Phillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.",
      "The company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.",
      "Gridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.",
      "North of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.",
      "But Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.",
      "The company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.",
      "They're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.",
      "\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.",
      "The company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.",
      "Finding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.",
      "The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.",
      "But the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.",
      "History tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.",
      "In the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.",
      "Authorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.",
      "For example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.",
      "Agreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.",
      "The environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.",
      "But according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.",
      "Set ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.",

    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",
      "It concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns.",
      "Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "From April 2026, there will be a charge of 20% inheritance tax on agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m for the first time, although the threshold for some farmers to pay would be \u00a33m.",
      "The government expects the changes to affect the wealthiest 500 estates each year.",
      "Ministers have maintained it will make things \"fairer\" and protect \"small family farms\".",
      "Bridgette said it means family farms, like hers, are now needing to save up to pay the tax \"for whenever one generation needs to pass the farm onto the next\".",

      "She said she was concerned family farms could have to be sold off, which would have an impact on the wider rural economy.",
      "She said: \"We use tyre companies, machinery sales, vets, mechanics, feed companies - it affects a lot of the economy locally.\"",
      "Bridgette also thought food prices could go up for consumers if there was less competition from family farms against imported meat and crops.",
      "Earlier this month, the government announced it was closing an environmental funding stream to new applicants, which had been designed to replace EU farm subsidies, post-Brexit.",
      "The government said the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) had been a success, with 37,000 funding agreements agreed.",
      "Bridgette's farm receives SFI for environmental management including conserving hedgerows and trees.",
      "The government said all the scheme's budget had been allocated and no more new applications could be accepted.",
      "Bridgette said this announcement \"shut the door in the face\" of farmers who were preparing to apply.",
      "\"They've done all the paperwork to calculate the land that will go into it and all the other bits that are involved,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The boss of one of the UK's biggest energy providers says people living in Scotland could have the cheapest electricity in Europe.",
      "Greg Jackson, who founded Octopus Energy, wants the electricity market to be reformed to introduce zonal pricing.",
      "He argues that if prices were based on local generation, the high levels of renewable energy being produced in Scotland would keep bills low.",
      "But rival electricity firms say zonal pricing would create a postcode lottery and could lead to major infrastructure projects currently planned for Scotland being switched to other parts of the UK.",
      "The UK government is currently exploring options for major reform in the electricity market.",
      "Those options include regional or zonal pricing, which is used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden.",
      "At the moment, the wholesale price of electricity applies across the whole of Great Britain \u2013 and is based on the cost of the most expensive unit generated across the area at that time.",
      "The national grid's reliance on gas, the most expensive source of power, keeps bills high - even if there's also large-scale generation coming from cheaper renewable sources, like wind power.",
      "Under a zonal pricing system, bills would instead be linked to the most expensive unit generated in a specific area.",
      "Because Scotland is already a net exporter of renewable electricity, the argument is that the country's bills would be much cheaper.",
      "Mr Jackson, whose company is now the UK's largest domestic energy supplier, described the existing system as \"crazy.\"",
      "He said it does nothing to bring down bills and that billions are being wasted in payments to switch off wind farms when demand is low.",
      "He told BBC Scotland News that under zonal pricing, bills in Scotland - where there is \"a lot of renewable generation\" - would be \"cut very significantly from where they are now\".",
      "He said that amount would vary across Scotland, but some bills would fall by hundreds of pounds a year.",
      "However, other energy companies - including Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern Electricity (SSE) - are opposed to the idea.",
      "Last month, they were among 55 firms who wrote a six-page letter to the UK government raising \"grave concerns\" around zonal pricing and saying it would do nothing to reduce bills.",
      "SSE said those in favour of the scheme had used \"flawed logic\" and that it would create a \"postcode lottery\" for energy bills.",
      "The chief executive of Scottish Power, Keith Anderson, told BBC Scotland News that it would also create uncertainty around \u00a375bn worth of investments.",
      "This initiative to \"rewire the country,\" the biggest in the history of the UK's electricity system, would see large new transmission pylons installed to increase the amount of new renewable energy being shifted around the country.",
      "However, he warned that such projects could be diverted to other parts of the UK to bring down bills in those areas by making each region less reliant on expensive fossil fuel generation.",
      "\"What we're saying is, let's build it, let's get all the economic growth for the UK, let's get gas away from the electricity system, let's bring down people's bills and then look at whether we need a zonal pricing system,\" he said.",
      "Mr Anderson insists the aim should be to bring down bills for the whole of the UK, rather than in certain regions where renewables are in abundance.",
      "He says zonal pricing is meant to encourage investment in particular parts of the country - but fails to recognise that wind farms need to be built in places where it's windy.",
      "Octopus boss Mr Jackson believes that more renewable energy capacity could still be built in Scotland.",
      "He also says cheaper prices would encourage data centre operators, who use vast amounts of energy, to build their sites north of the border.",
      "Mr Jackson says that would reduce the amount of network upgrades needed to shift the electricity from where it's generated to where it's consumed, and make the overall system more efficient.",
      "But that has been dismissed by Scottish Power, which says data centres have to be built close to the largest populations to maximise their response times for connectivity.",
      "Mr Anderson and Mr Jackson both quote separate research that supports their arguments.",

    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",
      "That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.",

    "summary": "The Chancellor hints at a more guarded approach amid global uncertainty - and issues a warning ahead of her announcements.",
    "story": [
      "In a discussion ahead of next week's statement, the chancellor hints at a more guarded approach amid global uncertainty - and issues a warning.",
      "A thick skin is a must for our top politicians. There's rolling news, nonstop social media and public scepticism. Add in the battle with the country's deep and persistent problems. And these days the problems include constant and very real global turmoil.",
      "The questions for the politicians are profound and that's something the Chancellor Rachel Reeves gets.",
      "\"I recognise that with the privilege of doing a job like the one I'm doing today also comes a great deal of scrutiny. I absolutely believe that every policy that I announce, every pound of public money, of taxpayers money that I spend, and every pound that I take from people in terms of taxes is properly scrutinised. That's part of the job,\" she tells me.",
      "But next comes an admission, from this professionally tough politician, described to me by one of her colleagues once as 'hard as nails', that when things get personal, she doesn't like it.",
      "\"One of the things I think that I find hard, even with the thicker skin I guess I must have developed over these last 14 or so years, is some of the personal criticism because that's not the sort of politics that I do,\" she tells me.",
      "As admissions go it's modest and general in nature.",
      "But read in the context of someone who is taking decisions with big consequences for many, many people's lives while at the same time being someone who has faced awkward questions about her own job history and CV, this may be Reeves' way of telling us that she's feeling the heat.",
      "Real anxiety in the Labour party",
      "Perhaps the admission came because this was an unusual conversation. We were not under the studio lights but instead in the Treasury itself for the making of a BBC documentary, The Making of a Chancellor, trying to understand the thinking behind the big decisions Reeves takes.",
      "Our conversation came a couple of hours after the Labour government had revealed  billions of pounds of welfare cuts, most notably stricter tests for personal independence payments (Pips). The aim is to save \u00a35bn by 2030.",
      "But there is real anxiety in her party about what she and Sir Keir Starmer are doing.",
      "And when I ask the chancellor about these cuts, she prefers to speak about Labour's broader vision for the economy, instead giving a warning - that this Labour government won't be able to do what its members and backers might have expected and hand out handsome increases to government departments like its predecessor.",
      "\"There's growth, real growth every year actually, in public spending, but not at the levels that we were able to deliver under the last Labour government when the economy was growing much more strongly,\" she tells me.",
      "\"We've got to ramp it up and continue to ensure that we're doing everything we can to lift living standards and in the end that is through growing the economy. We can't tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services. That's not available in the world we live in today.\"",
      "The signalling for the Spring Statement is that there will be no more tax rises and no more increases in government spending, instead a scalpel is set to be taken to some departments. This is the opposite of what she did in the autumn and the opposite of what you'd assume Labour chancellors do.",
      "This more guarded approach is in part a response to the uncertainty created by the Trump administration - nobody knows quite what is around the corner.",
      "How long are people willing to wait?",
      "But she has been taking inspiration from across the Atlantic for many years.",
      "One of Reeves' first jobs was working as an economist at the British Embassy in Washington from 2002 to 2003. That era defined her early thinking and she's still gazing to America for inspiration \u2013 Reeves' first call as chancellor was to Janet Yellen, then her counterpart in DC as treasury secretary in president Joe Biden's administration.",
      "I ask Yellen for her advice to Reeves now, nearly a year on. She says to keep doing the difficult things: \"I think she [Reeves] should, you know, stick with the course that she set out and move things, move things forward with, you know, as much speed and commitment as she possibly can.\"",
      "But there is tension in Reeves' approach. Labour is increasing tax, but squeezing some spending. Ministers are rolling back some rules and regulations, but giving workers more rights at work. In effect they are putting the brakes and the accelerator on at the same time.",
      "She is aware there is no one thing she can do to suddenly create prosperity. And so how long can people be expected to wait for the change they've been promised?",
      "Communication is key according to Yellen: \"Before you get improvements that are noticeable to voters in infrastructure and job creation, it does take time and so you don't get the immediate payoff.",
      "\"And so communication, I think, is very important to make the population understand that this is an approach that requires some patience to see the payoff. But truly, it's the only way, over the medium term, to boost living standards in major economies.\"",
      "Reeves: 'The world has changed'",
      "Reeves is asking voters to believe that some of the tough choices she is making can be explained, at least in part, by the fact that the world around her has changed in a way she hadn't anticipated when her party was beginning to prepare its new offer to the public in the aftermath of Labour's 2019 election defeat.",
      "First, a massive \u00a328bn borrowing that had been earmarked to spend on green projects was binned, a necessary response to the economic turmoil under Liz Truss according to Labour - not a view shared by opponents who never thought Labour's policy credible.",
      "Whereas once she said she would be the first green chancellor, now Reeves is signing off airport expansion at Heathrow, proposing to get rid of regulations, and ousting the regulator at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).",
      "Labour argues the country's economic books were worse than expected when they took power. And much more recently, uncertainty over Donald Trump's willingness to support Ukraine and Nato more widely has seen the UK commit more money to defence.",
      "\"The world has changed, [we] can see it before our eyes, in a whole number of respects,\" Reeves tells me.",
      "\"[We are seeing] greater instability and insecurity in the world, Europe having to take on a bigger role in our continent for our own defence.\"",
      "What kind of Labour politician Reeves is",
      "But to some, Reeves' willingness to change course raises the question as to what kind of Labour politician she is.",
      "The cuts to welfare are at the heart of this. At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir declared that welfare reform was a \"moral issue\", while the veteran left-wing MP Diane Abbott argued there was \"nothing moral about cutting the benefits of millions of people\".",
      "Reeves sat out much of Labour's doomed period with Jeremy Corbyn as leader. She was always serious, watchful, with an eye on her party's and her own future.",
      "When she became shadow chancellor she put enormous efforts into schmoozing the city, even if she did once confess she'd instruct her team to sweep up any left over pastries at the end of their business breakfasts.",
      "Reeves sees herself as a pragmatic politician, not an ideologue, whether that means increasing taxes in her first budget to fund public services or conversely cutting benefits in this week's statement.",
      "Deborah Mattinson was Sir Keir's director of strategy up until the election. She argues Reeves is canny and it is her values that make her Labour.",
      "\"She is very, very savvy. She's good at looking around corners.",
      "\"It's a cliche to say she's a chess player, but actually it is true that she's not somebody who deals with the problem that's right in front of her and leaves it there. She's somebody who is able to look several moves ahead and always has that slightly longer-term focus.\"",
      "Labour and the economy: a trust problem",
      "Reeves would tell you her politics were made at home, her values that of the south London girl who worked hard and made it to the Bank of England, her economics crafted by study and experience but also the requirements of getting elected \u2013 remember she chose politics not economics after all.",
      "That, according to Deborah Mattison is key. The decisions Reeves takes are based squarely on ensuring Labour is viewed as economically credible. The argument is that if it isn't seen as sufficiently credible it won't be in power and then nothing else really matters.",
      "\"You can't win an election if you're not trusted to run the economy. And Labour has a historical problem that goes back a very, very long way,\" she tells me.",
      "\"After [the election defeat] in 2010, that all dissipated\u2026 [and] the Corbyn years, really, really were problematic. So that's the situation that she inherited and we were no further forward by the time she was appointed shadow chancellor.",
      "\"By the time we went into the election, she had a double-digit lead over her Tory opposite number. That is one hell of an achievement.\"",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "Like her predecessors in New Labour, Reeves takes the view that the public is less interested in Labour's economic ideology and more interested in delivering economic prosperity. (Her opponents on the left of the party would argue a clear ideological stance and economic success are not mutually exclusive).",
      "However there is one clear division between Reeves and Gordon Brown, chancellor between 1997-2007. Whereas Brown made little secret of his craving to be prime minister, Reeves says she doesn't have the same goal.",
      "\"I honestly have no desire whatsoever to do that job. That's not always the answer you might get from chancellor of the exchequer, but in my case, it's absolutely true. The job I've always wanted is this one.",
      "\"And I'm very, very lucky because there aren't many people in politics or in other walks of life that manage to do the job that they've always dreamed of perhaps. And for me, I'm doing that today in this job.\"",
      "But make no mistake, next week's Spring Statement is the stuff of nightmares for a Labour chancellor. Her party will hate the cuts to welfare.",
      "And at the same time, borrowing and unemployment are ticking up and there is no sign of the economy budging, even though getting it to grow is Labour's number one mission.",
      "Rachel Reeves is the architect and face of her government's economic plans. If she is indeed feeling the heat, perhaps it's little surprise.",

    "story": [
      "There were 8,000 more secondary school pupils in special schools in England than places available for them last year, according to Department for Education (Dfe) figures - a rise of 25% in 12 months.",
      "About two-thirds of these schools were at or over capacity in 2023-2024, despite the number of special school places rising by 5,000.",
      "On Thursday, the government said the \u00a3740m of funding investment it announced in December will create 10,000 new school places for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) within mainstream schools.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said it will help plug \"the significant gaps in provision\".",
      "An estimated 1.7 million school-aged children have special educational needs and disabilities in England.",
      "Those with further needs can receive legal entitlement to more specific support, often in a specialist school, via an education, health and care plan (EHCP).",
      "The number of pupils with an EHCP, who need a place in specialist provision, is forecast by local authorities to rise by 44,000 in the next three years - from 229,000 in 2024-25 to 273,000 in 2028-29.",
      "This is the second year figures on special school capacity have been collected by the Dfe.",
      "It says the reason for the gap in provision is because of the number of schools at or over capacity. However, the figures may not reflect the current pupils attending special schools because of the different and changing needs for which schools cater.",
      "It found there were 92,000 secondary places across special state schools in England, but about 100,000 secondary pupils on the roll in May 2024.",
      "In a highly critical report earlier this year, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system \"in disarray\", \"mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money\".",
      "It warned 40% of councils would be \"staring down bankruptcy\" next year, when a scheme allowing local authorities to keep those deficits off their financial books expires.",
      "The government is encouraging local authorities to help mainstream schools to set up more provision for children with Send within their own schools.",
      "Fewer than one in 10 mainstream schools have SEN units or resourced provision which provide more intensive support for pupils, according to the Dfe.",
      "It hopes to reform the system to be more inclusive so children's need can be identified and met at an earlier point in mainstream schools, and special schools can cater to those with the most complex needs.",
      "Releasing more details on the plans, Phillipson said: \"This investment is a big step towards delivering not only enough school places, but the right school places, supporting all children and particularly those with Send, and plugging the significant gaps in provision we inherited\".",
      "Elsewhere, the figures on school capacity show 16% of primary schools are over capacity, down 1% on last year, and 24% of secondary schools, up 1% on last year.",
      "There has been an increase in 24,000 school places overall, but this is falling because of the reduction in pupil numbers since 2018-19.",
      "It has been predicted the number of children in state nurseries and primary schools would fall by 4.5% over the next four years, but it varies across England.",

      "The University of Sussex was fined \u00a3585,000 after the OfS said its equality policy - which included rules to \"positively represent trans people\" - could prevent staff and students voicing opposing views. Sussex was investigated after Prof Kathleen Stock left the university in 2021 accused of transphobia.",
      "Arif Ahmed, OfS director for freedom of speech, said the fine could have been as high as \u00a33.7m and there was \"potential for higher fines in the future\".",
      "Universities have told the OfS they were concerned about how to uphold free speech while preventing hate speech.",
      "The University of Sussex was the first to be fined under new powers given to the OfS in January.",

      "The watchdog said the \"chilling effect\" this would have on anyone wanting to voice an opposing view meant the university failed in its duty to uphold freedom of speech on campus.",
      "Prof Kathleen Stock, who left the university in 2021 after being accused of transphobia for her views on sex and gender issues, has said other universities should pay attention to the record fine issued to Sussex.",

      "He added: \"I think universities should be looking at their policies and thinking carefully about what they need to do to comply with the law and to comply with regulatory requirements.\"",
      "The report said maximum penalties for universities would be capped at whichever is higher: 2% of a university's annual \"qualifying income\" - the amount they receive from tuition fees and OfS grants - or \u00a3500,000.",
      "Many universities post incomes in the hundreds of millions every year, meaning maximum fines could comfortably reach seven figures.",
      "The University of Sussex fine was capped at \u00a34.6m, the OfS said, adding that an \"appropriate deterrent\" against future breaches could be achieved with the lower fine.",

      "That's vastly more than the 20 million who pay for video streaming, but the number of new subscribers is tailing off. About 1.25 million new customers took out a plan last year, said MIDiA, representing growth of 4%. In 2020, that figure was 9%.",
      "MIDiA says the slowdown will lead to higher prices. \"If you're not growing users, what do you do? You get them to pay more,\" said the company's managing director, Mark Mulligan.",

      "\"We've really tried with mid-price tiers and, frankly, struggled to get them to work,\" he said.",
      "Users who don't want to pay can already access a \"pretty robust\" offering on ad-supported services like YouTube; while a monthly subscription offers millions of songs to everyone.",
      "\"Finding something in the middle that you can actually explain to consumers and that is different than what's already on offer has been really, really challenging,\" he explained.",
      "Outside of the UK,  MIDiA's latest report showed that the number of people subscribing to music streaming services grew by 11.6% year-on-year.",
      "Most of the growth came from emerging markets in Africa and India. China also extended its lead as the world's biggest streaming market, with 190 million subscribers.",
      "Mulligan predicted that the growth of streaming services outside Europe and America could change the way we listen to music.",
      "\"We'll see a cultural shift where these massive installed bases of streaming users in the global south will shape listening habits in the west.",
      "\"As they become bigger markets, more people [in those countries] will want to become artists, and more people will want to set up record labels.",
      "\"So more music will be made, more music will be exported, and there'll be a sort of cultural rebalancing.\"",
      "The change has already begun. According to the IFPI, Sub-Saharan Africa was the world's fastest-growing music market last year, with revenues surpassing $100 million (\u00a3770,000) for the first time.",
      "Genres like Afrobeats and Amapiano are already hugely popular and, last year, Nigerian star Burna Boy became the first African artist to headline a stadium show in the UK.",
      "South Korea is also a powerhouse - accounting for 45% of all physical albums sold in the last year - while Latin America boasts some of the world's biggest recording artists, including Bad Bunny, Karol G and Peso Pluma.",
      "As a result, the UK's historic musical dominance is waning.",
      "Last year, British musicians failed to appear in the Top 10 of the world's bestselling singles or albums, for the first time in two decades.",
      "\"In basic terms, the democratisation of music that we've seen, thanks to streaming, is wonderful - but it's a very crowded space,\" Victoria Oakley, head of the IFPI, told BBC News.",
      "\"The UK is seeing breakthrough artists like Myles Smith and Lola Young,\" she added, \"but that journey is rarely about overnight success these days.",
      "\"It can take five or six or seven years to get to the point where you're a big household name, winning awards and number one albums.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:11:26 GMT",
    "summary": "The TV couple are opening up their home and their lives in a new reality series for BBC One.",
    "story": [
      "We might feel like we know Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash already. We have seen them live off rice and beans in the Australian rainforest in I'm a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here! We have watched Joe learn to ice skate in Dancing on Ice and Stacey declutter homes in Sort Your Life Out.",
      "But now the couple are going one step further and allowing viewers inside Pickle Cottage, their family home in Essex, in a new reality series for BBC One.",
      "It is a fly-on-the-wall series - and Stacey says she only realised in the thick of the filming that viewers can see everything, \"and then you panic a bit\", she tells the BBC.",
      "But ultimately, they are just a normal family \"doing our best in every aspect of our lives\", she says.",
      "\"So in the end, you sort of relax with that, and you think, 'Oh well, so they saw us get the hump with each other, or they saw us do something wrong'.",
      "\"That is probably the best thing we could show the world, because everything isn't perfect.\"",
      "There was no point in doing a reality show, says Joe, if they were not going to be honest.",
      "\"We don't want to glamourise anything,\" says Joe. \"Our biggest discussions at the beginning of this were, 'how much are people going to want to watch us take the kids to school and change nappies?' Our lives are not that exciting.\"",
      "Joe, 43, a former EastEnders actor, and Stacey, 35, a former X Factor contestant, met on the set of I'm a Celebrity in 2010 and have been in a relationship since 2016.",
      "They married in 2022 and are raising five children - Zach, Leighton, Rex, Rose and Belle - aged between 17 and two, alongside two dogs and four ducks.",
      "\"When I met Joe, my older children [Zach and Leighton] were four and seven,\" says Stacey, \"so they were little.\"",
      "When people say it is nice to see a blended family, she says she forgets that is what they are. \"To be honest, we're just a family.\"",
      "Joe says he struggles sometimes with the words - blended family, stepdad and stepsons.",
      "\"I love [Zach and Leighton] as much as I love all my other kids,\" he says. \"There's no distinction.\"",
      "When it comes to childcare, the couple do not have a nanny or au pair, but they do have a very supportive family.",
      "\"We've got Dave - my dad - and my sister,\" says Stacey. \"And I always say this, we live like a Kibbutz. We basically all chip in with each other.\"",
      "As well as juggling family and work, viewers will get to see all aspects of Stacey and Joe's lives, which, like any relationship, can include the odd disagreement.",
      "\"We want to show that we love each other, but sometimes we kill each other,\" says Joe. \"It's all part of it, and other couples do the same, so they'll relate to that.\"",
      "Stacey says she found being able to watch back and reflect on a situation quite helpful as she could see it from an outsider's point of view, which she believes is healthy for a relationship.",
      "Viewers will also get to see the love and support Stacey and Joe give each other. Joe describes Stacey as extremely loyal, like a \"mother lion\".",
      "\"Don't go near her cubs, she'll have you,\" he says.",
      "\"She's just the most wonderful person,\" he says. \"She's kind, she's loving. I mean there's nothing about Stacey I would change. People love her in the streets and, imagine me, I'm so lucky, I get to spend the rest of my life with her.\"",
      "Joe has the ability to give everyone a bit of himself, says Stacey, which is \"so magic\" and he has the most incredible amount of empathy, she says.",
      "Their parenting styles, on the other hand, are \"polar opposite\" she says.",
      "\"I'm aware that Stacey takes a lot of the brunt because I let [the children] do something and she's the one that has to say, 'No, you can't do that',\" says Joe. \"So she has to play bad cop quite a lot of the time, which I am aware of, but I just don't know any other way.\"",
      "Stacey believes this stems from the fact that Joe lost his father when he was very young.",
      "\"I think that when that happens to you in your life, obviously you just want to be\u2026 fun, happy. You don't want to create any negative memories,\" she says.",
      "For their family, having young children and teenagers growing up together has created something really magical.",
      "Stacey says the teenage boys can revert to being younger again which is important because they grow up so quickly in the modern world. They have the chance to still play, with the excuse being \"oh, I'm only doing it because it's with my little brother or little sister\", she says.",
      "It also gives the older boys a massive sense of responsibility, she adds.",
      "Raising five children requires military-style organisation, says Stacey, something she learnt after having her first son at the age of 17.",
      "\"I, quite frankly, was probably the most scatty teenager you've ever known,\" says Stacey. \"When I had Zachary, I had this one whole life that I was responsible for, and so many things that I had to do that I'd never had to consider.\"",
      "She says she would get a giro - a welfare cheque - to cash in at a certain time on a Thursday at the Post Office, and she realised she could not be late as she needed the money for groceries.",
      "Stacey relied on Zach and \"asked a lot of him\", she says, needing him to help her.",
      "\"I haven't done that with the younger ones, because I've had Joe,\" she says, \"and that's just the reality of my situation. It's been different through the years.\"",
      "But Zach, now 17 himself, is \"probably one of the most empathetic, caring, emotionally intelligent young teenagers that I know,\" says Stacey.",
      "\"I feel like that has a lot to do with how we grew up together, and how life was for us in the beginning.\"",
      "Having more children is not currently on Stacey's radar, she says, as her body is still recovering from having three children in five years.",
      "\"My pelvic floor is dying,\" she laughs. Although Joe would love to have more.",
      "Stacey still has plans to increase their brood - but this time it is their animals.",
      "\"I literally walked into a conversation the other day and I heard 'cow',\" says Joe, \"and I was like, 'No way, we can't have a cow'.\"",
      "\"We were just throwing a few ideas around,\" says Stacey. \"I would love to have animals and make our own milk and collect our own eggs and grow our own vegetables.",
      "\"That's a dream of mine - but in the future. At the moment, we're still rearing children.\"",
      "Stacey & Joe starts on Tuesday 1 April at 20:00 BST on BBC One and BBC iPlayer."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq309kexeo",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 12:33:21 GMT",
    "summary": "NewJeans talk to the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label.",
    "story": [
      "\"It took a huge amount of courage to speak out,\" NewJeans have told the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label, in a case that has rocked the K-pop industry.",
      "\"This fight is necessary. Although it will be extremely difficult and arduous, we will keep doing what we have done so far and speak up,\" said Haerin, one of the members of the five-piece.",
      "\"We thought it was important to tell the world about what we've been through. All the choices we've made so far have been the best choices we could have made.\"",
      "NewJeans looked invincible in the charts when they launched what was an unusual rebellion in the high-pressure, tightly-controlled world of K-pop. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji stunned South Korea and fans everywhere with their decision in November to split from Ador, the label that launched them.",
      "They alleged mistreatment, workplace harassment and an attempt to \"undermine their careers\", which Ador denies. It sued to enforce their seven-year contract, which is set to expire in 2029, and sought an injunction against any commercial activities by the group.",
      "On Friday, a South Korean court granted it, ordering NewJeans to stop all \"independent\" activities, including song releases and advertising deals, while the case was still under way. NewJeans has since challenged the injunction in court.",
      "Friday's ruling was a \"shock\", the group told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people think that we're famous enough to do whatever we want and say whatever we please. But the truth is, it's not like that at all,\" Hyein said. \"We held it in for a long time, and only now have we finally spoken up about what we think, what we feel and the unfairness we've experienced.\"",
      "The K-pop industry has repeatedly come under fire for the pressure it puts on its stars not only to perform and succeed, but to appear perfect. But rarely do conflicts spill into the public, exposing stars' grievances and rifts with their labels.",
      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",
      "\"I was stunned,\" Minji says. So were the others when she told them. \"At first I thought I didn't hear her properly,\" Danielle says. \"We were all kind of in shock.\"",
      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",
      "\"It wasn't any easy decision to make,\" Hyein said on stage, as each of them took turns to address their fans. \"But at the moment for us, it's about protecting ourselves, so that we can come back stronger.\"",
      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

    "summary": "Robbie asked the group to join his stadium tour, after he discovered their music on BBC Radio 2.",
    "story": [
      "Thom Rylance, frontman of indie band The Lottery Winners, has experienced panic attacks since he was a child. But he'd never had one on stage... until last month.",
      "\"I've got this other, outgoing version of me that does the shows, and he just turns up every time,\" the singer explains.",
      "\"I don't really know him, and I think he's brilliant and quite handsome, but when we played Bournemouth, he just didn't come.\"",
      "The panic manifested as \"a tremendous sense of overwhelming dread\", he says, accompanied by sudden shortness of breath and a racing heartbeat.",
      "He isn't sure how, but he survived the gig without anyone noticing.",
      "YouTube footage shows him goading people into singing Reef's Place Your Hands, and taking selfies with fans during the encore.",
      "In his head, though, it was a disaster.",
      "\"I came off stage and I was really apologetic. I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I was awful. I couldn't speak'.",
      "\"And everyone was like, 'What you talking about? It was absolutely fine.'\"",
      "The reaction wasn't entirely unexpected. At the age of 35, Rylance has become adept at masking his anxiety.",
      "It's a topic he addresses frequently (and movingly) on the band's new album, KOKO, whose title is an acronym for \"Keep on keeping on\".",
      "The singer learned the phrase from his grandmother, who used it to comfort him when he was excluded from school.",
      "\"I didn't want to be bad or naughty, but there was something in me [that meant] I couldn't sit through the lessons,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I was expelled and taken away from all my friends, and it made me really sad \u2013 but my gran used to say, 'Keep on keeping on, Thom', and it stuck with me.\"",
      "'Where was my support?'",
      "The singer was belatedly diagnosed with ADHD two years ago, and the sense of relief hit him like a tidal wave.",
      "\"It was like a release of guilt,\" he says. \"Like, nothing I've ever done has ever been my fault!",
      "\"But it also came with a mourning period, where I was looking back and going, 'Where was my support? I didn't have to be a sad child'.",
      "\"I literally remember a teacher saying, 'If you don't do well in your GCSEs then your life is over.' That sent me spiralling because I was like, 'I don't want to be a junkie', you know?",
      "\"So, I've been going into schools recently and talking to kids with ADHD, just to show them that someone who did terribly in education can wake up every day excited and happy and ready for work.\"",
      "Rylance is speaking from Paris, where The Lottery Winners are wrapping up their latest tour.",
      "The band, completed by Robert Lally, Katie Lloyd and Joe Singleton, have been working tirelessly since they formed in Leigh, Greater Manchester, in 2008 \u2013 but success has been a slow grind.",
      "They signed their first record contract with Sire Records in 2016 after boss Seymour Stein (the man responsible for discovering Madonna) called them \"the best band since The Smiths\".",
      "But when he left the label the following year, the group went with him, delaying  their debut album by years.",
      "It finally arrived on British indie label Modern Sky in 2020, a week before the country went into lockdown, making promotion impossible.",
      "Even so, the band's buoyant indie pop songs and engaging online presence (Rylance is one of the funniest and likeable musicians on social media) helped them build a dedicated fanbase.",
      "By 2023, that support was support enough to send their third album, Anxiety Replacement Therapy, to number one, beating releases by The National and Jessie Ware.",
      "For Rylance, who spent his childhood \"feeling like an alien\", it was a huge deal.",
      "\"It's literally a trophy with a number one on it,\" he laughs. \"What bigger symbol of affirmation is there than that?\"",
      "How about being personally invited on tour by Robbie Williams?",
      "That's what happened last October. Robbie heard the band's single You Again on BBC Radio 2 and instantly booked them as his support act this summer.",
      "\"It was a really huge moment for me,\" says Rylance, who made his first public performance singing Williams' song Stronger on a school trip.",
      "\"Robbie's been a huge part of my life, so when he told me, 'I've listened to all of your albums', I was just like, 'What do you mean, Robbie Williams? Why are you saying that to me?'\"",
      "The pair subsequently struck up a firm friendship, and talk almost daily.",
      "\"Robbie's like my therapist,\" says Rylance. \"He's got ADHD as well, so he can relate to the things that overwhelm me.",
      "\"And I can literally ask him anything. I'll be like, 'Robert, how long do I put this pizza in the oven?'\"",
      "But Williams isn't the only famous name in his contacts.",
      "The Lottery Winners have recorded singles with Shaun Ryder, Nickelback and Boy George (\"a mild hit in Greece,\" laughs Rylance), while Noel Gallagher struck up a friendship with Rylance after playing with him last year.",
      "\"These people have always seemed so unreachable,\" he marvels. \"Noel Gallagher is not even... He's barely even a human being!",
      "\"So to have him right there in my phone... I've texted him for advice loads of times.\"",
      "That guiding hand proved crucial last November, when Rylance published an ill-advised tweet criticising musician Kate Nash's campaign to save the live music industry.",
      "He accused Nash of posing as a working class musician, pointing out she'd attended the Brit School - which he mistakenly thought was a private, fee-paying establishment.",
      "\"I wasn't very proud of that, and it ended up in the NME,\" says Rylance. \"They kept contacting me, asking me for a statement, and so I texted Noel, 'What should I do about this, mate?'",
      "\"He was like, 'Just tell them to speak to your new PR officer: Me.",
      "\"'I'll tell them you're too busy being mega to talk to the press.'\"",
      "In the end, Rylance took a different approach, apologising for his comments and offering to work with Nash, but Gallagher's support helped him keep a level head in a tricky moment.",
      "Today, he's still passionate about highlighting the issues around working class access to the arts.",

      "There are two elements - a daily living component and a mobility component. Claimants may be eligible for one or both.",
      "Under the government's proposals, assessments for the daily living part will be tightened, which the official forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - says will affect around 800,000 people.",
      "Pip assessments involve questions about tasks like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed. Each is scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional.",
      "From November 2026, the government says people will need to score at least four points for one activity, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of tasks.",
      "For example, needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.",

      "At present, the payment is made for a fixed period of time between one and 10 years, after which it is reviewed. You may be reassessed sooner if your circumstances change.",

      "At present, more than three million recipients have no requirement to find work due to their health, a number that has risen sharply.",
      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen for the same period.",
      "At the same time, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise. When the government first set out its plans, it said it would rise to \u00a3107 a week by 2029-30, but the Spring Statement confirmed it would go up to \u00a3106.",

      "730,000 future UC recipients who will lose an average of \u00a33,000 per year.",
      "However, these calculations don't take into account the effects of the extra \u00a31bn the government it says it will spend to help those with disabilities and long-term health conditions find work.",
      "It expects this support will mitigate some of the predicted financial losses.",
      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",

      "He has just had an ultrasound scan at an NHS centre which sits between familiar High Street names. It is easy-to-reach healthcare - as convenient as popping out to the shops.",
      "This is part of the government's vision for the future of the NHS, soon to be set out in a 10-year plan. In England, ministers have already promised three big changes: shifting more services from hospitals into the community, focusing on preventing ill-health and making more use of new technology.",
      "BBC Panorama spent months in South Yorkshire meeting people already changing how they work, to see what it will take to fix a health service which is buckling under increasing demand.",
      "The NHS also has to cut waiting times, money is tight and the organisation which currently runs it, NHS England, is being scrapped to reduce bureaucracy.",
      "There is another deep-rooted problem - a care system, supporting older and disabled people in the community, that is understaffed, underfunded and in crisis.",
      "Government critics say you cannot reform the NHS unless you reform social care, because it helps get people out of hospital more quickly and prevents some being admitted in the first place.",
      "An independent commission will begin looking at social care reform next month. There will be an interim report, but the final report is not due until 2028.",
      "Challenged on whether you can reform the NHS without changing social care, Health and Social Care Secretary, Wes Streeting tells Panorama that he doesn't need to wait for a review and plans to divert more NHS money into social care.",
      "\"I want to spend more of our resources through social care, because it delivers better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers,\" he says.",
      "Streeting would not be drawn on how much money would be involved, but said details about spending on social care would be in the 10-year NHS plan.",
      "Most care is paid for by councils, or by the people who need it. It can end up costing some families tens of thousands of pounds. Only those with the very highest needs get help from the NHS.",
      "Future of the NHS",
      "At Barnsley Hospital it used to take about six weeks to get a non-urgent scan, but at the town's NHS centre next to the shops most people are seen in two weeks.",
      "The centre's new scanners and X-ray machines have increased the number of patients staff can see and freed up the hospital so it can concentrate on emergencies and inpatients.",
      "Phil had skin cancer removed four weeks ago from his chin and the consultant wanted to check a couple of pea-sized lumps in his stomach. The scan results will be sent to his GP.",
      "\"It's about peace of mind. You're not waiting for appointments,\" he says.",
      "Liz Elfleet, medical imaging manager at Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust who helped set up the unit, describes this as the future of the NHS.",
      "\"We've seen around a 50% reduction in patients not attending for appointments,\" and the number of women accepting an invitation to have a routine breast screening appointment has risen \"from 43% to just under 80% over the three years,\" she says.",
      "The centre, which offers a range of health checks and scans, was opened in 2022 under the last Conservative government. The current Labour government says many more services will now move out of hospital into the community.",
      "In Barnsley, that is already happening. Part of another shopping centre is being converted into a second, large health hub. The project will be funded by the local council, regional mayor and a government grant.",
      "The leader of Labour-run Barnsley Council, Sir Steve Houghton, says the scanning centre has shown NHS facilities can boost town centres, and they estimate people spend about \u00a317 on average in local businesses when they visit.",
      "Preventing ill-health",
      "The second big shift the NHS is being asked to make is to focus more on preventing ill-health. In Sheffield, a GP practice has already begun to do this, to help them manage a workload which they say had become overwhelming.",
      "Five years ago, Steel City General Practice analysed the data for 10,000 of their patients who needed the most help. \"So we then said, let's actually proactively bring them in. They haven't contacted us - we've contacted them,\" says Dr Krishna Kasaraneni.",
      "GP appointments usually take about 10 minutes, but the Steel City practice gave these patients longer appointments to try to pick up problems earlier. They also took a risk and didn't chase a national target to see all patients within two weeks.",
      "Dr Kasaraneni says it has paid off. \"The numbers of strokes have dropped over that five-year period. Coronary heart disease numbers have dropped,\" he says. It has helped the doctors manage their workload better.",
      "The improved health of the patients has freed up some appointments, and on average people don't wait longer to see someone, but the growing older population means they are still very busy.",
      "While GPs will be crucial to the government's 10-year plan, there are not enough of them. Taking into account those working part-time, the equivalent number of fully qualified, full-time GPs is lower now than it was a decade ago - despite a rising population.",
      "Better use of technology",
      "The third of the big NHS changes is better use of new technology. At Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, they are using AI to speed up the comparison of heart scans.",
      "Before, a radiographer would take about half an hour to manually plot different points around a 3D image of the heart and identify any changes from a scan carried out six months earlier. Now AI tackles it in just a couple of minutes.",
      "Prof Andy Swift, who developed the AI tool with colleagues from the hospital and Sheffield University, says it has been used on 10,000 cases in the past few years. He says it is saving about 30 minutes each time.",
      "\"In the time that we've saved, we've managed to scan more patients and also do more reports for patients,\" he says.",
      "Despite these innovations, change on the scale the government promises is difficult in an NHS struggling to cope with growing demand.",
      "Solving the problems of the NHS also requires tackling the difficulties of social care, which supports around a million older and disabled people in the community.",
      "In February, NHS England figures showed around 14,000 people could not leave hospital, partly because of a lack of home and residential care. More social care can also reduce falls and illnesses.",
      "'We keep pressure off NHS'",
      "The family of Martin - who is 41 and is autistic, with cerebral palsy and epilepsy - say Sheffield care worker Darren Leigh has become like a brother to him over 20 years. Darren knows when Martin is unwell and can quickly get the right help.",
      "\"We keep pressure off the NHS a lot of the time,\" he says. \"There are [also] people in hospital that need to come out but can't because they can't get the care they need.\"",
      "The care system has struggled with underfunding, staff shortages and increasing demand for years. Like many care firms, the not-for-profit company Darren works for says it is \"on a bit of a knife-edge\" as the government is also increasing the costs of employing people. Employer's National Insurance and the National Minimum Wage will go up in April.",
      "The government says it will give councils in England nearly \u00a3900m more for adult and children's social care over the next year. Across the UK, there will be increased support for family carers and a fair pay agreement for staff is being introduced.",
      "Speaking to Panorama, Streeting says social care has a \"big part to play in terms of shifting care out of hospital into the community\". He adds: \"I'm convinced that we can spend NHS resources more effectively through social care.\"",
      "The main opposition parties in England agree social care needs to be reformed.",
      "But the Conservatives say the government has no real plan.",
      "The Liberal Democrats say the NHS cannot be fixed without fixing social care. Reform UK wants to simplify social care through a single funding stream.",
      "And the Green Party is calling for free social care.",
      "There are also questions over whether the NHS has the money to make all the changes the government is promising.",
      "It had a budget of \u00a3171bn in the financial year 2023-2024. It was also given an additional \u00a321bn over two years. NHS Providers, representing trusts across England, says most of that money has been eaten up by everyday pressures including wage rises, inflation and drug price increases.",
      "It warns these competing pressures make the change needed more difficult.",
      "The health and social care secretary agrees that it will not be easy, but says he cannot \"keep on pouring ever-increasing amounts of taxpayers' money into a system that is not set up to deliver best use of that money and best care for patients\"."

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 02:46:42 GMT",
    "summary": "An inquest into the death of Ida Lock has shone light on repeat mistakes - and wider failures in certain hospitals across England",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Michael read this article",
      "By the entrance to Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness sits a sculpture of a moon with 11 stars. It is a memorial to the mother and babies who died unnecessarily due to poor care at the hospital between 2004 and 2013.",
      "Inscribed underneath is a short verse: \"Forever in our hearts; Forever held in the love that brought you here; Our star in the night sky, spring blossom, summer rose, falling leaf, winter frost; Forever in our hearts.\"",
      "When the memorial was unveiled in 2019, Aaron Cummins who is chief executive at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: \"We will never forget what happened.  We owe it to those who died to continually improve in everything that we do.\"",
      "Barely a month later, Sarah Robinson stepped into a birthing pool at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, a hospital run by the same NHS trust. She was about to give birth to her second child.",
      "Within an hour, Ida Lock was born; within a week, she was dead.",
      "What her parents were put through on that day \u2013 and in the years since \u2013 goes a long way to explaining why maternity services in England have failed so many families.",
      "The inquest into Ida Lock's death, which concluded last week, exposed over five weeks why maternity services across England have long struggled to improve - and this one case holds a mirror to issues that appear to be prevalent across a number of trusts.",
      "'I thought I'd done something wrong'",
      "The memorial the trust erected at Furness General Hospital followed a damning inquiry into the trust's maternity services.",
      "That investigation, carried out by Dr Bill Kirkup and published in March 2015, found there had been a dysfunctional culture at Furness General, substandard clinical skills, poor risk assessments and a grossly deficient response to adverse incidents with a repeated failure to properly investigate cases and learn lessons.",
      "Morecambe Bay became a byword for poor maternity care and the trust promised to enact all 18 recommendations from the Kirkup review. And yet that never happened.",
      "\"We wouldn't be in this situation now if they'd followed those recommendations,\" says Ms Robinson.",
      "Ida Lock's inquest began last month, more than five years after she died - the delay was down to several reasons, including its particular complexity.",
      "What emerged was just how profoundly many of those lessons had not been learned. Particularly egregious, says Ms Robinson, was a suggestion from a midwife \u2013 shortly after the birth - that Ida's poor condition was linked to her smoking, something Sarah had never done in her life.",
      "\"The amount of days I cried because I thought I'd done something wrong... every Christmas, every holiday, you always have this heavy weight that you shouldn't be having fun. And all along, some people knew.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the staff who had delivered Ida were told in an email that \"they had demonstrated excellent teamwork, and had all worked in the best interests of mum and baby\".",
      "As the coroner found on Friday, Ida's death was wholly avoidable, caused by a failure to recognise that she was in distress prior to her birth, and then a botched resuscitation attempt after she was born.",
      "By the time she was transferred to a higher dependency unit, at the Royal Preston hospital, she had suffered a brain injury from which she could not recover.",
      "Having failed to deliver their daughter safely, Ida's parents would have expected that the trust would properly and openly investigate her death. Instead, they pursued an investigation that Carey Galbraith, the midwife who completed it, would later describe as \"not worth the paper it was written on\".",
      "They didn't take responsibility for their failings despite having an independent report from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) \u2013 a body that examined questionable maternity care \u2013 clearly stating their shortcomings.",
      "\"Our efforts to get any answers have been met with a complete block,\" said Ida's father, Ryan Lock. \"Particular people have told us to our face something that wasn't the case, that Ida was poorly before she was born, and that's the reason why that this happened.\"",
      "Clearly, the Morecambe Bay report was not, as was hoped, a line in the sand for maternity services across England, or a rallying cry for widespread improvements. As the inquest has shown, it did not even lead to sustained improvement at Morecambe Bay.",
      "Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer at the trust, said in a statement last week that it has made improvements since.",
      "\"We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest. We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.\"",
      "'A woeful picture' nationwide",
      "Elsewhere around the country, other trusts have also been forced to face their failures, often by grieving families.",
      "In March 2022, an investigation into services at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust found that more than 200 mothers and babies could have survived with better care. Then, in October that year, a review into maternity services at East Kent Hospitals University NHS trust found that at least 45 babies might have survived if they had been given proper treatment.",
      "And an ongoing review into the maternity care provided by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust, due to be completed next year, is set to be the biggest yet, with around 2,500 cases being examined.",
      "Even that does not tell the full story. Families in several areas, including Sussex, Leeds and Oxford, want local investigations into their maternity services. And an annual review of units by inspectors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) paints a woeful picture.",
      "In the commission's latest report, published in September, not a single one of the 131 units inspected received the top rating, Outstanding, for providing safe care.",
      "About a third (35%) were rated as Good for safety, around half (47%) were rated as Requires Improvement while almost a fifth (18%) were deemed Inadequate, the lowest grading.",
      "\"While we identified pockets of excellent practice,\" wrote the CQC, \"we are concerned that too many women and babies are not receiving the high-quality maternity care they deserve.\"",
      "Professor James Walker, who used to be the clinical director for HSIB, said that from his visits around England, the problem was that maternity units \"didn't have the skills, the finances, or the drive to actually make the changes that are required.\"",
      "Ida Lock's inquest was a case in point. What emerged over the inquiry was that the midwife delivering Ida was not compliant with crucial training in heart-rate monitoring, that staff did not know how to investigate incidents or realise they should inform external regulators of an unexpected death.",
      "\"It's deeply distressing,\" says Dr Kirkup. \"It's bad enough that other trusts didn't listen, but for it to happen again in this same trust is unforgivable.\"",
      "From poor culture to lack of teamwork",
      "Listening to his exasperation brought me back to the autumn of 2022. On that bright morning, Dr Kirkup was speaking at the publication of his inquiry into maternity care in East Kent.",
      "Many of the failures he'd found there \u2013 poor culture, lack of teamworking, not listening to families, a failure to investigate incidents or learn from them \u2013 were a repetition of what he'd uncovered at Morecambe Bay seven years earlier.",
      "He struggled to hide his frustration that here he was again, forced once more to explain to families why they had been failed by a trust that did not know how to do the right thing.",
      "Like Morecambe Bay, East Kent deteriorated even after his 2022 inquiry. Within months of the publication, inspectors became so concerned about its services that they considered closing maternity care at one of its hospitals, the William Harvey in Ashford.",
      "The CQC found that staff were not carrying out basic tasks such as washing their hands in between patients, or wearing gloves and aprons when delivering care, and that they were leaving urine and bloodstains in toilets.",
      "The inspection highlighted how little the East Kent review had changed things where it mattered, front-line in the wards.",
      "As the report had said, \"there are deep-seated and longstanding problems of organisational culture\" in the trust's maternity units, including \"disgraceful behaviour and flawed teamworking that were previously left to fester\".",
      "In October 2024, the board of East Kent Hospitals Trust said that it apologised unreservedly for the pain and loss, and for the failures of the board.",
      "It said: \"We are on a journey to fundamentally transform the way we work. Changing the culture of a large and complex organisation takes time and there is much work still to do, but we are determined to succeed so that we are providing the right standard of care and compassion.\"",
      "Derek Richford, whose grandson Harry had died in avoidable circumstances in 2017 at East Kent, is now working with the trust to improve maternity care and argues that it is an uphill struggle. \"It's been a devil of a job,\" he claims, \"to get people in the trust to simply read the report, even the summary.\"",
      "Should medics be punished?",
      "The question asked by some families is why heads haven't rolled. There is a widespread recognition in healthcare that punishing medics for individual clinical errors does not necessarily lead to safer outcomes.",
      "It can in some cases promote a defensive culture, where people do not own up to their mistakes and lead to individuals being blamed rather than supported to improve.",
      "The day after the Shrewsbury maternity report was published, the then-Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department would \"go after the people responsible.",
      "\"I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,\" he added.",
      "Three years later, there is no evidence of anybody being held to account.",
      "The Department of Health says it is \"unable to comment on individual staffing responsibility while an active police investigation is taking place\".",
      "\u00a31.15bn of maternity-related payouts",
      "Even when major reviews into maternity care have led to families getting individual feedback and told they had been failed, any subsequent legal action leads to NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, requiring that the case is examined afresh. This can add further delays and costs to the process.",
      "NHS Resolution said that inquiries \"do not look at cases from a legal liability perspective. Failings by a clinician might amount to errors of judgement, but that is not necessarily sufficient to constitute negligence under the law\".",
      "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "In 2023-24, NHS Resolution paid out \u00a31.15bn for maternity-related deaths and injuries, 41% of its total payments, despite maternity care forming a much smaller proportion of a trust's daily activities.",
      "\"NHS resolution is this anonymous body,\" says Derek Richford, \"that you can't get a name of the person you want to speak to. You can't get any accountability. And those people are the puppeteers for the people below who have to run around doing their will. It's wrong.\"",
      "'The time for inquiries is over'",
      "There are now calls for the government to establish a national maternity inquiry, rather than relying on individual ones at different hospitals and trusts. More than 36,000 people have signed up to one such petition, led by two sets of bereaved parents; while campaign group Maternity Safety Alliance is making a similar call. So far, the Department of Health hasn't committed to a national inquiry.",
      "Both Dr Kirkup and Prof Walker argue that the time for inquiries is over.",
      "\"Another inquiry will find exactly the same things that we find at the moment,\" said Prof Walker, \"we know what the problems are.\"",
      "What is needed is a national plan to improve maternity care, argues Dr Kirkup. He says he has been working with the Department of Health on drawing up plans to improve teamworking and providing compassionate care.",
      "Streeting has said he will \"fix our maternity services\", including supporting trusts to make rapid improvements and training more midwives, but has not detailed how he intends to go about this. \"I just wish that the Secretary of State would announce his intentions,\" says Dr Kirkup.",
      "Prof Walker also believes that a national programme of improvement and oversight should be launched, taking the learning from individual investigations and ensuring it is embedded across the system. For it to be truly effective, he argues, it will require a specific type of leadership.",
      "\"The NHS traditionally doesn't appoint leaders,\" he says, \"it appoints managers, people who come in and take the status quo that's there, and just make sure that it gets more efficient. That doesn't make it better, or innovate or improve.",
      "\"One of my frustrations over the years, working in various places, is I kept being told 'we don't do that'. And I kept on saying, 'why don't we do that?' The simple questions are always the best ones, because they challenge the status quo.\"",
      "Prof Walker highlights that there has been some progress in recent years, however. The latest figures on Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (the successor body to HSIB) show that the number of incidents of both potential and severe brain injuries have decreased.",
      "Back in East Kent, Mr Richford has observed some changes too. \"We have a new board of directors that appear to be doing the right thing \u2013 they're certainly saying the right thing,\" he says.",
      "\"[But] even now, seven years on [from Harry's death], it's still not as it should be. We are still trying to make sure that the trust is being as transparent as they say they are.\"",
      "As for Ida Lock's parents, the road on which their daughter would have grown up leads directly to Morecambe Bay, and a small patch of sand. This is where they scattered some of her ashes. Now they refer to it as Ida's beach. When they pass by, with their two other children, they regularly blow her a kiss across the sand.",
      "Their fervent hope is that other couples do not experience a similar fate. But they know that long before them, other families also suffered - and they aren't confident that more won't in the future.",
      "\"Those families went through what we're going through now,\" says Sarah. \"But nothing came of it. You can't trust that [improvements] are ever going to happen.",
      "\"I hope something does change.\"",

      "The government will not get close to the extra homes needed to hit its housing target in England, official figures suggest.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's plan for 1.5 million new homes by 2029 is seen as crucial to solving the housing crisis and boosting economic growth.",
      "But latest estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggest the government will fall short of that figure, even with planning reforms outlined in chancellor Rachel Reeves's Spring Statement on Wednesday.",
      "A government spokesperson said further reforms not reflected in the OBR's forecast would help to reach the 1.5 million target.",
      "The Home Builders Federation said the government \"urgently needs\" to make mortgages more accessible to first time buyers to meet the target.",
      "Rachel Reeves singled out the government's efforts to build more homes as a major success of the Labour government in her Spring Statement.",
      "She highlighted OBR figures that showed housebuilding was set to hit a 40-year-high and boost the economy by \u00a36.8bn.",
      "The chancellor claimed that reforms to the planning system would enable the government to get very close to achieving the 1.5 million target.",
      "But despite the chancellor's optimistic outlook, the figures actually suggest that planning reforms are on course to achieve far fewer new homes than first hoped.",
      "The central plank of those reforms are ambitious mandatory targets for every local authority, to grant more planning permissions.",
      "Reeves said the government would get to within \"touching distance\" of its 1.5m target, telling MPs that 1.3 million new homes would be created by 2029.",
      "However, the 1.3 million figure she used includes housebuilding in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "In fact, only 1 million new homes are expected to be built in England, it's understood.",
      "OBR figures also make clear that many of those homes would have been built anyway, regardless of the government's planning reforms.",
      "The watchdog says reforms introduced by Angela Rayner will only lead to an extra 170,000 homes in England, a quarter of the amount needed to hit her target.",
      "Ministers have been keen to point to the economic boost that those 170,000 new homes will achieve.",
      "Last year saw a record low for housing projects granted planning permission in England, with just over 30,000 projects given the go-ahead.",
      "The chief executive of the Home Builders Federation, Neil Jefferson, told the BBC the government needs to address \"other barriers\" to \"reverse the declines we have seen in supply and deliver much needed housing\".",
      "He said the planning changes were \"very positive but further interventions are urgently needed if we are to increase housebuilding to the level required\".",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"The OBR forecast only factors in reforms to the National Planning Policy Framework in England which is just one element of this government's efforts to increase housebuilding.",
      "\"Further reforms such as the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, the government's long term housing strategy and the new Affordable Homes Programme are not reflected in the forecast and will all help to reach the 1.5 million target.\"",

      "The UK government is trying to negotiate exemptions from a wide range of US import levies due to come into force at midnight on 3 April.",
      "But some car companies believe it is now too late to delay the measure, and instead want to discuss support options.",

      "There was also no indication that an agreement could be reached with the US on tariffs before the introduction next week, one source said.",
      "US tariffs could have a huge impact on the UK economy, with the government's official forecaster estimating that in a worst case scenario taxes could reduce economic growth by 1% and wipe out Chancellor Rachel Reeves's \u00a39.9bn headroom against her debt rules.",
      "Government sources said there is \"still all to play for\" in negotiations over 25% tariffs placed on car imports into the US ahead of next week.",

      "Jones said \"there is no easy answer\" and there are \"complicated issues\" to be discussed.",
      "While the government said it was \"disappointed\" by the decision to impose tariffs on cars, it said the US was \"an indispensable ally\" and Britain was taking a \"pragmatic\" approach to import taxes.",

      "Ineos Automotive, a start-up carmaker, told the BBC the tariffs are a \"significant threat\" since the US is its biggest market and its manufacturing is based in the European Union (EU).",
      "Ineos chief executive Lynn Calder said she was \"hugely frustrated\" that EU politicians had \"sat on their hands\" and \"not come to the negotiating table\" with Trump.",

      "The industry is likely to ask for a support package from the UK government to manage the disruption.",
      "The government is already consulting on changing the mandate for zero electric vehicles, which could end up costing UK manufacturers and subsidising importers such as Tesla, which is controlled by key Trump ally Elon Musk.",
      "The mandate sets out the percentage of new zero emission cars and vans that manufacturers will be required to sell each year up to 2030.",
      "Reeves has told the BBC that Tesla gets some money from the ZEV mandate.",
      "Any tweak to it could help UK exporters but disadvantage Tesla, which specifically wrote to the new government last July to ask them not to change it.",
      "Only a handful of ministers and officials know the content of the UK's talks with the US administration, which are believed to be about the whole package of tariffs, not just the car sector.",

      "The figure, released by the Department for Work and Pensions, is an increase of 100,000 children from the previous year - and equates to 31% of children in the UK.",
      "The figure has risen sharply since 2021 and the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) predicts 4.8 million children will be in poverty by the end of this Parliament in 2029-30.",

      "He added: \"We're going to be addressing that\".",

      "One in five families who had one child were living in poverty, compared with 44% of those who had three children or more.",
      "The Resolution Foundation echoed calls for the government to scrap the two-child benefit limit and wants the government to extend free school meal entitlement to all families on Universal Credit.",

    "summary": "Alex Mayer MP is calling for a return to \"Churchill Time\" where clocks are set two hours ahead.",
    "story": [
      "For many who dislike dark winter nights, this weekend will be one to savour as the clocks spring forward by an hour on Sunday 30 March from 01:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).",
      "This marks the end for some and the gloom that can be caused by GMT, and the start of British Summer Time (BST) and lighter evenings.",
      "However, the Labour MP for Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard, Alex Mayer, has called for a \"major overhaul of time\" and a conversation about \"how best to use our nation's daylight hours\" in a parliamentary debate.",
      "But why do the clocks go back and forward in the UK each year?",
      "The process of moving the clocks forward by one hour in the summer was started during World War One in Germany in 1916, as a way to save energy resources during lighter evenings.",
      "Weeks later other countries followed suit, including the UK, where it was named British Summer Time. During World War Two in 1941, the then-prime minister Sir Winston Churchill introduced a system where clocks were advanced by two hours.",
      "This meant that during winter, while clocks went back an hour they were still one hour ahead of GMT to increase productivity during daylight.",
      "This ended in 1945, but briefly returned two years later due to severe fuel shortages that summer.",
      "What did the debate involve?",
      "Mayer wants a return to how things were in World War Two and hosted an adjournment debate in Parliament on the subject.",
      "She argued that a return to what is known as \"Churchill Time\" could help save a combined \u00a3485m in yearly electricity bills - and reduce carbon emissions by more than 400,000 tonnes.",
      "She called this \"a low-cost, high-impact proposal\" to \"help meet climate goals, reduce energy bills, and boost our High Streets by making better use of the daylight hours we already have\".",
      "Responding for the government, Business Minister Justin Madders said despite public debate about changing the clocks, the government was not going to introduce double summer time.",
      "Mayer is not the first MP to bring this discussion to Westminster.",
      "In 2012, a bid by Conservative MP Rebecca Harris to move UK clocks forward by an hour for a three-year trial period failed after the legislation ran out of time in the House of Commons.",
      "In 1968, there was a three-year experiment to keep BST in place throughout the year. On average, there was a huge reduction in road casualties, but this has since been attributed to new drink-driving legislation in 1967.",
      "What are the arguments against the change?",
      "During that experiment in northern Scotland, there was a net increase in the number of people killed or seriously injured on the roads, because during the darkest days of December sunrise would not take place until 10:00.",
      "In 2012, when MPs voted against it, many objections focused on the impact of a change on road accidents.",
      "Critics argued it would make the lives of outdoor workers harder and increase road accidents due to the darker mornings - although those in favour of a change argue it would reduce evening accidents.",
      "Other sources have expressed concerns about the negative impact of extended daylight evenings to health and sleep patterns.",
      "Recent studies suggested modern power consumption habits mean energy savings made by reducing evening lighting were now offset by increased energy consumption, in the warmer lighter evenings.",

      "However, the former UKIP leader later obtained a report from the bank which indicated his political views were also considered.",
      "NatWest's chief executive Dame Alison resigned in July 2023 after admitting she had made a mistake in speaking about Mr Farage's relationship with the bank.",
      "A public debate also followed over people being having their bank accounts shut due to their views. Farage said he was later refused personal and business accounts at seven more banks in the UK.",

      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",
      "That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.",

    "summary": "The UK's economic prospects are better than expected, but the forecasts are precarious and could easily be derailed.",
    "story": [
      "The story of this Spring Statement is that welfare has been cut back to make up for a notable rise in the cost of servicing the national debt. There is also a trim to the money being given to government departments.",
      "There is relatively little else actually happening in policy terms. There were no tax rises, no changes to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' borrowing rules and as expected, this was definitely not a Budget.",
      "The real question now is whether the chancellor can escape from a never-ending cycle of microhaggling with the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in this way, twice a year for the rest of the Parliament.",
      "When asked about whether new tax rises could now come in the Autumn like last year, she said emphatically: \"We'll never have to do a Budget like that again.\"",
      "But the numbers are precarious and extremely sensitive to the economic and political changes around the world.",
      "If the US imposes 20% tariffs on the UK next week, it could lead to a downgrade in UK growth and \"wipe out\" the \u00a39.9bn headroom the chancellor has to meet her borrowing rule, the OBR chairman, Richard Hughes, told me.",
      "Other uncertainties include higher interest rates and lower UK productivity, he said, adding that \"the risks are very elevated\".",
      "That is why growth, confidence, and comprehensive economic strategy is so important.",
      "By June there should be new plans for trade, industry and infrastructure. In the next few weeks, there could be an economic deal with the US, and the start of a Brexit reset with the EU.",
      "Despite the uncertainties, the OBR's judgement on the economy was better than had been expected. This year's growth was downgraded, but close to normal levels of growth are predicted to return in later years.",

      "It's a policy that doesn't involve taxes or spending yet is expected to provide a huge boost to growth.",
      "At this stage this is not about an extra brick being laid or even planning approval, but it is a \"spreadsheet win\" that eased the chancellor's fiscal pain.",

      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen for the same period.",

      "It expects this support will mitigate some of the predicted financial losses.",
      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",

      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",

    "story": [
      "Talk of growth forecasts and self-imposed financial rules may feel very distant from you and your life, but the Spring Statement could affect both your job and your money.",
      "Here's what it could mean for you.",
      "1. Benefit changes",
      "If you are on benefits, you could be directly affected.",
      "The changes to the benefits system, announced last week, will see some people lose support from next year, although universal credit payments are set to rise from next April.",
      "This means:",
      "If you claim Personal Independence Payments and do not qualify when the criteria are tightened, then you are likely to be hardest hit. Some 370,000 people are expected to lose their entitlement altogether, and others will receive less than they expected. The average loss is \u00a34,500 a yearEven if you are not affected by the Pip changes, you may still lose out. Overall, by 2029-30, some 3.2 million families - some current recipients and some future recipients - will see cuts, with an average loss of \u00a31,720 per year once inflation is taken into accountIf you are on universal credit, then you could benefit. A total of 3.8 million current and future claimants will be \u00a3420 a year better off on average by 2029-30, after taking into account the impact of inflation",

      "Other changes to the welfare reforms also mean less money than you may have expected.",
      "For example, the government had said there would be a rise in the standard allowance for universal credit for 6.5 million people.",
      "It will now rise to \u00a3106 a week, for a single claimant aged over 25 in 2029-30, rather than the \u00a3107 previously billed.",
      "The health element of universal credit, which is paid if your ability to work is limited,  was set be halved for new claimants to \u00a350 a week in 2026-27, and will now be frozen thereafter.",
      "Ministers have said that existing claimants will be affected too with their entitlement frozen at \u00a397 a week until 2029-30.",
      "2. Living standards and household bills",
      "The Spring Statement doesn't come in isolation. Next week, a series of household bills will rise.",
      "From 1 April, you will pay more for water, energy and your council tax.",
      "However, if you're over 21 and on the minimum wage then your hourly rate will go up to \u00a312.21 an hour, from the current \u00a311.44.",
      "Nonetheless, the rising cost of living has pushed many of you to your financial limit.",
      "And now the prices you pay are expected to rise at a faster pace this year than previously thought.",
      "Inflation - is expected to average 3.2% this year, according to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, before falling to 2.1% in 2026 and then 2% from 2027. The government's target is 2%.",
      "As a result,  interest rates, which are used to try and control the rate of rising prices, are expected to remain higher than previously thought.",
      "Overall, however, living standards are expected to improve.",
      "This is measured by real household disposable income which is expected to rise by just over 2% between now and 2030. That means on average you are expected to be \u00a3500 a year better off by 2030. However, this is relatively small by historical standards.",
      "Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change.",
      "There's likely to be more speculation about the future of tax-free allowances in Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). The government says it is \"looking at options for reforms\" to encourage investing money.",
      "3. Jobs and services cut or created",
      "Forecasts about the general state of the economy will also influence the decisions the chancellor chooses to make and this could directly affect you.",
      "For example, official forecasts about economic growth this year have been halved from 2% to 1%, but are higher in subsequent years owing, in part, to the government's housebuilding programme.",

      "A spending review in June will outline how much each government department has to spend, but the Treasury now has a better idea of how much it has to work with.",
      "This could lead to job cuts and, for example, any cuts to local government funding could increase the cost of services you use, such as garden waste bins or parking.",
      "On the flipside, investment by the government - such as with defence projects - could create new jobs."

    "story": [
      "\"The world has changed\" is the mantra we are hearing from the government.",
      "It is a phrase designed to explain and justify the chancellor's argument on Wednesday in what is known as her Spring Statement.",
      "The Conservatives are branding it an \"emergency Budget\", which ministers insist is nonsense, but it is certainly true it is a bigger event than it was expected to be just a few months ago.",
      "We won't see Rachel Reeves standing on the steps of 11 Downing Street waving a red box around and it will be shadow chancellor Mel Stride responding to her in the House of Commons, rather than the leader of the opposition as happens on Budget Day.",
      "But other elements of the day will have a Budget day feel, not least in the overall vibe of whether Parliament and the country feel confidence in the government's economic prospectus.",
      "The backdrop is pretty bleak.",
      "When Labour won last year's general election, they said the first of their \"missions\" was to \"kickstart economic growth\".",
      "The thing is, there isn't any - the economy is flatlining.",
      "Plus, inflation is up and government borrowing costs are up.",
      "Then there are the big-picture challenges: the UK has an ageing population, the benefits bill is going skywards, the dangerous international picture is demanding more money for defence and the country is saddled with huge debt, which attracts huge debt interest payments.",
      "Add to that the wild unpredictability of US President Donald Trump, the looming prospect of tariffs and the vast uncertainty over Ukraine's future and European security.",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "All of which prompts the question: if the world really has changed, how much appetite now or in the future might Labour have for a really far-reaching re-examination of how it approaches government?",
      "With big and potentially unpalatable trade-offs looming, what alternatives could there be?",
      "There are loads of ideas it could explore, from the left, the right and everywhere in between. But let's take a look at a few, all floated publicly by some on their own side.",
      "What is the chancellor's Spring Statement and what will be in it?",
      "Loosen the fiscal rules?",
      "At the heart of the political conversation this week are the government's self- imposed \"fiscal rules\".",
      "The government has chosen them in the hope they illustrate financial responsibility,  a trustworthiness on the international stage that the UK can pay its way and service its debts.",
      "The two rules are that day-to-day costs are met by tax revenues and that debt is falling as a share of the economy five years ahead.",
      "They are, ultimately, arbitrary: managing the national finances is complex and multilayered and while governments will often impose limits on themselves in the hope of portraying credibility, precisely what they are can vary significantly.",
      "Former Labour cabinet minister Lord David Blunkett told the BBC at the weekend he \"would like the Chancellor to loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", adding that they amounted to \"Treasury orthodoxy\u2026at its worst\".",
      "\"I would lift them marginally. I would raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15 billion and I would spend a great chunk of it on what we did back in '97 with the new deal for the unemployed,\" the former work and pensions secretary told BBC Radio 4.",
      "Lord Blunkett isn't the only one \u2013 Jagjit Chadha, Professor of Economics at Cambridge University, has written in The Guardian this week of his scepticism about the value of the fiscal rules.",
      "There is another parallel that could be drawn too.",
      "Last week the German parliament voted to allow a massive increase in defence spending.",
      "The new law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules.",
      "Could, should, the UK do the same?",
      "Both the German parallel and Lord Blunkett's suggestion get short shrift from senior government figures.",
      "\"When people say change the fiscal rules, that means borrowing more money,\" is how one source put it to me.",
      "\"We have got to be honest about the implications of higher borrowing. If we did what Germany is doing, it could add \u00a34bn to borrowing costs, not far off the prisons budget,\" they added.",
      "It is also pointed out that Germany's national debt is vastly smaller than the UK's as a share of national income.",
      "And there is no appetite to do anything that might provoke the international markets to go wobbly about the UK again, as happened when Liz Truss was prime minister.",
      "What about a wealth tax?",
      "Some on the left of the Labour Party have been calling for this, as have the Green Party and others.",
      "The idea would attempt to do what it said on the tin, but observers such as Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies are cautious about its likely effectiveness as a revenue raiser.",
      "Before the last Budget in the autumn a cross-party group of MPs suggested it, while Labour MP Richard Burgon raised it as an idea at Prime Minister's Questions earlier this month.",
      "Reeves has long distanced herself from the idea, arguing in 2023: \"I don't see the way to prosperity as being through taxation.\"",
      "Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are fearful of being portrayed as high taxers and high spenders, an image plenty within Labour think has previously cost them dearly at elections.",
      "But could a one-off such tax ever be tempting as ministers confront awkward spending squeezes in places and that ever growing demand for defence spending?",
      "Other taxes rises in spotlight",
      "What about cranking up income tax, national insurance or VAT?",
      "After all, these are the big levers of revenue raising for any chancellor.",
      "But there is a catch: Labour promised not to in its election manifesto.",
      "They did, nonetheless, put up national insurance, albeit on employers not employees \u2013 a rise that is due to kick in next month and is causing considerable anxiety for many businesses.",
      "So why not ratchet up one of the others?",
      "Some say, for a start, it could further depress an already stagnant economy, as well as further depress the outlook of many on politicians' capacities to keep promises.",
      "On the other hand, increases to these taxes tend to lead to a reliable big uptick in tax revenue and because they reach significant swathes of the population, they don't energise smaller, often well organised sectors who can then vociferously oppose a more targeted and less revenue rich idea.",
      "A good example of this are the dozens of tractors on Whitehall as farmers in their thousands made their views known about changes to inheritance tax.",
      "Thinking about all this was hinted at, alongside changes to the fiscal rules, by the now former international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, in her resignation last month over the cut in the international aid budget to bolster defence spending.",
      "In her resignation letter to the prime minister, she wrote that she had hoped the government would \"collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, just as other nations are doing\".",
      "She added: \"It will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, where strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\"",
      "Smashing manifesto promises is not something governments do lightly and Labour would tread particularly carefully around these flagship pledges on the economy, so often for many a perceived weak spot in the party's credibility.",
      "The tax burden, on average, is also generationally high \u2013 another reason these ideas could be a mighty hard sell even if ministers were willing to break their promises.",
      "And if ideas from their own side, like these three, aren't palatable, all of which make an already big State even bigger, there are those suggested by the Conservatives and others.",
      "Reducing benefit spending",
      "Cutting benefits much more is one such idea.",
      "The former Conservative and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, writing in the Telegraph, suggested closing eight government departments, saving \u00a324bn by cutting the public sector workforce and instituting a two year public sector pay freeze.",
      "He reckoned these ideas alongside others could cut government spending from 45% of national income to 40%.",
      "Many of these might not be instantly palatable to a Labour government, just like those from their own side, but all of this brings us back to where we began: has the world changed? By how much? For how long?",
      "And just how bold might the government have to think \u2013 and soon \u2013 if it really has?",

      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",
      "When Reeves begins her statement at the despatch box, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this \"changed world\".",

      "Everything you need to know about the Spring Statement",
      "'As a student, \u00a3800 a month is quite tight'",
      "What are Rachel Reeves's borrowing rules?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

    "summary": "Sewage spilled into England's waterways for a record number of hours last year, the Environmental Agency says.",
    "story": [
      "Water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours last year, a slight increase on 2023.",
      "The data released by Environment Agency on Thursday showed that although the number of spills was down each spill lasted longer on average - resulting in a higher total number of hours.",
      "Some spilling can be legal, but concern has been mounting amongst scientists about the harm that regular sewage spilling is causing the country's aquatic life.",
      "Water UK, the industry body, said sewage spills are a \"disgrace\" but has committed to a programme of investment worth \u00a3104bn over the next five years.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "Water company makes case for higher bill increases",
      "\"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.",
      "His views were echoed by Water UK Chief Executive David Henderson: \"Any sewage flowing into waterways is a disgrace. Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"",
      "England, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.",
      "This practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.",
      "Water companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.",
      "Sewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023.",
      "CEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"",
      "In 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".",
      "Sewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.",
      "The River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.",
      "Of the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"",
      "Liberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.",
      "\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.",
      "In October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.",
      "An Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"",
      "The Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.",
      "These upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.",
      "Prof Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"",
      "Ofwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.",
      "Phillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".",
      "He said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "It is this second solution that is preferable for the environment, he said, but it requires coordination between government, planning officers and housing developers \u2013 and takes longer to implement.",
      "\"A lot of this work is not as easy as it might seem from the outside in reality.",
      "\"I think it would be preferable for me to go a bit slower, get it right. But politically there's an awful lot of pressure to fix things now, and I do worry about the next 5 years,\" he said.",

      "Operators of the 225-year-old Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal have warned of an \"urgent\" water shortage without the prospect of imminent rainfall.",
      "It comes amid debate over how the historic attraction should secure its water supply in future after limits were placed on taking water from the environmentally sensitive River Usk.",

      "\"Everything the canal supports is at threat - we risk losing the jewel in the crown of south Wales,\" said Tracey Leake-Jones, who runs the Bridge 46 to Five Locks canal group.",
      "Made up of volunteers, the group runs events along the canal and has fundraised to install planters, benches and signs.",
      "The prospect of it having to close due to water shortages was \"utterly devastating\", she said.",
      "\"There has to be a solution found, and my view is that the Welsh government and its leaders are the only people who can bring all the main players together.\"",
      "She pointed to new housing estates being built along the canal with the waterway used as a marketing tool, and said the local council hoped to be able to open up further stretches down to Cwmbran, describing the economic benefits as \"unimaginable\".",
      "\"Should we have problems with water supply then what's going to happen to those plans for restoration that we've all been working on for the past three years?\"",
      "News broke of the difficulties facing the canal in a letter sent to local businesses by Gland\u0175r Cymru, the Canal and River Trust in Wales, in February.",
      "It explained the canal, which once transported iron and coal to Newport docks, had relied on funnelling water from the River Usk and its tributaries which accounted for 80-90% of its water supply.",
      "Recent changes in legislation, designed in part to protect rivers in the face of climate change, means licences are now required, restricting the amount of water that can be taken.",
      "Last year, Gland\u0175r Cymru lost an appeal against some of the conditions stipulated by environmental regulator Natural Resources Wales (NRW).",
      "The River Usk is a designated special area of conservation protected by law due to its importance for rare wildlife including the Atlantic salmon, which is threatened with extinction from Wales.",
      "\"The canal took around 30% of the total flow of the river in 2022 - which was the last dry year period,\" said Gail Davies-Walsh, chief executive of Afonydd Cymru which represents river groups across Wales.",
      "Limits on abstraction were needed to ensure the species and habitats had sufficient water to survive \"particularly during dry summers and low flow periods,\" she said.",
      "Mark Evans, director of Gland\u0175r Cymru, said the trust accepted it could no longer continue to abstract water from the Usk at the same level as it had in the past.",
      "But recent dry weather highlighted the urgency of finding an alternative supply, he said.",
      "\"The amount of water we can take is starting to really concern us,\" he explained.",
      "\"It's urgent today, looking at the forecast for the next week.",
      "\"At some point we'll have to stop the boats from using the locks,\" he warned, adding that both the canal's users and its wildlife would be impacted as levels fell.",
      "Discussions have been taking place in recent weeks with Welsh Water over whether it could help to support the canal during periods of prolonged dry weather.",
      "But this would come with \"financial implications\" and the potential of having to pay commercial rates for the water, resulting in a considerable bill the charity could not afford, he claimed.",
      "Alasdair Kirkpatrick, owner of Beacon Park Boats, said he had already received phone calls from customers who had booked boat trips asking about the impact on them.",
      "\"I never saw this one coming,\" he said, \"it has really shocked us all.\"",
      "\"All my customers nip down to the local pubs and restaurants, 25% of them fly in from overseas from places like America and Australia, using local taxis and train services and spending a fortune locally,\" he added.",
      "He urged the Welsh government \"to fund Welsh Water to continue to maintain water levels and keep all the operators of this canal in business - it cannot be lost\".",
      "Gavin Bown from Natural Resources Wales said regulating water abstraction was \"a complex, evidence-based process that carefully balances environmental needs with those of local communities\".",
      "\"Our priority is to protect the integrity of the River Usk and the Severn Estuary, both designated as special areas of conservation,\" he explained, adding the regulator would continue to work collaboratively with the Canal and River Trust.",
      "A Welsh Water spokesman said the River Usk was \"one of the primary sources of drinking water to around 250,000 customers across south east Wales\".",
      "But it remained \"one of our least drought-resilient supply areas\", with limited water resources to deal with the impacts of climate change and population growth.",
      "\"We have proposed in the driest of years to supply some customers with water from the River Tawe through an emergency pumping station and use this spare capacity in abstraction from the River Usk to support the canal,\" he explained.",
      "However this would come at a cost, with discussions ongoing over whether this would be affordable to the trust.",
      "\"To provide this free of charge or risk the future supply of drinking water to our customers, isn't an option for us,\" he said.",
      "The Welsh government said \"protecting and enhancing our environment and natural resources is key to addressing the climate and nature emergencies\".",
      "\"The limits placed on the licences were in line with the amounts applied for by the Canal & River Trust,\" a spokesperson said.",

      "A rare new species of two-clawed dinosaur has been discovered by scientists in Mongolia's Gobi Desert.",
      "The species, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, was unique within a group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which stood on their hind legs and usually had three claws.",
      "It was medium-sized, with an estimated weight of approximately 260kg.",
      "Researchers believe the species' long, curved claws and its ability to strongly flex them would have made it an efficient grasper of vegetation.",
      "Therizinosaurs were a group of either herbivorous or omnivorous theropod dinosaurs that lived in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous Period, which began 145 million years ago and ended 66 million years ago.",
      "They are exemplified by the massive, long-clawed form Therizinosaurus, featured in the film Jurassic World Dominion, and were \"awkward looking\", according to one of the study's authors Dr Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor at the University of Calgary.",

      "Unesco, the UN's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, calls the Mongolian Gobi Desert the largest dinosaur fossil reservoir in the world.",
      "The region is an especially important source of fossils from the later Cretaceous period, which is the last of the main three periods of the dinosaur age, representing the final phase of dinosaur evolution.",
      "At nearly a foot long, the claws themselves were much larger than their underlying bone, the study revealed.",
      "Besides better grasping, the two-fingered hands may have been used for display, digging, or as formidable weapons.",
      "The most famous two-fingered theropods are species within the group tyrannosaurids, which includes Tyrannosaurus rex, but Duonychus evolved its two-fingered hands separately from them and from other two-fingered theropods.",
      "The specimen also preserves the first keratinous sheath of a therizinosaur, an element that covers the claw much like human fingernails, aiding defence, movement, or prey catching."

      "Archaeologists have helped uncover one of the \"largest and most important\" Iron Age finds in the UK.",
      "The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University.",
      "It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians believe the \"unprecedented\" find could lead to a \"major re-evaluation\" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time.",
      "After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a \u00a3120,000 grant from Historic England.",
      "Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth.",
      "Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was \"exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe\".",
      "He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought.",
      "\"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,\" he said.",
      "\"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\"",
      "It is thought the objects may have been burnt on a funerary pyre before being buried, though no human remains were found.",
      "Analysis: Danny Savage, BBC News",
      "In the archaeology labs at Durham University there's a real buzz about the unveiling of the Melsonby Hoard. Curators feel this is the discovery of a lifetime.",
      "Hundreds of recovered artefacts are spread out in a climate controlled room on long tables.",
      "You have to use your imagination a bit, Iron Age artefacts from 2,000 years ago have rusted or faded and are far from their original glory.  Some of them were decorated with coral which has bleached over the centuries.",

      "This will keep experts busy for years.",
      "There's also a bit of secrecy too. The exact location of the discovery is not being revealed over concern that rogue treasure hunters will turn up at night and start looking for other artefacts.",
      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",
      "Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.",
      "The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage.",
      "Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK.",

    "story": [
      "Brent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor.",
      "In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka.",
      "Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one.",
      "\"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve.",
      "But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say.",
      "It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives.",
      "Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events.",
      "For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Dr Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code.",
      "\"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\"",
      "With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning.",
      "The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows.",
      "The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction.",
      "It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur.",
      "Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Dr Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare.",
      "The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region.",
      "While the guess was correct, Dr Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy.",
      "There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Dr Jones said.",
      "The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet.",
      "Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\".",
      "The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come.",
      "Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis.",
      "While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region.",
      "Dr Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them.",
      "\"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\"",
      "Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska, Japan or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade.",

      "At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030.",
      "While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur.",
      "\"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\"",
      "This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Dr Jones said.",
      "\"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said.",

      "But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said.",
      "Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out.",
      "It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Dr Jones.",
      "During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute.",
      "The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries.",

      "The computer systems of 23andMe have been struggling to cope with the sheer volume of customers racing to delete their data, after the DNA-testing company announced that it was filing for bankruptcy protection.",
      "The firm says it has now resolved the IT problems caused by increased traffic on its website at the start of the week.",
      "But users have reported ongoing difficulties as they scrambled to protect their genetic information, health histories, and ancestry details.",
      "A number of those who have successfully removed their data have also told the BBC of their ongoing anxieties about 23andMe's future.",
      "The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday in order to sell itself through a court-supervised process.",
      "\"If 23andMe is going to be sold, then my data can be sold, from what I hear,\" said 52 year old Danielle Landriscina of Maryland. Ms Landriscina signed up for 23andMe in 2018 to connect with members of her father's side of the family.",
      "\"What's stopping something like a health insurance company from buying my data and then using it to determine if I get health insurance or how much I have to pay for it?,\" added Ms Landriscina, who works in tech sales.",
      "Surge in traffic",
      "For now, 23andMe \"will not voluntarily share your Personal Information\" with insurance companies, the company's current privacy statement says.",
      "But the future is less certain. 23andMe's proposed May 14 auction of its assets could include the genetic data of its millions of customers.",
      "To protect herself, Ms Landriscina said she tried multiple times to log into her 23andMe account starting on Tuesday morning, both on her phone and through a web browser.",
      "She was among the many customers asked to complete the login process by email using two-factor authentication to verify her identity.",
      "She said she didn't receive a verification code until the evening, and only saw it after a ten-minute window to use the code had expired.",
      "Earlier in the day, the company's online chat service advised her to try again later due to a surge in traffic to the website. It wasn't until Tuesday night that she was able to remove her account from the company's database.",
      "\"If anyone has any issues in regards to accessing their account or deleting their data, they can go to our customer care site for support,\" a 23andMe spokesperson said in reply to a BBC inquiry.",
      "The company did not reply to subsequent emails detailing the customer complaints the BBC learned about.",
      "Pauline Long of Alabama also said she made multiple attempts to access her account starting early on Tuesday morning.",
      "\"This has been a nightmare and I am now going to be more cautious about doing anything online,\" Ms Long told the BBC in an email.",
      "She said she waited for two hours to chat with a customer service agent. She was finally able to delete her account by Tuesday evening but expressed scepticism about whether the company had actually deleted her information.",
      "\"I am concerned that 23andMe will hold onto data,\" Ms Long said.",
      "Purge your information",
      "According to 23andMe, deleting an account and associated data will permanently delete the data associated with all profiles within the account.",
      "Attorneys General from multiple US states - including California, Arizona, South Carolina, and New York - have advised 23andMe customers to purge their information from the firm's database given the sensitivity of the material it has amassed during its years in operation.",
      "\"Every individual will have a different appetite for risk and will value their own private information differently,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta told the BBC by phone Monday.",
      "\"It's up to them what they do, but I wanted to advise them of their right to delete.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr Bonta issued a consumer alert offering users a step-by-step guide on what to do as signs of 23andMe's financial distress mounted.",
      "\"It's exactly a moment like this when a reminder of the rights and protections you have is appropriate, so you can determine if and how you want to exercise those rights,\" Mr Bonta said.",
      "DNA-testing site 23andMe to lay off 40% of its workers",
      "DNA firm holding highly sensitive data 'vanishes' without warning",
      "According to 23andMe, any buyer of the company will have to abide by laws that apply to how customer's data is treated, and any transaction will be subject to customary regulatory approvals.",
      "Customers who previously asked 23andMe to store a DNA sample can ask that it be destroyed.",
      "For users who opted into 23andMe's research programme, personal information will no longer be used in future research projects, the company said.",
      "23andMe's said it would continue to protect customer data as laid out in its privacy policy.",
      "But it acknowledged that if it was \"involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your Personal Information may be accessed, sold or transferred as part of that transaction.\"",

      "62-year old genealogist Michele Lewis of Georgia said she found the process of deleting her data more straightforward than another attempt she made a few months ago when she was subjected to a waiting period.",
      "\"It was much easier and it was deleted almost immediately,\" Ms Lewis told the BBC in an email Tuesday. \"I have never really been too worried about privacy issues or hacking or anything, but this isn't the first time 23andMe has had issues.\"",
      "In 2023, millions of 23andMe customer accounts were compromised in a massive data breach. The company reached a $30 million settlement stemming from the breach in September.",
      "Ms Lewis, who used a 23andMe test kit in 2008, said it wasn't hard to part with the company.",
      "\"I very rarely access 23andMe anymore anyways,\" she said.",
      "Some customers have said the experience offers a lesson.",
      "\"If I had to do it all over again, I would not have done this,\" said Ms Landriscina. \"The benefit does not outweigh what I think now is the harm of having my DNA out there having it possibly sold. It's very concerning.\""

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 09:51:03 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts say using even such a privacy-focussed platform for national security matters is very unusual.",
    "story": [
      "The messaging app Signal has made headlines after the White House confirmed it was used for a secret group chat between senior US officials.",
      "The editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to the group where plans for a strike against the Houthi group in Yemen were discussed.",
      "Signal's creator Matthew Rosenfeld - who is better known by the pseudonym Moxie Marlinspike - joked the \"great reasons\" to join the platform now included \"the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations\".",
      "But others are not seeing the funny side, with Democrat Senate leader Chuck Schumer calling it \"one of the most stunning\" military intelligence leaks in history and calling for an investigation.",
      "But what actually is Signal - and how secure or otherwise were the senior politicians' communications on it?",
      "The security app",
      "Signal has estimated 40-70 million monthly users - making it pretty tiny compared to the biggest messaging services, WhatsApp and Messenger, which count their customers in the billions.",
      "Where it does lead the way though is in security.",
      "At the core of that is end-to-end encryption (E2EE).",
      "Simply put, it means only the sender and the receiver can read messages - even Signal itself cannot access them.",
      "A number of other platforms also have E2EE -  including WhatsApp - but Signal's security features go beyond this.",
      "For example, the code that makes the app work is open source - meaning anybody can check it to make sure there are no vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.",
      "Its owners say it collects far less information from its users, and in particular does not store records of usernames, profile pictures, or the groups people are part of.",
      "There is also no need to dilute these features to make more money: Signal is owned by the Signal Foundation, a US-based non-profit, which relies on donations rather than ad revenue.",
      "\"Signal is the gold standard in private comms,\" said its boss Meredith Whittaker in a post on X after the US national security story became public.",
      "'Very, very unusual'",
      "That \"gold standard claim\" is what makes Signal appealing to cybersecurity experts and journalists, who often use the app.",
      "But even that level of security is considered insufficient for very high level conversations about extremely sensitive national security matters.",
      "That is because there is a largely unavoidable risk to communicating via a mobile phone: it is only as secure as the person that uses it.",
      "If someone gains access to your phone with Signal open - or if they learn your password - they'll be able to see your messages.",
      "And no app can prevent someone peeking over your shoulder if you are using your phone in a public space.",
      "Trump backs top adviser who accidentally added journalist to secret air strike chat",
      "Why is it a problem if Yemen strike plans shared on Signal?",
      "Data expert Caro Robson, who has worked with the US administration, said it was \"very, very unusual\" for high ranking security officials to communicate on a messaging platform like Signal.",
      "\"Usually you would use a very secure government system that is operated and owned by the government using very high levels of encryption,\" she said.",
      "She said this would typically mean devices kept in \"very secure government controlled locations\".",
      "The US government has historically used a sensitive compartmented information facility (Scif - pronounced \"skiff\") to discuss matters of national security.",
      "A Scif is an ultra-secure enclosed area in which personal electronic devices are not allowed.",
      "\"To even access this kind of classified information, you have to be in a particular room or building repeatedly swept for bugs or any listening devices,\" said Ms Robson.",
      "Scifs can be found in places ranging from military bases to the homes of officials.",
      "\"The whole system is massively encrypted and secured using the government's own highest standards of cryptography,\" she said.",
      "\"Especially when defence is involved.\"",
      "Encryption and records",
      "There's another issue tied to Signal that has raised concerns - disappearing messages.",
      "Signal, like many other messaging apps, allows its users to set messages to disappear after a set period of time.",
      "The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg said some of the messages in the Signal group he was added to disappeared after a week.",
      "This may violate laws around record-keeping - unless those using the app forwarded on their messages to an official government account.",
      "This is also far from the first row involving E2EE",
      "Various administrations have wanted to create a so-called backdoor into messaging services that use it so they can read messages they think might pose a national security threat.",
      "Apps including Signal and WhatsApp have previously fought attempts to create such a backdoor, saying it would eventually be used by bad actors.",
      "Signal threatened to pull the app from the UK in 2023 if it was undermined by lawmakers.",
      "This year, the UK government became embroiled in a significant row with Apple, which also uses E2EE to protect certain files in cloud storage.",
      "Apple ended up pulling the feature in the UK altogether after the government demanded access to data protected in this way by the tech giant.",
      "The legal case is ongoing.",
      "But, as this controversy shows, no level of security or legal protection matters if you simply share your confidential data with the wrong person.",

      "\"I can see down the road in the future a world where this technology could really, really make a difference for someone that has this or any paralysis,\" he said.",
      "But for Noland there is one caveat with his Neuralink chip - he agreed to be part of a study which installed it for six years, after which point the future is less clear.",

    "story": [
      "\"If you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox\": with that advice in an exclusive BBC interview, the hugely popular gaming platform's CEO Dave Baszucki ignited a fierce debate among parents.",
      "Mr Baszucki also stressed the company took protecting its users extremely seriously  and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on what is the UK's most popular gaming site for children aged eight to 12.",
      "Hundreds of people got in touch with the BBC after reading his comments: many said parents needed to take more responsibility, or highlighted how safe and enjoyable Roblox was for their children.",
      "Others painted a much darker picture - accusations of grooming, addiction and a company that failed to respond to their concerns.",
      "Here are some of their stories. The BBC has changed some names to protect the identities of young people.",
      "The boy 'addicted' to Roblox",
      "For Amir, from Leeds, Mr Baszucki's comments were \"ridiculous\", and the course of action he suggested was \"much easier said than done\".",
      "\"Roblox is ruining my son\", he told the BBC - and he feels powerless to stop it.",
      "A user since he was eight or nine, he says the 15-year-old is \"addicted\" and can now use the site for up to 14 hours a day.",
      "\"He is a single child and both parents are so busy working. I feel guilty we haven't been able to give him quality time. That's been robbed by Roblox,\" Amir told the BBC.",
      "The son's account is linked to the father's email address, and Amir has received \"hundreds\" of emails over the years from Roblox about the violation of the 'terms of use'.",
      "He says his son has been given temporary bans, but finds a way to play on - using multiple accounts and the accounts of others.",
      "Amir hopes he can reduce his son's time on the platform by \"playing cards, talking and watching YouTube together\" rather than forcing him off the platform completely.",
      "In response, Roblox highlighted to BBC News the screen time limit feature on the platform that gives parents the ability to restrict the amount of time children are allowed to spend on Roblox each day.",
      "'My nine-year-old girl was groomed on Roblox'",
      "Sally, from the north of Scotland, told the BBC she \"fully takes responsibility\" as a parent - but questioned whether Roblox was doing the same.",
      "She told the BBC her nine-year-old daughter was being groomed on Roblox and - despite reporting it to the platform - did not get a response, leaving her \"enraged\".",
      "The mother said last December her child was chatting to someone in a game where you can \"mimic real life\". This user coerced her child to role play \"marriage\". They told the girl they were touching themselves, and asked Sally's daughter to touch herself and take a photo.",
      "They offered Roblox's in-game currency in exchange for the picture. The child didn't do it, and told her mother days later.",
      "\"When she approached me, it was with a lot of tears, and feeling very, very shameful with what had happened. I assured my child that it's not their fault that they have done everything correct - to tell me.",
      "\"This is unacceptable for a platform that's advertised towards young children. It seems like the company isn't taking any responsibility and clearly their filters are not working.\"",
      "Sally said companies that created platforms should be liable for any issues with them, rather than telling its users \"'well, don't use it'.\"",
      "How can you keep your child safe online?",
      "Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down",
      "In his BBC interview, Mr Baszucki said building a \"trust and safety system\" had been an important part of Roblox ever since it launched.",
      "He added: \"We do, in the company, take the attitude that any bad - even one bad incident - is one too many.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "He said he remained confident in Roblox's safety tools and insisted the firm went above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "Roblox also says it analyses all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so - and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "It stressed to BBC News that users cannot share images with each other on the platform.",
      "Concerns about children being exposed to sexual content on Roblox have been aired before.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned on the platform from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players. Other parental controls were also introduced.",
      "'My daughter loves Roblox'",
      "Many people have also contacted the BBC to endorse what the Roblox CEO said.",
      "Kathryn Foley said she was \"impressed\" with Mr Baszuki's \"honesty\" in his interview, and highlighted ongoing conversations she has with her nine-year-old daughter, Helene, about the platform.",

      "\"I would say on the whole the Roblox experience has been a very positive one with Adopt Me being a very kind and safe place for her to have fun with her friends,\" Kathryn said.",
      "Meanwhile, Kirsty Solman spoke to the Jeremy Vine show on BBC Radio 2 about her 13-year-old son Kyle, who has ADHD, autism and severe anxiety.",
      "\"He really struggles with social interactions and small talk. Being on Roblox and other gaming platforms, he is then able to play with his classmates.",

      "A report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago.",
      "Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.",
      "Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.",
      "Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.",
      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",
      "Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.",
      "It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.",
      "He ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".",
      "Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.",
      "It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.",
      "\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".",
      "A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.",
      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",
      "Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.",
      "Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.",
      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",
      "\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' custodians.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.",
      "In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.",
      "One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.",
      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",
      "Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.",
      "He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.",
      "\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

    "summary": "The BBC correspondent was deported from Turkey this week after covering ongoing mass protests in the country.",
    "story": [
      "I had just sent my family a message saying how happy I was to be back in Turkey, where I used to live, and how it felt like coming home. Then, the phone in my hotel room rang.",
      "\"We have an urgent matter to discuss in person,\" the receptionist said. \"Could you come down?\"",
      "I arrived to find three plain-clothes policemen waiting for me. They asked me for my passport and led me away, trying to prevent my colleagues from filming.",
      "I had been in Istanbul for three days by then, covering the anti-government protests sparked by the arrest of the city's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu.",
      "I was taken first to the police headquarters and held for seven hours. Two colleagues were allowed to be present and lawyers could come in to talk. The atmosphere was generally cordial. Some of the police officers told me they didn't agree with what they said was a state decision. One hugged me and said he hoped for my freedom.",
      "At 9.30pm, I was moved to the foreigners' custody unit of the Istanbul police. There, the atmosphere hardened from a succession of chain-smoking officers, with whom I had to negotiate in my broken Turkish. I was fingerprinted and denied access to lawyers or any contact with the outside world.",
      "In the early hours of Thursday, I was presented with papers to say I was being deported for being \"a threat to public order\". When I asked for an explanation, they said it was a government decision.",
      "One police officer suggested he film me saying that I was leaving Turkey of my own accord, which could help me to return in the future and which he could show his bosses. I politely refused, suspecting it would be given to the government-controlled media to push their version of events.",
      "By 2.30am, I was being moved to a final location \u2013 the foreigners' custody department at the airport. I was put in a room with a few rows of hard chairs and told I could sleep there. Between police officers entering to brush their teeth, planes taking off and the morning call to prayer, no sleep came.",
      "Seventeen hours after my initial detention, I was driven to a waiting plane to board a one-way flight to London. That night, after the case was made public, sparking significant media coverage around the world, the Turkish government press office released a statement saying I had lacked the correct accreditation. At no point had they mentioned this during my detention and it seemed clear that it was an afterthought on their part to attempt to justify my case.",
      "I was never mistreated at any point during the ordeal. And I knew throughout that BBC management and the British Consulate in Istanbul were working hard to secure my release.",
      "So many others who have fallen foul of the Turkish authorities do not have such a safety net. When I lived there as the BBC Istanbul correspondent between 2014 and 2019, Turkey was the world's biggest jailer of journalists. The watchdog Reporters Without Borders ranks Turkey 158th of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index. Since these latest protests began, eleven journalists are among the two thousand or so people who have been detained.",
      "The latest unrest was sparked by the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival, whom opinion polls suggest could unseat the President in an election.",
      "But they have grown into something much wider: a clamour for democracy in a country sliding further into authoritarianism. The clampdown on the media is central to that trajectory, as the government has progressively crushed criticism or debate. I caught a glimpse of that first hand. It ended for me with sadness and sleeplessness. For others, it's been so much worse.",
      "Meanwhile, President Erdogan is digging in, dismissing the protests as \"street terrorism\". He's emboldened by the current international climate of having an ally in the White House and of Turkey's importance to everything from Ukraine to Syria.",
      "The question now is whether the country's biggest demonstrations in over a decade can sustain momentum or whether Turkey's long-time leader can simply brush this off. Those out on the street may be chanting \"enough\" \u2013 but they also know never to write off Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",

    "story": [
      "Dua Lipa has won the dismissal of a lawsuit that accused her of copying her hit single Levitating from two other songs.",
      "The star was sued in 2022 by songwriters L Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer, who accused her of plagiarising their 1979 disco track Wiggle and Giggle All Night and 1980's Don Diablo.",
      "On Thursday, US Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the songs only had generic similarities, including non-copyrightable musical elements that had also previously been used by Mozart, Gilbert and Sullivan, and the Bee Gees in their song Stayin' Alive.",
      "It is the second time that Lipa has won a plagiarism case over Levitating, which was a global hit in 2020.",
      "She was previously sued by Florida reggae band Artikal Sound System, who claimed Lipa ripped off the chorus for her song from their 2015 track Live Your Life.",
      "Their case was dropped in 2023 after a judge ruled there was no evidence that Lipa and her co-writers had \"access\" to the earlier song - a key requirement in any copyright lawsuit.",
      "However, she is still facing a third legal challenge over the song, from musician Bosko Kante - a featured artist on Levitating, who sang vocals through a talk box.",
      "He sued in 2023, saying his contribution had been used on remixes of the song without permission.",
      "Kante is seeking damages of at least $2m (\u00a31.5m) plus interest, as well as profits from the remixes, which he estimated as being at least $20m (\u00a315m).",
      "Brown and Linzer's case alleged that Lipa stole the opening melody of Levitating, where she sings: \"If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy and I can take you for a ride.\"",
      "They called the melody and phrasing a \"duplicate\" of their own songs.",
      "But Judge Failla wrote that the elements were too common to be protected by law.",
      "\"The court finds that a musical style, defined by plaintiffs as 'pop with a disco feel,' and a musical function, defined by plaintiffs to include 'entertainment and dancing,' cannot possibly be protectable,\" the judge wrote.",
      "\"To hold otherwise would be to completely foreclose the further development of music in that genre or for that purpose.\"",
      "By coincidence, the ruling came on the fifth anniversary of Levitating's release, initially as an album track on Lipa's award-winning album Future Nostalgia.",
      "In a statement to music industry publication Billboard, lawyers for Brown and Linzer said they \"respectfully disagreed\" with the decision and would file an appeal.",
      "The BBC has contacted Dua Lipa for a response."

      "Those who declined to attend included Israel's own president and the chief rabbi of the UK, Sir Ephraim Mirvis.",

      "\"Today,\" he said, \"we issue a similar warning. The fate of free societies is tied to the willingness to fight the scourge of antisemitism.\"",
      "But the inclusion at the event of representatives of European far-right parties, like France's National Rally, Spain's Vox and the Sweden Democrats, had proven controversial.",
      "The UK government's antisemitism advisor Lord Mann turned down his invitation, saying: \"There is nothing for the UK to learn about tackling antisemitism from some of these characters.\"",
      "Chief Rabbi Mirvis declined to participate \"having been made aware of the attendance of a number of far-right populist politicians\", his office said in a statement issued last week.",
      "Israel's President Isaac Herzog did not attend either. He hosted his own separate event with Jewish leaders instead in what was seen as a compromise.",
      "The conference was organised by Amichai Chikli, Israel's Diaspora Affairs Minister, and an outspoken member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party. Chikli has over the past several months courted ties with far-right parties across Europe.",

      "Among those at the conference whose presence had caused some consternation was National Rally President Jordan Bardella, whose party was originally founded by Jean-Marie Le Pen, a man accused of antisemitism and found guilty of Holocaust denial.",
      "Jean-Marie was expelled from the party - then called the National Front - in 2015 by his daughter Marine over his comments about the Holocaust being a \"detail\" of history. But since his death in January she has said she can't \"forgive herself\" for doing so.",
      "The 29-year-old Bardella - a rising star of the French right - spoke on stage where he acknowledged the \"eminent symbolic significance\" of his invitation to Israel.",
      "Whilst he did not explicitly reference his party's past, he made vows for its future under Marine Le Pen, who heads the group in parliament.",
      "\"I would like to tell you in all sincerity, through its positions, its proposals and its steadfastness in the face of this threat, the National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, is the best shield for the Jews of France,\" he said.",
      "\"Islamism is the totalitarianism of the 21st century,\" he warned. \"It threatens to destroy everything that is not like it,\" echoing a claim often made by his party that France is facing an \"Islamist  threat\".",
      "Bardella had earlier visited some of the places where Hamas carried out attacks on 7 October 2023, and Israel's Holocaust memorial institute Yad Vashem.",
      "The conference was also a reminder of how Israel sees itself under attack by parts of the international community. Panel discussions were held on topics including \"Addressing Anti-Israel Bias in International Institutions\", \"How Radical Islam Fuels Antisemitism in the West?\" and \"Double Standards, From the Battlefield to the ICC\".",
      "The ICC \u2013 International Criminal Court - has issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes against the Palestinians.",
      "The move caused outrage across Israel, which accused the ICC itself of being motivated by antisemitism."

    "summary": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will be seeking to fight off a resurgent opposition and win a second term.",
    "story": [
      "Australia will head to the polls for a federal election on 3 May, in what is predicted to be a tight race.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, whose Labor Party will be defending a small majority, announced the date from Parliament House on Friday.",
      "Opinion polls predict a slim margin between the country's two major parties, and the possibility either will have to work with independent MPs or minor parties - which combined won a record share of the vote at the last election - to form the next government.",
      "The campaign is expected to be dominated by cost-of-living issues, and Labor is fighting to avoid becoming the first single-term government to lose an election in almost a century.",
      "In a press conference on Friday morning, Albanese reiterated his pledge to address the cost of living - having already unveiled plans to provide more free healthcare, cut student debt and deliver small tax cuts. He argued that electing his rival Peter Dutton would be a step backwards for the country.",
      "\"It was always going to take more than three years to clean up 10 years of mess,\" he said, referring to the previous coalition government he defeated at the last election in 2022.",
      "Never has voters' choice been more important, or more clear, he said: \"This election is a choice between Labor's plan to keep building or Peter Dutton's promise to cut.\"",
      "Albanese said his campaign would be about \"hope and optimism,\" while Dutton's would be \"all about fear\".",
      "The leader of the Liberal-National coalition, however, has said the country cannot afford three more years of a Labor government.",

      "\"Because of Labor's bad decisions, Australians are doing it tough and they need help.\"",
      "He argued his party would \"get Australia back on track\" by reining in \"wasteful spending\", slimming down the public service, cutting immigration, and making fuel and energy cheaper.",
      "The Greens, which last election won a record number of seats, said Australians should vote for them to keep Labor accountable on issues like the environment and housing.",
      "\"Minority government is coming. And with the major parties' offering about as attractive as a dead fish, you can see why,\" leader Adam Bandt said.",
      "The affordability of housing and groceries is at the top of voters' minds, as well as access to healthcare, though concern about managing record immigration and reducing crime is increasing significantly. Climate action - the feature of the last election - remains important to many Australians too.",
      "Politics in Australia - where voting is compulsory for adults - is traditionally dominated by Labor and the Liberal-National coalition. Either party needs to win at least 76 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - where the prime minister sits - to form a majority government.",
      "One of the country's longest serving politicians, Albanese took power after long period of political instability, in which the country changed leader six times in only eight years.",
      "He promised unity and integrity and - after a campaign marked by anger over Australia's emissions reductions efforts - vowed to \"end the climate wars\".",
      "Albanese's government enshrined into law a boosted emissions cut target, and introduced a mechanism that acts as a carbon cap for the country's biggest emitters - though experts say more ambition is needed.",
      "However, Albanese's key goal of achieving constitutional recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and establishing a parliamentary advisory body for them, failed at a referendum in 2023.",
      "And he has come under pressure over global economic conditions which have exacerbated cost-of-living pain in Australia - and played a part in the downfall of several incumbent governments around the world in the past year.",
      "Last year, he came under fire after it emerged that he had bought a A$4.3m ($2.9m, \u00a32.2m) cliff-top home amid a national housing crisis.",

      "He built a reputation as a hard-line conservative best known for overseeing Australia's controversial policies on asylum seekers, and his role in the downfall of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.",
      "He has styled himself as a cultural warrior - opposing same sex marriage, diversity and inclusion initiatives and the Voice to Parliament referendum - but has in recent times tried to shake his tough public persona, which he says doesn't accurately reflect who he is."

      "He has been selected by his party as presidential candidate in the 2028 election.",
      "In a statement issued on Thursday, the BBC said: \"This morning (27 March) the Turkish authorities deported BBC News correspondent Mark Lowen from Istanbul, having taken him from his hotel the previous day and detained him for 17 hours.\"",
      "On Thursday morning, he was presented with a written notice that he was being deported for \"being a threat to public order,\" the statement said.",
      "Mark Lowen said: \"To be detained and deported from the country where I previously lived for five years and for which I have such affection has been extremely distressing. Press freedom and impartial reporting are fundamental to any democracy.\"",
      "The BBC's CEO of News Deborah Turness added: \"This is an extremely troubling incident and we will be making representations to the Turkish authorities.",
      "\"Mark is a very experienced correspondent with a deep knowledge of Turkey and no journalist should face this kind of treatment simply for doing their job. We will continue to report impartially and fairly on events in Turkey.\"",
      "The Turkey director of Human Rights Watch, Emma Sinclair-Webb, told the BBC she was shocked at the deportation of an international journalist.",
      "\"This sends a message to the rest of the international media that 'we will not tolerate you covering stories we don't want the world to see,'\" she said.",
      "Thousands of people across Turkey have turned out for protests which have so far seen more than 1,400 people detained.",
      "The protesters say Imamoglu's arrest is politically motivated, but the justice ministry insists on its judicial independence.",
      "President Erdogan has labelled the demonstrations \"evil\" and blamed the opposition for \"disturbing the peace\".",
      "Several journalists have also been arrested, including a photojournalist from French news agency Agence France Presse and several Turkish reporters. Many were reportedly released on Thursday morning.",
      "Nightly protests have stopped but Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), is planning a rally in Istanbul on Saturday.",

    "story": [
      "When Jeffrey Goldberg published a bombshell story outlining how some of the most senior US officials had mistakenly shared sensitive information with him, he obtained the biggest scoop of the year. The Atlantic editor also became the prime target for every senior Trump administration official in Washington.",
      "In the last couple of days, he's been called a \"loser\" and a \"sleazebag\" by President Donald Trump, as well as a liar and \"scum\" by US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, who appeared to have mistakenly added Goldberg to a group chat earlier this month.",
      "Before he became a political lightning rod, however, Goldberg watched on his phone as cabinet officials - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard - discussed the sensitive details, timings and targets of an upcoming military operation in Yemen. They did not seem to notice his presence.",
      "In an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, he told me it all began when he got a message on his phone, via the publicly available Signal messaging app, which allows users to send each other encrypted messages. It's popular among journalists and government officials. An account under Waltz's name had messaged him, which he assumed was a hoax.",
      "\"I wish there was a Le Carr\u00e9 quality here, you know,\" he said, referring to the late British spy novelist. \"But he asked me to talk. I said yes. And next thing I know, I'm in this very strange chat group with the national security leadership of the United States.\"",

      "As the fall-out of the episode has engulfed Washington, Waltz has taken responsibility for mistakenly adding Goldberg to the group chat, suggesting that he meant to invite somebody else.",
      "He has insisted that he has never met the editor, saying: \"I wouldn't know him if I bumped into him, if I saw him in a police lineup\".",

      "\"He can say obviously whatever he wants, but I'm not commenting on my relationship or non-relationship,\" Goldberg told me. \"As a reporter, I'm just not comfortable talking publicly about relationships that I may or may not have with people who are news makers.\"",
      "Still, one thing is clear: you must already have someone's contact information to reach them on Signal, and so Waltz had Goldberg's phone number. The top security adviser has said he has asked Elon Musk, tech billionaire and the White House's government efficiency czar, to investigate how the mistake happened - a move that was ridiculed by Goldberg.",

      "In his Monday Atlantic story - the first to report his access to the chat - Goldberg withheld the precise details that were shared around the bombing mission that attacked Houthi rebel targets in Yemen on 14 March. But Trump administration officials downplayed the report, calling him a liar and challenging his claims that classified information was shared.",
      "And so two days later, the magazine printed the full text messages, including several from Hegseth that included operational specifics. I asked him if that was a tough decision to make.",
      "\"Once Donald Trump said there was nothing to see here, essentially, and once Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe said there was no sensitive information, no classified information, et cetera - we felt like, hm, we disagree,\" he said. \"They're saying that, and we're the ones who have the texts, so maybe people should see them.\"",
      "There are text messages in the group chat - sent before the first wave of strikes - detailing exactly when F-18 fighter jets would take off, when the first bombs would drop on Houthi targets and when Tomahawk missiles were going be fired. Hegseth has pushed back, saying they were clearly not \"war plans\" and none of it was classified information.",
      "President Trump expressed his support for Hegseth on Wednesday, saying he was \"doing a great job\" and describing Goldberg as a \"sleazebag\". The White House has also attempted to argue that the information shared was not technically war planning.",
      "Goldberg did not appear swayed by their insults and claims.",
      "\"If Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, is texting me, telling me the attack was about to be launched on Yemen - telling me what kind of aircraft are going to be used, what kind of weapons are going to be used, and when the bombs are going to fall two hours after the text is received - that seems sensitive information, war-planning information to me,\" he said.",
      "This isn't the first time that the veteran editor has been on the receiving end of Trump's ire: in 2020 he published a piece in The Atlantic where senior military officials quoted Trump as having referred to fallen American soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers\", something the president and his administration have vigorously denied.",
      "I asked him how he felt about the vitriolic personal attacks against him, coming from the very highest levels of the government.",
      "\"This is their move. You never defend, just attack,\" Goldberg said. \"So I'm sitting there, minding my own business. They invite me into this Signal chat and now they're attacking me as a sleaze bag, I don't even get it.\"",
      "Trump has, so far, been defending his national security team and doesn't seem inclined to sack anyone over what he is calling a press \"witch-hunt\". But Goldberg says there's a widespread feeling in the White House that Waltz made a serious error, as well as deeper concern about how the incident is being handled.",
      "\"If you're a Air Force captain, currently working with the CIA and the State Department, and you mishandled sensitive information the way that they've obviously mishandled sensitive information? You'd be fired, you'd be prosecuted,\" Goldberg said.",
      "He said there is now some \"buzz\" among the ranks around the apparently differing accountability standards for leaders in the Trump administration.",
      "Goldberg didn't stick around in the chat for the fallout. He decided the responsible thing to do was to leave the group. Some journalists have expressed incredulity that he would voluntarily exit.",
      "But what happens next will play out in the White House and Congress, where Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have demanded an investigation.",
      "\"There's a part of me that would love to see what else is happening in there. But there's a lot of different issues here related to law and ethics and all kinds of other issues that I really can't go into, \" Goldberg said. \"Believe me when I say that I made that decision with good advice from various parties.\"",

      "Getting information out of Myanmar is difficult. Mobile lines in the affected areas have been patchy since the quake struck, but tens of thousands of people also live without electricity and there is limited access to the internet.

Zelensky had come to Paris to meet leaders and diplomats from 30 other countries who are working out what they can contribute to the \"coalition of the willing\", the group that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to organise to offer Ukraine security guarantees if there is a long-term ceasefire.",

      "The most significant demand was for a state-owned Russian bank to be readmitted to the Swift system for international payments. That would open a door back into mainstream global commerce for Russia.",
      "That decision does not depend on Trump, as Swift is based in Belgium.",
      "The European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman responded with a statement saying one of the \"main preconditions\" for lifting or amending sanctions on Russia was \"the end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine\".",
      "Even Trump, reluctant to criticise Putin, suggested that Russia might be \"dragging its feet\" in the negotiations with the US. It reminded him of his own business career.",
      "He told the US cable channel Newsmax that \"I've done it over the years\u2026 I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked Zelensky where the push for a ceasefire stood, given Russia's demands. He called for a resolute response from the Americans.",
      "\"If America is going to stand strong and not bend to the conditions of the Russians - we stand on our land.",
      "\"We are defending it; we have shown our resilience to everyone\u2026 And now it's very important that our partners would be resilient and strong, at least at the minimum, as we are.\"",
      "I asked whether he believed the Americans would, as he put it, stay strong.",
      "\"I hope so. I hope so. God bless they will. But we'll see.\"",
      "Zelensky has no choice about stating his faith in Trump's America, even though he must have grave doubts.",
      "Trump's decision to punish Ukraine by cutting off military intelligence about Russia missile launches had an immediate and deadly impact, and Zelensky had to work hard to get Trump to relent. He does not want it to happen again.",
      "He was open about why he had to try to stay close to Trump, even as the US president seemed to be prioritising the restoration of relations with Moscow as he repeated Russian propaganda points, not least the lie that Ukraine started the war.",
      "\"We needed to unblock the aid from the US. For us, the exchange of intelligence is very important.\"",
      "Witkoff falling for Moscow's 'narratives'",
      "That did not stop Zelensky rebuking comments made by Steve Witkoff, Trump's super envoy, a real estate billionaire turned diplomat who deals with the Middle East as well as the Russian-Ukraine war.",
      "In an interview last week with Tucker Carlson, a right-wing podcaster in the United States, Witkoff disparaged the drive by the UK's Starmer and France's Macron to create the \"coalition of the willing\" to support Ukraine.",
      "The American said it was a posture and pose, \"a simplistic desire\" to sound like Winston Churchill. His words fit squarely into what seems now to be a settled view in the Trump Administration that their erstwhile allies in Europe are a parasitical burden on the United States.",
      "What if Witkoff was right? Strip away the insults and recognise that Europe's richest nations have chosen, for decades, to spend most of their considerable wealth on matters they consider more pressing than their militaries.",
      "Zelensky said Witkoff and others in the Trump administration, had fallen for Russian propaganda.",
      "\"I think that Witkoff often quotes the Kremlin narratives\u2026 I can't be ungrateful to the Americans for everything they did, but they are often, unfortunately, under the influence of Russian narratives. And we cannot agree with these narratives.\"",
      "Zelensky suggested that Witkoff was better at his old job, developing real estate in Manhattan.",
      "\"He doesn't look like a military man. He doesn't look like a general, and he doesn't have such experience. As far as I know, he is very good at selling and buying real estate. And this is a little different.\"",
      "In it for 'long haul'",
      "President Zelensky, for a man who has lived with immense pressure since Russia's full scale invasion more than three years ago, was remarkably buoyant, clearly pleased by the reception he had in Paris and the efforts that President Macron and Prime Minister Starmer are making to rally European support and to persuade, even cajole,  Trump not to cut intelligence and military support to Ukraine.",
      "Zelensky seemed happy with his new strategy of agreeing to temporary ceasefires to force Putin to show his reluctance to pause the war.",
      "I asked Zelensky how he was dealing with the pressure. His goal, he said, was for his children to be able \"to walk down the street and not have to hide.\" And how did he think he'd be remembered; as the man who saved Ukraine, or tried to and failed? Zelensky grimaced slightly. Better, he said, than Putin, who was getting old and feared his own people.",
      "\"He will die soon. It is a fact. His reign could end before he finishes his historically insignificant and unsuccessful life. This is what he fears.\"",
      "Zelensky laughed.",
      "\"And I will do everything I can to defend Ukraine as much as I can. And I am definitely younger than Putin.\"",
      "Trump might be hoping for a deal by Easter. Zelensky is still looking to the long haul."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 03:00:45 GMT",
    "summary": "A cocktail of global and domestic conditions have complicated the government's run for a second term.",
    "story": [
      "When Cyclone Alfred barrelled over Australia's east coast earlier this month, it also blew the government's election plans off course.",
      "Hoping to capitalise on some rare good news on interest rates, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was on the cusp of announcing an April polling date. Instead he had to pivot and focus on responding to the natural disaster. It was, one Labor Minister told me, a decision taken from him by \"an act of God\".",
      "You might say that's been a theme of his government: big plans often derailed by unpleasant surprises \u2013 trying global economic conditions and a cost-of-living crisis which is battering many countries, foreign wars and tricky geopolitics, post-pandemic fallout and rising national divisions, and now giant storms.",
      "\"Global conditions are real,\" Albanese, who leads the Labor Party, said as he officially announced a 3 May election.",
      "Though, despite those challenges, he says his party has delivered. \"Landing where we have is like landing a 747 [jet] on a helicopter pad,\" he said, pointing to a recent increase in wage growth and falling inflation.",
      "But he wants a second term to reset.",
      "Standing in his way is Peter Dutton - a conservative who leads the Liberal Party, the dominant member of the so-called Coalition with the National Party of Australia \u2013 who just two years ago polling indicated was deeply unpopular.",
      "But the race between them is now so tight and the rise of independents or minor parties such that many are expecting a hung parliament.",
      "So how has it unravelled for Prime Minister Albanese?",
      "His victory in May 2022 was seen as a fresh start after nine years of conservative rule.",
      "Climate action was big on the agenda, as was addressing the cost-of-living and restoring stability to the country's leadership.",
      "But the legacy he eyed for his government was on Indigenous affairs. He opened his victory speech reiterating a pledge to hold a historic referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, an advisory body that would inform the government on issues that affect First Nations people.",
      "Albanese spent most of 2023 campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote. This was the moment, he hoped, that First Nations people would get constitutional recognition - finally catching up with other former British colonies - and that Australia would begin mending what many see as a very broken relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.",
      "But the proposal was decisively rejected, leaving many Indigenous people feeling disappointed and betrayed. Albanese was also left licking his wounds after a damaging campaign.",
      "Some critics blamed confusion and misinformation for why about 60% of Australians voted \"No\". But while Albanese was campaigning for the \"Yes\" vote, opposition leader Peter Dutton campaigned for \"No\", attacking Albanese for spending money on the referendum while a cost-of-living crisis intensified.",
      "\"[Dutton] not only won on the referendum, but also he won on positioning Labor as the government that's not completely focused on the issues that matter to Australia,\" says Kos Samaras, political consultant and a former Labor strategist.",
      "During Albanese's tenure, interest rates have been put up 12 times (and cut once, in February), inflation soared post-pandemic, the country's housing crisis deepened, and Australians increasingly felt stretched.",
      "Hurt ripples in wake of Indigenous Voice vote",
      "Has Australia cleaned up its act on climate?",
      "Though the prime minister would lay the blame for many of those issues at the previous coalition government's feet, voters want to know who is best placed to deal with all of them now.",
      "In Anthony Albanese's victory speech in 2022, he said Australia was \"the greatest country on earth\". Australian voters though are increasingly questioning whether that's still true \u2013 and perhaps more importantly, whether politicians from traditional parties are the ones able to fix it.",
      "So though many are disillusioned with Labor, this won't necessarily translate as a vote for Dutton's Coalition at the ballot box.",
      "Support for minor parties and independents reached record levels at the previous election, and similar is expected this time around. If neither party reaches the magic number of 76 seats in the House of Representatives, which poll after poll paints as unlikely, independent candidates could be the kingmakers of any future government.",
      "If that happens, Australia would be another page in a story unfolding all over the world - disenfranchised voters seeking more radical solutions and voting for change. In many places this is a real threat to democracy as people stop trusting the system.",
      "But while Australia faces the same challenges as other parts of the world, a few quirks in its electoral system have thus far guarded against more radical swings that we've seen in other countries, like the US, France and Germany.",
      "Experts all agree that mandatory voting is a key factor in Australia's political stability. In the 2022 elections, just under 90% of the population voted \u2013 much, much higher than the average OECD turnout of 69%. The fine for not voting in a federal election is a mere A$20 but there's a sense of duty here to go out and vote.",
      "What that means is politicians don't have to mobilise their bases \u2013 turnout is a given, it's just about pushing your narrative. Where voting is optional, there's a tendency for special interest groups to become overly influential as those who are less engaged decide not to cast a ballot. Plus, if everyone, no matter their politics, education or their wealth, goes to vote, it tends to pull the result towards a more representative centre.",
      "\"[Australia's] elections are decided in the middle,\" says the country's chief election analyst Antony Green. \"That means getting your message through those people who aren't paying much attention.\"",
      "The moment that changes Australia",
      "\u2018Not my King\u2019 protest row highlights Australian divisions",
      "The other big stabiliser for Australia, say experts, is preferential voting \u2013 where voters effectively number their candidates in order of who they want to win. It's why in recent years the Greens have emerged on the left and One Nation on the right but still, Labor and the Coalition dominate. Experts say preferential voting tempers the effects of polarisation and forces the two major parties to appeal to people who aren't necessarily voting for them first in order to receive their next preferences, which also helps moderate policy.",
      "While the campaign will focus on problems close to home, the candidates would be foolish to ignore the global political headwinds.",
      "During last year's presidential election, few analysts I spoke to seemed to think a Trump White House would massively impact Australia, this comparatively small and distant democracy.",
      "But five months feels like a lifetime in today's politics. Not a day goes by without Donald Trump making the headlines and Australians are tuning in to watch.",
      "With Trump's obvious disregard for longstanding alliances as well as constant talk of tariffs and trade wars, all this plays a part in Australians' fears about their place in the world \u2013 and importantly, the future of what is arguably its most important diplomatic and military relationship.",
      "Peter Dutton argues he'd be much better than Albanese at dealing with Trump. But there are doubts that anyone really knows how to handle this new administration \u2013 politicians of all stripes around the globe are feeling their way with how best to manage their relationship with the US.",
      "Allies unveil new details of nuclear submarine deal",
      "The laidback Australian city key to countering China",
      "With Albanese firing the starting gun today, Australians have just over a month of intense campaigning to help them determine who they want to lead them through the next three years.",
      "While Labor's handling of the ex-cyclone Alfred has improved its chances \u2013 the Prime Minister's approval ratings have risen to their highest level in 18 months \u2013 polling in recent months has pointed towards a Dutton administration.",
      "It's still incredibly close, and the Albanese government faces the unenviable prospect of being the first which fails to win a second term since 1931."

    "summary": "Affluent, urban Indians indulging their dogs and cats have led to the growth of India's pet care sector.",
    "story": [
      "For Neha Bapna, nothing in the world is more important than her dog Muffin.",
      "Every time she takes a train to travel across India, the four-year-old Shih Tzu is right by her side - in first class. He only eats hypoallergenic food, which is often double the price of normal dog food and treats.",
      "\"I have spent sleepless nights trying to figure out what food suits him. He is my child, I do not want him to have any trouble,\" says the 43-year-old Mumbai-based entrepreneur.",
      "Pampering one's pet used to be a luxury exclusive to the ultra-rich. But now affluent and middle-class urban Indians like Ms Bapna are splurging more on their \"fur babies\", fuelling a boom in India's pet care industry that has almost doubled in value in recent years.",
      "The pandemic has played a huge role, according to Ankur Bisen, senior partner at Technopak retail consultancy.",
      "\"Covid created a need for companionship when people were staying at home. So you could see young mothers, people in their first jobs, people who by choice decided not to have kids... All these people started going for pet ownership,\" he says.",
      "The number of pets in Indian households has grown sharply from 26 million in 2019 to 32 million in 2024, according to a report by consulting firm Redseer.",
      "And as late marriages, smaller family sizes and evolving social norms reshape family structures in urban India, these pets are increasingly being given the care and attention typically reserved for children.",
      "Nikhil Bhushan and Lakshna Gulati, who live in the capital, Delhi, say raising their pets allows them to experience parenthood without complexity.",
      "The couple, who have no biological children, share their home with two rescued pets: a dog named Mowgli and a cat named Marmalade.",
      "\"When we got married five years ago, we weren't ready to have children, but soon after rescuing the pets, our house truly became a home \u2013 there was something missing which is now complete. They bring us joy and seeing them every day brightens our lives,\" says Mr Bhushan.",
      "\"We like to spoil them,\" adds Ms Gulati. \"Whenever we see [a toy] they might like, we immediately buy it, even knowing it will be destroyed in no time.\"",
      "In 2024, Indians spent $3.6bn (\u00a32.78bn) on products and services for their pets, a substantial increase from $1.6bn in 2019, according to the Redseer report.",
      "This rapid growth has been fuelled by emerging trends such as pet boarding, insurance and specialised veterinary care.",
      "\"Twenty years ago, pet care was limited to basic services like vaccination and veterinary care,\" says Pankaj Poddar, chief executive of pet care company Zigly.",
      "\"Now, people want the best for their pets - whether it's clothing, accessories, or even specialised services,\" he says. \"I have seen parents spend as much as 10% of their incomes on their pets - be it taking them to special parties or even regular checkups.\"",
      "Ms Bapna, for instance, spends between 25,000 rupees ($290; \u00a3220) and 40,000 rupees on Muffin in a month, mostly on his travel and special diet.",
      "She takes her dog on a trip every few weeks, whether it's a day outing to a nearby farmhouse or a longer stay at a resort, and stays in pet-friendly accommodation which are pricier than regular hotels.",
      "When she takes the train to Jodhpur every few months to visit her parents, Ms Bapna buys first-class tickets - which are more than double the price of general tickets - as dogs and cats in India are only allowed in first-class coaches.",
      "Ms Bapna doesn't mind the huge bills. When it comes to spending on Muffin, she says, \"This is one area where I make no concessions.\"",
      "This kind of spending has propelled sales for pet care companies like Zigly.",
      "\"In the last eight-to-nine months, we have grown between 7% and 10% month-on-month,\" says Mr Poddar, whose company has reached a monthly gross merchandise value of around 46m rupees per month and is expected to reach 1bn rupees by next year.",
      "More companies which offer cheaper services, such as pet care chain The Pet Point, have also sprung up to cater to the increasingly middle-class clientele.",
      "For most Indian pet parents these days, \"value for money takes precedence over premiumisation\", says The Pet Point's co-founder Akshay Mahendru. \"A customer is more likely to get grooming services for their pet every week for 600 rupees, rather than somewhere above 1,500 rupees.\"",
      "Mr Mahendru says that sales for comparatively cheaper pet products like toys or snacks has also increased manifold with the emergence of quick commerce platforms like Zepto or Blinkit that do deliveries in 10-15 minutes.",
      "Experts are optimistic that India's pet care market has room to grow, given global trends. According to Bloomberg Intelligence's Pet Economy Report 2023, the global pet care sector, currently valued at $320bn, could exceed $500bn by the end of this decade.",
      "Redseer's report estimates India's pet care market to double in the next three years and potentially cross $7bn by 2028.",
      "But challenges still remain.",
      "India continues to be dogged by unequal economic growth, slowing consumption and wage stagnation which can dampen the industry's growth.",
      "Most cities here also lack pet-friendly public spaces, hotels and transport options, presenting a multitude of inconveniences to pet parents.",
      "Whenever Mr Bhushan and Ms Gulati travel with Mowgli, they bring portable beds and disposable plates and bowls \"so we're always prepared during our stays\", says Mr Bhushan.",
      "\"However, problems arise when we go for meals during our trips. Many places do not accept pets, which limits our options,\" he adds.",
      "Ms Bapna faces similar challenges when travelling with Muffin. But she is optimistic that things will change.",
      "\"When I first got him in 2021, there were very few pet-friendly places and activities. But now in Mumbai there are special events, resorts and cafes that welcome pets,\" she said.",
      "These days Muffin gets to attend \"socialisation events\", where he gets to play with other dogs, or goes to pet festivals where he can play games and sample special pet food.",
      "\"It gives me hope,\" Ms Bapna says with a smile.",

    "summary": "Strong wind, dry land and pine trees are a dangerous combination for wildfires, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Strong winds, dense forest and unusually dry weather - that's the deadly combination that experts say is fuelling the largest wildfires in South Korea's history.",
      "The inferno in the south-east has burned through 35,810 hectares (88,500 acres) as of Thursday - that's about half the size of New York City - killing 27 people so far and displacing tens of thousands.",
      "Authorities believe the wildfires started by accident from human activity, but the main drivers of the devastation are dry land, and strong gusts sweeping over inland regions.",
      "The high concentration of pine forest in North Gyeongsang province, where the fires are burning, is also \"oiling\" the blaze, said a forest disaster expert.",
      "Vulnerable pine forests",
      "\"Pine trees contain resin, which acts like oil, intensifying fires when ignited. This resin causes wildfires to burn faster, stronger, and longer,\" said Lee Byung-doo from the National Institute of Forest Science in Seoul.",
      "Andong, one of the worst-hit cities, is known for its tranquil pine forests.",
      "While they provide shelter and food for local wildlife and sometimes help break the wind, pine trees \"become problematic during wildfires\", Mr Lee told the BBC.",
      "\"Because forests [in South Korea] contain large numbers of pine trees, the areas are particularly vulnerable when fires break out,\" he said.",
      "Furthermore, pine trees retain their needles throughout winter, making them susceptible to \"crown fires\" - wildfires that spread by igniting the dense canopy of branches and leaves. This has contributed to the rapid and extensive spread of the flames over the past week.",
      "Unlike neighbouring countries such as China and North Korea, South Korea has made gains in forest cover over recent years.",
      "\"Most mountains are now filled with fallen leaves and pine trees... This accumulation has become a significant factor in accelerating the spread of wildfire,\" says Baek Min-ho, a disaster prevention specialist at Kangwon National University.",
      "Climate change is also to blame, experts say.",
      "\"This wildfire has once again exposed the harsh reality of a climate crisis unlike anything we've experienced before,\" South Korea's disaster chief Lee Han-kyung said on Thursday.",
      "The ideal environment for these record blazes has been building for the past few weeks, which saw temperatures rise above 20C (68F), unusually high for spring. Analysis by Climate Central, which researches climate science, suggests that these high temperatures have been made up to five times more likely by global warming.",
      "The unusual heat dried out the land and air, allowing fires to spread more rapidly, especially when combined with strong winds.",
      "Dense tree cover and strong winds in the fire-hit region also pose substantial challenges to firefighting efforts.",
      "On Wednesday, a 73-year-old pilot died when his firefighting helicopter crashed in Uiseong county. At least three other firefighters have been killed in the blazes.",
      "Elderly residents in second-oldest province",
      "Most of the 26 people who died are in their 60s and 70s, officials say. South Korea is an ageing society, where one in five people are at least 65 years old.",
      "North Gyeongsang is its second-oldest province, which also explains the relatively high death toll - it is especially difficult to evacuate older people in a disaster because they may have mobility issues or other health risks.",
      "They may also have more difficulty accessing or interpreting evacuation orders.",
      "Three residents of an elderly care facility in Yeongdeok county died on Wednesday, when the car they were in went up in flames. Only one out of four in the vehicle managed to flee in time, the Korea JoongAng Daily reported.",
      "Acting President Han Duck-soo said on Thursday it was \"worrying\" that many of the victims are elderly, as he ordered the interior minister to relocate to North Gyeongsang to oversee relief efforts.",

      "It came less than two weeks after Vietnamese and US companies signed more than $4bn (\u00a35.4bn) in deals, in areas including oil and gas exploration.",
      "Steve Norris from the consultancy Control Risks said \"Vietnam is being careful to avoid any moves which would signal any non-cooperation on trade issues\".",
      "This strategy is in line with its foreign policy approach - known as \"bamboo diplomacy\". Like shoots of plants that sway with the wind, Vietnam hopes to be adaptable to foreign pressures.",
      "\"If the US were to increase pressure on Vietnam, the government might respond with offers to facilitate investments in the hospitality and casino industries, undertake advanced machinery purchases, and \u2013 capturing the moment \u2013 consider access to Vietnam's rare earth minerals,\" Mr Norris said.",
      "What about China?",
      "One big factor working against Vietnam is concerns about China's influence.",
      "Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term.",
      "In 2018, he hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam.",
      "This has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure.",
      "Former US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said Vietnam has emerged as a \"destination for major Chinese investment\".",
      "While the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data.",
      "Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year.",
      "\"These are huge red flags for Trump. My expectation is that Vietnam will at some point be hit hard by tariffs,\" Mr Olson said.",
      "However, tariffs on Vietnam could impact US businesses such as tech firms Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike, which have moved production lines from China to Vietnam.",
      "A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed.",
      "The US president believes the levies will boost his country's economy by encouraging more businesses to make goods in the US and bring in billions of dollars of taxes.",
      "But many economists have warned that it could force up prices for American consumers and negatively impact global trade.",
      "What comes next?",
      "Washington is also concerned about so-called \"trans-shipments\" - Chinese goods passing through Vietnam on their way to other countries.",
      "US officials have been \"quietly stressing to Vietnam that it must reduce its trade surplus over time and combat the trans-shipment of Chinese goods through the country,\" Mr Norris said.",
      "Vietnam's prime minister has said he is confident that his administration can \"handle the relationship with the US\".",
      "Now that the South East Asian nation has cut some tariffs on US goods they may be more attractive to Vietnamese consumers, increasing America's share of trade with the country.",
      "And then there is golf - playing a game with Trump had worked for the late Japanese leader Shinzo Abe.",
      "Abe and Trump established a friendship, which included many golf games over several years. The friendship arguably helped Abe secure tariff exemptions for Japan's critical car industry at the time.",
      "For now, it is unclear if Vietnam would really give golf diplomacy a swing.",
      "The real test will come next week, when a new slate of Trump's taxes are set to take effect.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c626e935llwo",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 21:44:43 GMT",
    "summary": "As the nation prepares to head to the polls on 3 May, here's a guide to its electoral system and what to watch.",
    "story": [
      "On 3 May Australians will head to the polls to vote in their first federal election since 2022.",
      "The results will determine who the next prime minister will be, as well as the make-up of the nation's parliament.",
      "How does Australia's voting system work?",
      "Australia famously has a unique electoral system - and some quirky polling day traditions. Voting is mandatory for all citizens over 18, the country uses preferential voting, and picking up a \"democracy sausage\" is a polling day custom.",
      "Almost 18 million people are registered to vote in this election - roughly 98% of those who are eligible.",
      "Unlike the First Past the Post system - used in the UK and most US states - which elects candidates based on who has received the greatest number of votes in a single count, regardless of whether they've secured an absolute majority - voters in Australia rank candidates in order of preference.",
      "If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first tally, the votes from the least popular candidates are then redistributed, and that process repeated until someone secures a majority.",
      "In races for the House of Representatives, voters are required to mark a preference down for every single candidate listed on the ballot.",
      "However, in Senate races, voters only need to mark down a designated number of preferences.",
      "It is the leader of the party that receives the most seats in the House who then becomes prime minister. There is no separate leadership ballot.",
      "Who is being elected?",
      "All of the seats in Australia's House of Representatives - that's 150 in this election -will be up for grabs, as will 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate.",
      "Australia has two major parties: the left-leaning Australian Labor Party and the conservative Liberal-National coalition.",
      "One party needs to win at least 76 seats in the House to form a majority government.",
      "If it cannot do that, it must try to win support from minor parties or independent MPs.",
      "In both state and federal elections, the vote share for minor parties and independents has been steadily increasing in Australia for decades.",
      "That reached record levels in the 2022 federal election, with one in three Australians casting votes for candidates outside the two major parties.",
      "Who is in power currently?",
      "Labor formed a majority government after winning the 2022 election, which delivered the biggest loss for the Liberal Party since its inception.",
      "As it stands, Labor has 78 seats in the House of Representatives, while the coalition has 57, with minor parties and independents splitting the remainder.",
      "But with one House seat abolished, if Labor loses just two seats at this election it will be stripped of its majority in parliament.",
      "In order to form a government in its own right, the coalition needs to win 19 seats, likely including many of those it lost to independent candidates during the 2022 vote.",
      "Who is in the running to be prime minister?",
      "Anthony Albanese has been the prime minister since the last election, and a stalwart of parliament for almost 30 years.",
      "While he enjoyed a period of broad popularity after coming to power in 2022, he has in recent times come under pressure over his handling of divisive topics like housing, Indigenous affairs and both antisemitism and Islamophobia.",
      "Albanese is being challenged by Peter Dutton, who became head of the Liberal-National coalition after their 2022 defeat. He is contesting his first election as opposition leader.",
      "Known as a staunch conservative, Dutton has years of experience in important ministerial portfolios - like defence and home affairs - but has been a controversial figure at times, particularly on social issues.",
      "What are the key issues?",
      "Both the polling and the political messaging around this year's election indicate that cost of living is the biggest concern for many voters.",
      "Since the 2022 election, inflation - which is now slowing - has pushed up the prices of everyday essentials such as food and utilities, leaving many households feeling stretched.",
      "The Albanese government has implemented a string of policies that it says are aimed at providing relief, such as keeping the cost of medications down, and offering tax cuts, energy rebates and rental assistance to those eligible.",
      "However, Australia has raised interest rates 12 times since Albanese was elected in May 2022 - something that is done independently of government but seen to reflect their economic management - and that has put additional pressure on borrowers and those with mortgages across the country.",
      "Housing affordability will also be a key issue this election cycle, with several Australian cities among the most expensive in the world for homebuyers.",
      "The year the Australian Dream died",
      "Albanese faces headwinds ahead of Australian election",
      "When will we know the results?",
      "Historically, Australians are used to getting a result and knowing who will form government on election night.",
      "However, it is usually not the Australian Election Commission - the official body tasked with manually counting the votes - that declares this.",
      "Instead, the AEC provides what's known as an \"indicative count\" throughout the day, which media commentators, election experts and sometimes even the parties and candidates themselves then base their calls on.",
      "The AEC does not formally declare a seat until it is confident the result will not change based on the number of uncounted votes, which can sometimes take days."

    "summary": "Fighting in a mineral-rich region of central Africa proves a quandary for Chinese business interests.",
    "story": [
      "China's efforts to build up huge business interests across Africa have been accompanied by a careful policy of maintaining neutrality - but the conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has caused a shift in its approach.",
      "Rwanda has been widely accused of stoking the fighting in the mineral-rich region and Beijing, which has close relations with both DR Congo and Rwanda, has in recent weeks joined the criticism.",
      "But it is trying to walk a diplomatic tightrope to maintain good relations with both countries, while also continuing to operate its businesses - and buy crucial minerals.",
      "How is China's response to this conflict different?",
      "For decades, China has been careful not to take sides in conflicts in Africa, to avoid causing problems that might interfere with its extensive commercial interests.",
      "Up to now it has shied away from criticising African governments for supporting participants in a conflict.",
      "For example, China has said little about the series of coups since 2020 in West Africa's Sahel region, except to urge leaders to consider the interests of the people.",
      "Beijing has long pursued a policy of non-interference in another state's internal affairs, says Prof Zhou Yuyuan, who specialises in African development and security at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS).",
      "It therefore avoids proposing solutions to conflicts, apart from calling for diplomatic or political efforts by international organisations such as the UN or the African Union.",
      "The unrest involving Rwandan-back M23 rebels in eastern DR Congo reared its head again in 2021. The fighters are led by ethnic Tutsis who say they took up arms to protect the rights of the minority group - and because the Congolese authorities reneged on an earlier peace deal.",
      "In its early comments on these developments, China restricted itself to criticising unnamed \"foreign forces\" for providing support to the M23 fighters.",
      "But in the last few weeks it has broken from its usual practice and referred to Rwanda by name.",
      "This follows major gains by the M23, which since January has captured the key cities of Goma and Bukavu.",
      "\"China reiterates its hope that Rwanda will\u2026 stop its military support for M23 and immediately withdraw all its military forces from the DRC territory,\" China's UN ambassador said in February.",
      "Prof Zhou notes that though significant, the \"wording in general is still relatively mild\".",
      "\"China 'hoped' that Rwanda would stop its support but did not condemn it,\" he says.",
      "However, soon afterwards China backed a UN Security Council resolution which bluntly calls on the Rwanda Defence Forces to \"cease support to the M23 and immediately withdraw from DRC territory without preconditions\".",
      "Why has China made this shift?",
      "According to Prof Zhou, China's statements are likely to have been prompted by UN expert reports, which have provided strong evidence of Rwanda's support for the M23.",
      "\"This is a basic consensus in the UN Security Council,\" he added.",
      "\"The problem has been going on long enough, and everyone knows in their hearts the basic situation. There's no need to be hush-hush any more.\"",
      "Neither China's mission to the UN nor its embassy in London responded when asked why China had criticised Rwanda.",
      "But the critical importance to China of DR Congo's renowned mineral wealth may have been a factor.",
      "Fighting in eastern DR Congo has been concentrated in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu, home to many Chinese-run gold mines.",
      "How these mines have been affected by the fighting is so far unclear.",
      "The M23 has also seized territory containing mines for coltan ore, which China imports in large volumes.",
      "The metal tantalum, used in cars and everyday electronics from TV sets to mobile phones, is extracted from this ore, and DR Congo is the source of 40% of the world's supply.",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo",
      "A UN expert group said in December 2024 that the M23 had smuggled coltan to Rwanda from DR Congo. It also noted that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023.",
      "Although Rwanda has its own coltan mines, analysts say they could not account for such a large increase in production.",
      "It is not yet clear whether the volume or the price of coltan imported by China has been affected.",
      "Another mineral that China imports from DR Congo is cobalt, which is crucial for the lithium battery industry.",
      "However, China's cobalt mining operations are primarily based in southern DR Congo, away from the conflict zones in the east.",
      "Dozens of Chinese companies, many of which are state-owned, are also building roads, telecommunications and hydropower facilities in DR Congo. But it seems that the impact on these activities has so far been minimal.",
      "Does China provide military support to Rwanda or DR Congo?",
      "China's supplies weapons to both Rwanda and DR Congo.",
      "In the past two decades, the Rwandan military has bought Chinese armoured vehicles, artillery and anti-tank missiles, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).",
      "China posted a military attach\u00e9 to the country for the first time in 2024.",
      "While UN experts say the Rwandan military has armed the M23, it is unclear whether the rebel group is using any Chinese weapons.",
      "The Congolese armed forces have bought Chinese armoured personnel carriers and drones.",
      "They also own Chinese tanks, which were bought in 1976 but were still in use as recently as 2022.",
      "It is reported that the drones, at least, have been used in the fight against the M23.",
      "Have China's relations with either country been affected?",
      "The Rwandan embassy in Beijing said ties with China remained \"excellent and productive\", and it was not for Rwanda to comment on China's statement about the fighting in eastern DR Congo.",
      "The Chinese ambassador to DR Congo, Zhao Bin, held discussions with Congolese Senate President Sama Lukonde in early February but no details of the meeting were made public.",
      "China's economic activities in the two countries go very deep. They are both part of China's Belt and Road initiative, designed to stitch China closer to the world through investments and infrastructure projects.",
      "In Rwanda, China has funded stadiums, schools and highways. Chinese loans are also funding infrastructure projects - a loan to fund a dam and irrigation system, worth an estimated $40m (\u00a331m), was confirmed in January.",
      "For years most goods imported into Rwanda have come from China.",
      "When it comes to China's economic ties with DR Congo, the UN Comtrade Database shows that for years China has been DR Congo's top trading partner.",
      "China has gone to great lengths to secure access to DR Congo's mineral wealth.",
      "It extended $3.2bn (\u00a32.5bn) of loans to the country between 2005 and 2022, according to the Chinese Loans to Africa Database run by Boston University, mostly to fund road and bridge construction, and the country's electricity grid.",

    "summary": "Weak domestic consumption and muted export demand are restricting expansion plans, according to a report.",
    "story": [
      "What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms?",
      "It's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.",
      "After a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.",
      "Analysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.",
      "Over the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments.",
      "Banking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.",
      "Data from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments.",
      "So why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?",
      "Weak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.",
      "But beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.",
      "Slowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.",
      "Investments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.",
      "India's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.",
      "With all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.",
      "According to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.",
      "Key to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.",
      "The government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.",
      "But none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.",
      "According to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.",
      "India's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.",
      "\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.",
      "Rathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.",
      "\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.",
      "He said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.",
      "\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.",
      "But things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.",
      "Interest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.",
      "India's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen.",
      "The uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra.",

    "summary": "We unpick excerpts from a group chat by high-ranking US security officials about an air strike on Yemen.",
    "story": [
      "A discussion by high-ranking US security officials about US air strikes on Yemen has been published in full by the Atlantic magazine.",
      "The group chat on the Signal app mistakenly included the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.",
      "After holding back some excerpts of the chat in an earlier article, he decided on Wednesday to publish almost the entire exchange after senior officials insisted there was no classified information shared in the group.",
      "Those statements \"have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions\", Goldberg wrote.",
      "The messages, however, need some unpicking. Here are three of them with some analysis.",
      "Timetable for the attack",
      "These messages provide details of the US military's plan for the Yemen strikes - described as a \"package\", a military term which refers to a set of aircraft, weapons systems and intelligence gathering devices that will participate in an operation.",
      "\"The idea this wasn't classified information at the time is inconceivable,\" Glenn Gerstell, the former general counsel of the National Security Agency (NSA), told the BBC.",
      "He added that it may have been declassified afterwards but any imminent military action involving American troops would have been classified at the time it was shared.",
      "The messages from Hegseth note what time F-18 fighter aircraft are scheduled to launch, as well as when strikes will take place and in what timeframe \"trigger-based\" attacks could occur.",
      "In this context, \"trigger\" refers to a set of parameters that have to be acknowledged before weapons are deployed. It could be a visual reference point, like a mobile phone lighting up.",
      "This information is considered highly sensitive.",
      "Philip Ingram, a former military intelligence officer with the British Army, told the BBC that similar information \"falls firmly into the bracket of what would have been classified top secret\".",
      "\"You can practically plot where the aircraft are going to come from,\" he added.",
      "In the wake of the chat's revelations, the White House and other US officials have argued that this information does not constitute a \"war plan\".",
      "In a post on X, Hegseth said: \"The Atlantic released the so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods.\"",
      "A 'missile guy' hit at girlfriend's home",
      "In this part of the group chat, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz provides an update on the strike - which in military parlance is called a battle damage assessment, or BDA.",
      "Waltz notes that the target building has collapsed, and that the US military had earlier had positive identification of the target - a Houthi \"missile guy\" - walking into the building, which was believed to be his girlfriend's residence.",
      "In his message, Waltz congratulates Pete - referring to Hegseth, as well as the IC, shorthand for \"intelligence community\" and Kurilla, a reference to Michael Kurilla, a US Army General who oversees Central Command, a regional combatant command with responsibility over the Middle East and parts of Central and South Asia.",
      "The messages do not reveal how the target's whereabouts or movements were tracked.",
      "A military expert contacted by the BBC - but who wished to remain nameless - suggested that a combination of aerial platforms, technological tracking capabilities or human intelligence on the ground could have been used, or a combination of various sources.",
      "At least 53 people were killed in the initial wave of US airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, which struck more than 30 targets  including training facilities, drone infrastructure, as well as weapons manufacturing and storage sites and command and control centres, including one in which the Pentagon said several unmanned aerial vehicle experts were located.",
      "It is unclear which of the targets Waltz was referring to in the group chat.",
      "CIA activities in Yemen",
      "Another potentially sensitive message comes from Joe Kent, a former special operations soldier and failed congressional candidate who was nominated by Trump to be the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center.",
      "In his message, Kent refers to Israel carrying out their own strikes.",
      "The Israeli military has repeatedly struck Houthi targets in Yemen since the beginning of the war in Gaza, in retaliation for Houthi missile and drone attacks on Israeli targets conducted in support of Hamas.",
      "The most recent attacks took place on 19 and 26 December of last year.",
      "According to Kent, the Israeli government would seek to \"replenish\" any weapons stocks used in further raids, although he believes that to be a \"minor factor\".",
      "A slightly more sensitive message follows from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who notes that the US is  \"mobilising assets\" to help a strike, but that a delay would \"not negatively impact\" the agency's work in Yemen.",
      "\"Additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership,\" he wrote.",
      "Assets, in this context, could refer to CIA-run spies on the ground in Yemen, or technological means such as surveillance drone flights.",
      "Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence and ex-CIA paramilitary officer, said that Ratcliffe's message was very sensitive.",
      "\"Essentially, we don't want to share where the CIA is focused,\" he added.",
      "Ratcliffe told a House hearing on Wednesday that he did not transmit classified information.",

    "story": [
      "This is the gravest crisis for Western security since the end of World War Two, and a lasting one. As one expert puts it, \"Trumpism will outlast his presidency\". But which nations are equipped to step to the fore as the US stands back?",
      "At 09.00 one morning in February 1947, the UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Inverchapel, walked into the State Department to hand the US Secretary of State, George Marshall, two diplomatic messages printed on blue paper to emphasise their importance: one on Greece, the other on Turkey.",
      "Exhausted, broke and heavily in debt to the United States, Britain told the US that it could no longer continue its support for the Greek government forces that were fighting an armed Communist insurgency. Britain had already announced plans to pull out of Palestine and India and to wind down its presence in Egypt.",
      "The United States saw immediately that there was now a real danger that Greece would fall to the Communists and, by extension, to Soviet control. And if Greece went, the United States feared that Turkey could be next, giving Moscow control of the Eastern Mediterranean including, potentially, the Suez Canal, a vital global trade route.",
      "Almost overnight, the United States stepped into the vacuum left by the departing British.",
      "\"It must be a policy of the United States,\" President Harry Truman announced, \"to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressure.\"",
      "It was the start of what became known as the Truman Doctrine. At its heart was the idea that helping to defend democracy abroad was vital to the United States' national interests.",
      "There followed two major US initiatives: the Marshall Plan, a massive package of assistance to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe, and the creation of Nato in 1949, which was designed to defend democracies from a Soviet Union that had now extended its control over the eastern part of Europe.",
      "It is easy to see this as the moment that leadership of the western world passed from Britain to the United States. More accurately it is the moment that revealed that it already had.",
      "The United States, traditionally isolationist and safely sheltered by two vast oceans, had emerged from World War Two as the leader of the free world. As America projected its power around the globe, it spent the post-war decades remaking much of the world in its own image.",
      "The baby boomer generation grew up in a world that looked, sounded and behaved more like the United States than ever before. And it became the western world's cultural, economic and military hegemon.",
      "Yet the fundamental assumptions on which the United States has based its geostrategic ambitions now look set to change.",
      "Donald Trump is the first US President since World War Two to challenge the role that his country set for itself many decades ago. And he is doing this in such a way that, to many, the old world order appears to be over - and the new world order has yet to take shape.",
      "The question is, which nations will step forward? And, with the security of Europe under greater strain than at any time almost in living memory, can its leaders, who are currently scrabbling around, find an adequate response?",
      "A challenge to the Truman legacy",
      "President Trump's critique of the post-1945 international order dates back decades. Nearly 40 years ago he took out full-page advertisements in three US newspapers to criticise the United States' commitment to the defence of the world's democracies.",
      "\"For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States,\" he wrote in 1987. \"Why are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing to protect their interests?",
      "\"The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help.\"",
      "It's a position he has repeated since his second inauguration.",
      "And the fury felt by some in his administration for what they perceive as European reliance on the United States was apparently shown in the leaked messages about air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that emerged this week.",
      "In the messages, an account named Vice-President JD Vance wrote that European countries might benefit from the strikes. It said: \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"",
      "Another account, identified as Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, responded three minutes later: \"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"",
      "Trump's own position appears to go beyond criticising those he says are taking advantage of the United State's generosity. At the start of his second presidency, he seemed to embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling Russia that Ukraine would not be granted Nato membership and that it should not expect to get back the territory it has lost to Russia.",
      "Many saw this as giving away two major bargaining chips before talks had even started. He apparently asked Russia for nothing in return.",
      "On the flipside, certain Trump supporters see in Putin a strong leader who embodies many of the conservative values they themselves share.",
      "To some, Putin is an ally in a \"war on woke\".",
      "The United States' foreign policy is now driven, in part at least, by the imperatives of its culture wars. The security of Europe has become entangled in the battle between two polarised and mutually antagonistic visions of what the United States stands for.",
      "Some think the division is about more than Trump's particular views and that Europe can not just sit tight waiting for his term in office to end.",
      "\"The US is becoming divorced from European values,\" argues Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London. \"That's difficult [for Europeans] to swallow because it means that it's structural, cultural and potentially long-term. \"",
      "\"I think the current trajectory of the US will outlast Trump, as a person. I think Trumpism will outlast his presidency.\"",
      "Nato Article 5 'is on life support'",
      "The Trump White House has said it will no longer be the primary guarantor of European security, and that European nations should be responsible for their own defence and pay for it.",
      "\"If [Nato countries] don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them,\" the president said earlier this month.",
      "For almost 80 years, the cornerstone of European security has been embedded in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one member state of the alliance is an attack on all.",
      "In Downing Street last month, just before his visit to the White House, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told me during an interview that he was satisfied that the United States remained the leading member of Nato and that Trump personally remained committed to Article 5.",
      "Others are less sure.",
      "Ben Wallace, who was defence secretary in the last Conservative government, told me earlier this month: \"I think Article 5 is on life support.",
      "\"If Europe, including the United Kingdom, doesn't step up to the plate, invest a lot on defence and take it seriously, it's potentially the end of the Nato that we know and it'll be the end of Article 5.",
      "\"Right now, I wouldn't bet my house that Article 5 would be able to be triggered in the event of a Russian attack\u2026 I certainly wouldn't take for granted that the United States would ride to the rescue.\"",
      "According to polling by the French company Institut Elabe, nearly three quarters of French people now think that the United States is not an ally of France. A majority in Britain and a very large majority in Denmark, both historically pro-American countries, now have unfavourable views of the United States as well.",
      "\"The damage Trump has done to Nato is probably irreparable,\" argues Robert Kagan, a conservative commentator, author and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC who has been a long time critic of Trump.",
      "\"The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least\".",
      "And yet Trump is by no means the first US president to tell Europe to get its defence spending in order. In 2016 Barack Obama urged Nato allies to increase theirs, saying: \"Europe has sometimes been complacent about its own defence.\"",
      "Has a 'fragmentation of the West' begun?",
      "All of this is great news for Putin. \"The entire system of Euro-Atlantic security is crumbling before our eyes,\" he said last year. \"Europe is being marginalised in global economic development, plunged into the chaos of challenges such as migration, and losing international agency and cultural identity.\"",
      "In early March, three days after Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous meeting with Trump and Vance in the White House, a Kremlin spokesman declared \"the fragmentation of the West has begun\".",
      "\"Look at Russia's objectives in Europe,\" says Armida van Rij, head of the Europe programme at Chatham House. \"Its objectives are to destabilise Europe. It is to weaken Nato, and get the Americans to withdraw their troops from here.",
      "\"And at the moment you could go 'tick, tick and almost tick'. Because it is destabilising Europe. It is weakening Nato. It hasn't gone as far as to get the US to withdraw troops from Europe, but in a few months time, who knows where we'll be?\"",
      "'We forgot the lessons of our history'",
      "One of the great challenges Europe, in particular, faces from here is the question of how to arm itself adequately. Eighty years of reliance on the might of the United States has left many European democracies exposed.",
      "Britain, for example, has cut military spending by nearly 70% since the height of the Cold War. (At the end of the Cold War, in the early 1990s, Europe allowed itself a peace dividend and began a decades-long process of reducing defence spending.)",
      "\"We had a big budget [during the Cold War] and we took a peace dividend,\" says Wallace. \"Now, you could argue that that was warranted.",
      "\"The problem is we went from a peace dividend to corporate raiding. [Defence] just became the go-to department to take money from. And that is where we just forgot the lessons of our history.\"",
      "The prime minister told parliament last month that Britain would increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027. But is that enough?",
      "\"It isn't enough just to stand still,\" argues Wallace. \"It wouldn't be enough to fix the things we need to make ourselves more deployable, and to plug the gaps if the Americans left.\"",
      "Then there is the wider question of military recruitment. \"The West is in freefall in its military recruiting, it's not just Britain,\" argues Wallace.",
      "\"At the moment, young people aren't joining the military. And that's a problem.\"",
      "But Germany's new Chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has said Europe must make itself independent of the United States. And \"Europeanising\" NATO will require the build up of an indigenous European military-industrial complex capable of delivering capabilities that currently only the United States has.",
      "Others share the view that Europe must become more self reliant militarily - but some are concerned that not all of Europe is on board with this.",
      "\"Where we are at the moment is that the East Europeans by and large, don't need to get the memo,\" says Ian Bond, deputy director, Centre for European Reform. \"The further west you go, the more problematic it becomes until you get to Spain and Italy.\"",
      "Mr Arnold agrees: \"The view in Europe now is this isn't really a debate anymore, it's a debate of how we do it and maybe how quickly we do it, but we need to do this now.\"",
      "Piecing together a new world order",
      "There is a short list of \"very important things\" that only the United States currently provides, according to historian Timothy Garton Ash.",
      "\"These are the so-called strategic enablers,\" he says. \"The satellites, the intelligence, the Patriot air defence batteries, which are the only ones that can take down Russian ballistic missiles. And within three to five years we [countries other than the US] should aim to have our own version of these.",
      "\"And in this process of transition, from the American-led Nato [the idea is] you will have a Nato that is so Europeanised that its forces, together with national forces and EU capacities, are capable of defending Europe - even if an American president says 'leave us out of this'.\"",
      "The question is how to achieve this.",
      "Ms van Rij stresses that, in her view, Europe does need to build a Europe-owned European defence industrial base - but she foresees difficulties.",
      "\"What's really difficult are the divisions within Europe on how to actually do this and whether to actually do this.\"",
      "The European Commission and experts have been trying to figure out how this defence may work for several decades. \"It has traditionally been very difficult because of vested national interests... So this is not going to be easy.\"",
      "In the meantime, Trump appears ready to turn the page on the post-Cold War rules-based international order of sovereign states that are free to choose their own destinies and alliances.",
      "What he seems to share with Vladimir Putin is a desire for a world in which the major powers, unconstrained by internationally agreed laws, are free to impose their will on smaller, weaker nations, as Russia has traditionally done in both its Tsarist and Soviet Empires. That would mean a return to the \"spheres of interest\" system that prevailed for 40 years after the Second World War.",
      "We don't know exactly what Donald Trump would do were a Nato country to be attacked. But the point is that the guarantee of US help can no longer be taken for granted. That means Europe has to react. Its challenge appears to be to stay united, finally make good on funding its own defence, and avoid being drawn into the \"sphere of influence\" of any of the big powers.",

    "summary": "She was called \"a gold digger\" and \"a murderer\" after the death of her actor boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.",
    "story": [
      "Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty was called \"a gold digger\" and \"a murderer\". She was slut-shamed and spent 27 days in prison after a hate-filled vicious media campaign in 2020 alleged she had been involved in the death of her actor boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.",
      "Now, India's federal investigators have told a court that Rajput, a rising star in India's popular Hindi film industry, died by suicide and that neither Chakraborty nor her family had a role in his death.",
      "In a statement shared with the BBC, senior lawyer Satish Maneshinde, who fought Chakraborty's case, said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had \"thoroughly investigated every aspect of the case from all angles and closed it\".",
      "The findings have been presented in a special court in Mumbai, which will now decide whether to close the case or to order further investigation.",
      "Mr Maneshinde said Chakraborty went through \"untold miseries\" and was jailed \"for no fault of hers\".",
      "\"The false narrative in the social media and electronic media was totally uncalled for,\" he said, calling on media bosses to \"reflect upon what they did\".",
      "\"Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.\"",
      "Feminist lawyer Payal Chawla, meanwhile, described the \"misogynistic narrative surrounding Chakraborty\" as \"deeply troubling\" and said the case \"should serve as a cautionary reminder of the perils of being judgmental\".",
      "Chakraborty herself has offered no comment since news of CBI wanting to close the case broke at the weekend. On Monday, she was seen visiting a temple along with her brother and father - who were also named in a police complaint filed over Rajput's death.",
      "Perhaps the only sign that the family feel vindicated comes from her brother Showik - who spent three months in prison before being freed on bail. He shared a photo with Rhea and the caption \"Satyamev Jayate\" - Sanskrit for \"truth alone prevails\".",
      "Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on 14 June 2020. Mumbai police said the 34-year-old had mental health issues, for which he was under treatment, and appeared to have taken his own life.",
      "Chakraborty, who had been dating Rajput for a year and was living with him, had gone to live with her parents a few days before his death.",
      "\"Still struggling to face my emotions... an irreparable numbness in my heart\u2026 I will never come to terms with you not being here anymore,\" she later wrote on social media about her grief.",
      "But within weeks, the actress found herself at the centre of a firestorm after Rajput's father lodged a police complaint, accusing Chakraborty of stealing his son's money and contributing to his suicide. He also denied that his son had any mental health issues.",
      "The Rajput family has not commented on the latest developments regarding his death.",
      "Chakraborty, who consistently denied all the allegations against her, appealed to the government to order a fair probe into the death.",

      "Rhea Chakraborty on 'media trial' after Bollywood star's death",
      "Why is Indian TV obsessed with Sushant Singh Rajput's death?",
      "However, the tragedy - which came in the midst of a lockdown while India was struggling with the coronavirus pandemic - became the biggest prime-time story for a nation glued to their television sets.",
      "And Chakraborty became the subject of misogynistic abuse, with trolls calling her a \"witch\", a \"fortune huntress\", a \"mafia moll\" and \"sex bait to trap rich men\". She received rape and death threats.",
      "Some of India's most high-profile television hosts dedicated their entire shows to discussing the case, describing her as a \"manipulative\" woman who \"performed black magic\" and \"drove Sushant to suicide\".",
      "A video that went viral at the time showed a prominent news anchor hysterically gesticulating and accusing Chakraborty of being \"a druggie\". Another channel had a female anchor walk in on the live set, claiming she had \"a bagful of documents\" that could prove the actress's guilt.",
      "The vicious hate campaign continued until Chakraborty was arrested three months after Rajput's death.",
      "She was released a month later and has since tried her hand at motivational speaking and has now reinvented herself as a businesswoman who has launched a clothing line and her own podcast with celebrity interviews. She is also doing a reality TV show.",
      "Chakraborty has also spoken about her ordeal, including how the name-calling and character assassination cost her work and how her family were also hounded.",
      "\"I tried contacting people in the [Hindi film] industry, asking for roles, any roles. But then I realised that people won't cast you because of all that had happened,\" she told Humans of Bombay last year.",
      "\"I was very angry for a long time. But it gave me acidity and I suffered from gut issues. So, it became important for me to forgive,\" she said, adding \" I have not forgiven everyone. Some people are on my hit list.",
      "It is not clear what action she is contemplating against those who vilified her, but many are now suggesting on social media that she sue them for damages.",
      "While neither the actress or her lawyer have not yet said what they intend to do, columnist Namita Bhandare points out that seeking compensation in India, with its overburdened judiciary and millions of pending court cases, is anything but easy.",
      "\"A defamation case can go on for a decade and she would possibly get an apology at the end of it. So would she even bother to do that?\"",
      "According to Ms Bhandare, Chakraborty \"became expendable in the pursuit of a juicy story\" since she \"was not a big name and had no powerful people backing her in the film industry\".",
      "What happened, the columnist continued, \"was in keeping with the traditional Indian thinking\" to blame the female partner left behind, and also highlighted the \"dark side of social media, which tends to find a villain and then sets about demolishing their reputation\".",
      "Some of the videos of prominent news anchors making slanderous comments against Chakraborty have now resurfaced, and are being shared extensively on social media. Many people, including some of the actress's Bollywood colleagues, are demanding that the presenters apologise to her.",

    "summary": "Ukraine long-range drone makers are worried Russia will use the ceasefire to gather strength and attack again.",
    "story": [
      "At a secret location away from prying eyes, Ukrainian engineers test a long-range drone called Raybird.",
      "The machine, which looks like a mini plane with wings, is placed on a launchpad, stretched like an arrow on a crossbow and then shot into the air.",
      "Raybird can fly non-stop for more than 20 hours and cover a distance of more than 1,000km (620 miles). It carries out reconnaissance missions, and is also used to destroy targets both on the front line and deep inside Russia.",
      "Among their targets are oil refineries and fuel depots.",
      "But after Russia and Ukraine reached separate agreements with the US on a partial ceasefire, missions like these should stop.",
      "As well as agreeing to a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea following talks this week in Saudi Arabia, the two countries committed to stop attacking each other's energy infrastructure \u2013 something that had theoretically already been agreed.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine would implement these agreements immediately.",
      "Russia says sanctions must be lifted before Ukraine maritime ceasefire can start",
      "However, Oleksiy from Skyeton, the company that develops the Raybird, doubts that Moscow would adhere to the ceasefire.",
      "\"[Russians punch you in the face, then the next day they make an agreement but ask to tie up your hands. So the possibility that they will continue fighting remains,\" explains Oleksiy.",
      "Yet, this deal will also bring relief to Russia.",
      "It's estimated that this year alone, Ukraine carried out more than 30 attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure using drones and other weapons.",
      "They've recently hit some of the country's largest oil facilities, like the Ufa oil refinery about 1,500km (932 miles) from the front line and Tuapse plant in Krasnodar region.",
      "Russia's oil refining capacity has dropped by about 10% as a result of drone attacks, according to Reuters.",
      "And Moscow's recent decision to extend the ban on petroleum exports shows that they're feeling the pain.",
      "Ukraine's arsenal to carry out deep strikes is only growing. President Zelensky recently announced that Ukrainian engineers have designed a drone that has a range of 3,000 km (1,860 miles). That means it could reach not only Moscow, but even locations in Siberia.",
      "Kyiv also claims that it has developed turbojet powered \"missile-drones\". They fly at a much higher speed and so are harder to intercept.",
      "Zelensky said Ukraine has successfully tested its first domestically made ballistic weapon and upgraded its cruise missile Neptune to hit ground as well as naval targets. This missile was reportedly used to attack the Russian air base in the southern city of Engels last week, although Ukrainian officials neither confirm nor deny these reports.",
      "The energy ceasefire deal is certainly good news for Ukraine too. Russia has been relentlessly targeting its power plants and stations across the country. At one point last year, Ukraine's energy generation capacity dropped to a third of its pre-war level.",
      "Last month, when temperatures dropped below zero, Russian drones hit a thermal power plant in Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. A few days later, another massive aerial attack left more than 250,000 residents of Odesa without power and heating.",
      "And lately, there has been a growing number of attacks on Ukraine's gas infrastructure. Among regular targets are underground gas storage facilities in western Ukraine and production facilities in the central and eastern parts of the country.",
      "Moscow's aim is to reduce gas production in Ukraine, which is key to the country's energy security, says Artem Petrenko, executive director of the Association of Gas Producers of Ukraine.",
      "At the end of March, Gas storage facilities in Ukraine were only around 4% full, according to one monitoring group.",
      "And if Russia continues its strikes, filling up those storage facilities will be extremely challenging, potentially leading to massive problems next winter.",
      "Back at the testing ground, after several laps, the Raybird opens its parachutes and successfully lands in the field.",
      "Oleksiy is satisfied with the results. He says that although it's good to have a ceasefire, they still cannot afford to pause their work and the development of new weapons.",

    "story": [
      "\"It took a huge amount of courage to speak out,\" NewJeans have told the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label, in a case that has rocked the K-pop industry.",
      "\"This fight is necessary. Although it will be extremely difficult and arduous, we will keep doing what we have done so far and speak up,\" said Haerin, one of the members of the five-piece.",
      "\"We thought it was important to tell the world about what we've been through. All the choices we've made so far have been the best choices we could have made.\"",
      "NewJeans looked invincible in the charts when they launched what was an unusual rebellion in the high-pressure, tightly-controlled world of K-pop. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji stunned South Korea and fans everywhere with their decision in November to split from Ador, the label that launched them.",
      "They alleged mistreatment, workplace harassment and an attempt to \"undermine their careers\", which Ador denies. It sued to enforce their seven-year contract, which is set to expire in 2029, and sought an injunction against any commercial activities by the group.",
      "On Friday, a South Korean court granted it, ordering NewJeans to stop all \"independent\" activities, including song releases and advertising deals, while the case was still under way. NewJeans has since challenged the injunction in court.",
      "Friday's ruling was a \"shock\", the group told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people think that we're famous enough to do whatever we want and say whatever we please. But the truth is, it's not like that at all,\" Hyein said. \"We held it in for a long time, and only now have we finally spoken up about what we think, what we feel and the unfairness we've experienced.\"",
      "The K-pop industry has repeatedly come under fire for the pressure it puts on its stars not only to perform and succeed, but to appear perfect. But rarely do conflicts spill into the public, exposing stars' grievances and rifts with their labels.",
      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",
      "\"I was stunned,\" Minji says. So were the others when she told them. \"At first I thought I didn't hear her properly,\" Danielle says. \"We were all kind of in shock.\"",
      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",
      "\"It wasn't any easy decision to make,\" Hyein said on stage, as each of them took turns to address their fans. \"But at the moment for us, it's about protecting ourselves, so that we can come back stronger.\"",
      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

      "On the military action, Goldberg reported that the account named JD Vance wrote: \"I think we are making a mistake.\"",
      "The vice-president said targeting Houthi forces that are attacking vessels in the Suez Canal serves European interests more than the US, because Europe has more trade running through the canal.",
      "Vance added that his boss was perhaps unaware of how US action could help Europe.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance said. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"",

      "Goldberg reported in his article that spokesman for JD Vance had later sent him a statement underlining that Trump and Vance had had \"subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement\".",
      "Since coming to power, Trump has castigated his European Nato allies, urged them to increase defence spending and generally insisted that Europe needs to take responsibility for protecting its own interests.",
      "Blame for 'free-loading' Europe",
      "Arguments over why the US could - and should - carry out the military strike against the Houthis did not sway Vance.",
      "He said to the defence secretary, \"If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"",
      "Hegseth reciprocated:",
      "\"I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"",
      "A group member, only identified as \"SM\" suggested that after the strike, the US should \"make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return\".",
      "\"If Europe doesn't remunerate, then what?\" he asked.",
      "\"If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return,\" the user continues.",
      "After the strike: Emojis and prayers",

      "The Middle East special envoy, Steve Witkoff, responded with five emojis, Goldberg said: \"two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags\".",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles voiced messages of support, he said.",
      "\"I will say a prayer for victory,\" Vance said as updates on the strikes were given.",
      "Two others members added prayer emojis, Goldberg reported.",
      "Controlling the message: Blame Biden",
      "To Vance's concerns that the action may be seen as going against Trump's message on Europe, the US defence secretary wrote:",
      "\"VP: I understand your concerns \u2013 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS [Trump]. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc).",
      "\"I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2013 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2013 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "The Trump administration has consistently blamed Joe Biden for being too lenient with Iran.",
      "Waltz in the spotlight",
      "Goldberg said he got an unsolicited invitation on the Signal messaging platform on 11 March by an account named Michael Waltz, and was then added to the group chat about Yemen two days later.",
      "The president was not part of this group, but Trump's closest collaborators were.",
      "Goldberg initially thought this was a hoax, but soon realised it was real.",
      "The whole issue is adding pressure on the national security adviser, with Democrats in the House and Senate calling for an urgent inquiry.",
      "When asked on Monday about the whole incident, Trump said he didn't know anything, but he has stood by Waltz.",
      "The defence secretary has also said no secrets were revealed.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans,\" he told journalists."

      "If such information were obtained by American adversaries in advance, it could put lives \u2013 and national foreign policy objectives - at risk.",
      "Fortunately for the Trump administration, a group chat with information about an impending US strike in Yemen among senior national security officials on the encrypted chat app Signal did not fall into the wrong hands.",
      "Unfortunately for the Trump administration, the message thread was observed by an influential political journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg.",

      "LIVE UPDATES: Follow the latest after Signal chat where US officials discussed air strike plans shared with reporter",
      "The Atlantic Magazine editor-in-chief, in an article posted on Monday on his publication's website, says he appears to have been inadvertently added to the chat by White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz.",
      "Members of the group seemed to include Vice-President JD Vance, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, among others.",
      "A National Security Council spokesman told the BBC the text message thread \"appears to be authentic\".",
      "Goldberg says the group debated policy and discussed operational details about the impending US military strike \u2013 conversations that provided a rare near-real-time look at the inner workings of Trump's senior national security team.",
      "\"Amazing job,\" Waltz wrote to the group, just minutes after the US strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen took place on Saturday 15 March.",
      "He followed up with emojis of a US flag, a fist and fire. Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.",
      "These White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.",
      "That an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.",
      "And that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.",
      "\"This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on X.",
      "Democratic congressman Chris Deluzio said in a press statement that the House Armed Services Committee, on which he sits, must conduct a full investigation and hearing on the matter as soon as possible.",
      "\"This is an outrageous national security breach, and heads should roll,\" he said.",
      "Criticism wasn't limited to Democrats, either.",
      "Don Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told the political website Axios that the administration's action was \"unconscionable\".",
      "\"None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,\" he said of Waltz's messaging. \"Russia and China are surely monitoring his unclassified phone.\"",
      "With Republicans in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump's own party would have to initiate any kind of formal congressional investigation into the matter.",
      "Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appeared to downplay such a possibility as he told reporters that the White House had admitted its error.",
      "\"They'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he said. \"I don't know what else you can say about that.\"",
      "Trump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.",
      "The White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz.",
      "By Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.",
      "In its afternoon statement, the White House noted that the strikes were \"highly successful and effective\". That could help minimise some the political fallout from the chat-group discussions, which also revealed some divisions within Trump's national security team.",
      "JD Vance was the highest-ranking participant in the Signal text group that discussed detailed plans about the US military strike on Yemen.",
      "While the vice-president has typically marched in lockstep with Trump in his public comments on foreign policy, in the private discussions he said that he thought the administration was making a \"mistake\" by taking military action.",
      "He noted that the targeted Houthi forces in Yemen posed a larger threat to European shipping, while the danger to American trade was minimal.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"",
      "The vice-president went on to say that he would support what the team decided and \"keep these concerns to myself\".",
      "\"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "This is far from the first time a vice-president has disagreed with their president on matters of foreign policy.",
      "Dick Cheney clashed with George W Bush in the later years of his presidency over handling of the Iraq war, and Joe Biden believed that Barack Obama's covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was too risky.",
      "This is also not the first time that the handling of sensitive national security material has generated headlines. Both Trump and Joe Biden were investigated for their possession of classified information after leaving office. Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for alleged violations related to his refusal to turn over material stored at his Mar-a-Lago residence \u2013 a case that was dropped when Trump won re-election last year.",
      "In 2016, Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for communications while US secretary of state became a major issue during her unsuccessful presidential campaign.",
      "Like this White House group chat, some of those messages provided insight into the inner workings of Clinton's team.",
      "Their revelation also proved to be politically damaging. A handful of her stored messages were later deemed to contain \"top secret\" information.",
      "\"We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified,\" Trump said during that campaign \u2013 one of many attacks on Clinton for what he said was a clear violation of federal law.",
      "On Monday afternoon, Clinton took to social media to posted her own, brief comment on the revelations of the White House group chat on Signal.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-smithsonian-executive-order-improper-ideology/",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:26:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order targeting funding for Smithsonian Institution programs that he says contain \"divisive, race-centered ideology.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"",
      "Under the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \"at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Sex Pistols, the legendary English punk band that helped the underground subculture of the genre to reach mainstream heights, is going on its first North American tour in more than 20 years.",
      "The Pistols last went on a North American tour in 2003, when they were joined by original vocalist\u00a0John Lyndon (formerly Rotten).",
      "The 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 original guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 will hit the road on Sept. 16 at a very memorable stage: The Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas. It was the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones told The Associated Press he recalls having \"pigs' hooves and bottles and whatnot slung at us by cowboys.\"",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \"Live in the U.S.A.\" albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will be released on April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones joked.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3.\u00a0Tickets go on sale\u00a0April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977's \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols Album\" live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\"Why not?\" Jones said.",
      "\"I think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\" Carter said. \"And I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day, we're living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\" he continued. \"Punk is an energetic music. It's one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\"",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band said they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\"The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\" Jones said, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in\u00a0their TV series \"Pistol.\"\u00a0The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\"We wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\"Good luck to him,\" Matlock added. \"I wish he thinks, maybe, 'good luck' to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\"",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\"We're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\" Matlock said. \"And I think that's something that's got a great deal of aplomb that we're going to bring to the public over there.\"",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \"It's early days,\" Jones said. \"Let's see what happens.\"",
      "The band is currently on a world tour taking them to Japan later this month before stops in New Zealand, Australia and across Europe.",

      "The iconic Sundance Film Festival will be moving from Park City, Utah to Boulder, Colorado, starting in 2027, the festival and the Colorado Governor's Office announced on Thursday.",
      "The search for a new host city has been years in the making, with the festival announcing the search in 2023 and several cities, including Boulder, as possible new hosts being announced last year.",
      "\"Colorado is thrilled to welcome the Sundance Film Festival to its new home in Boulder starting in 2027,\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. \"Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator, and important contributor to our thriving culture. Now, with the addition of the iconic Sundance Film Festival, we can expect even more jobs, a huge benefit for our small businesses including stores and restaurants.\"",
      "\"This decision was informed by a detailed evaluation of the key components essential to creating our Festival. During the process, it became clear that Boulder is the ideal location in which to build our Festival's future, marking a key strategic step in its natural evolution,\" Sundance Institute Board Chair  Ebs Burnough said.",
      "The Sundance Film Festival takes place every January. The Boulder Film Festival will likely be pushed back by about a month, officials behind that festival previously told CBS News Colorado.",
      "Utah was home to the international film festival for 42 years, but festival organizers said the festival has outgrown its home.",
      "Since entering the selection process, state and local leaders in Colorado have mounted considerable efforts to get the festival moved to Boulder, citing the city's concentration of artists, its history of culture, and the revenue benefits to the city and state.",
      "\"I founded the Sundance Institute with a commitment to discovering and developing independent artists, with the Sundance Film Festival serving as the platform for stories to help expand audiences and broaden the landscape,\" Robert Redford, Sundance Institute president and founder, said in a statement. \"This move will ensure that the Festival continues its work of risk taking, supporting innovative storytellers, fostering independence, and entertaining and enlightening audiences. I am grateful to the Boulder community for its support, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for the Festival there.\"",
      "As part of Boulder's efforts to attract Sundance, the state legislature is considering up to $34 million in refundable tax credits, which would kick in by 2027, when Sundance is set to relocate here. Some state lawmakers oppose that move, however, with one saying it was unfair to ask the entire state to subsidize what would largely only benefit one community.",
      "Nonetheless, the efforts didn't stop there. City leaders in Boulder previously said that local hotels have already committed to capping room price increases during the 11-day event.",
      "\"Our walkable downtown, iconic venues, and beautiful landscape at the base of the Rocky Mountains sets the stage for the Sundance Film Festival to flourish in its next chapter,\" said Charlene Hoffman, CEO of Visit Boulder. \"It's been a remarkable experience getting to share our vibrant community with the Sundance Institute and we eagerly await the Festival's debut in beautiful Boulder, Colorado with excitement and gratitude.\"",
      "A study by the State of Utah found Sundance had nearly 73,000 attendees in 2024, generating $132 million in economic output, $14 million in tax revenue, and $70 million in wages.",
      "\"Boulder is an art town, tech town, mountain town, and college town. It is a place where the Festival can build and flourish. This is the beginning of a bold, new journey as we invite everyone to be part of our community and to be entertained and inspired,\" the Sundance Institute's acting CEO Amanda Kelso said. \"We can't imagine a better fit than Boulder.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",

    "story": [
      "With stars like Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, maybe it's no wonder \"Othello\" just became the highest-grossing Broadway play ever, pulling in $2.8 million in a single week.",
      "Washington said, \"It's the most excited I've been this century. Seriously. I haven't been this excited about anything I've done as I am about this.\"",
      "That's saying something coming from Washington. Known for roles in films like \"Glory\" and \"Training Day\" (both of which won him Oscars), he's been called the greatest actor of the 21st century. But be careful before you call him a \"Hollywood actor.\"",
      "\"What's the definition of a Hollywood actor?\" he said. \"Myself, I'm from Mt. Vernon, so I'm a 'Mt. Vernon actor.' I don't know what 'Hollywood' means.\"",
      "\"Somebody who's famous on film? A film actor, great success on film?\"",
      "\"I'm a stage actor who does film; it's not the other way around,\" Washington said. \"I did stage first. I learned how to act on stage, not on film. Movies are a filmmaker's medium. You shoot it, and then you're gone and they cut together and add music and do all of that. Theater is an actor's medium. The curtain goes up, nobody can help you.\"",
      "\"Othello\" is the Tony-winner's sixth Broadway show. He plays the title character, Othello, the military commander stirred into a murderous rage after his ensign, Iago, convinces him his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful.",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal plays the deceitful Iago, who seeks revenge on his longtime comrade and commander because he was passed over for a promotion.",
      "Shakespeare wrote \"Othello\" around 1604. But this production sets the play in \"the near future,\" adding modern themes like service members suffering from PTSD.",
      "Washington said, \"People, you know, they ordinarily think, 'Oh yeah, it's about jealousy. And he betrays him.' No, it's about two soldiers who trust each other with their lives.\"",
      "\"Well, then\u2026\" Gyllenhaal laughed.",
      "\"Yeah, what are you so pissed off about? What did I do to you?\" Washington laughed.",
      "\"What you know, you know!\" Gyllenhaal replied. \"But I mean, that what is shared is theirs, you know? And what is shared beyond something that they would share with others. That's what makes their bond so strong.\"",
      "At 44 years old, Gyllenhaal is widely celebrated for the emotional range and intensity he brings to roles, in films such as \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Zodiac\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" And like Washington, he is a theater veteran, with \"Othello\" marking his fourth appearance on Broadway. But this is his first time performing Shakespeare (almost). \"You know what I realized? I did do 'Much Ado About Nothing' in high school,\" he said. \"And I realized that this morning.\"",
      "\"You forgot?\" an astonished Washington laughed.",
      "\"Probably the audience and I would probably like to forget!\"",
      "We visited Gyllenhaal before a performance this past week at the Barrymore Theatre. Standing on stage, the actor said, \"It's my favorite place to be.\"",
      "He explained his character feeds off the audience: \"[Iago] does have a lot of moments [where] he has interactions with the audience, they kind of become his partner in it, and every night it is different. And that's what I love so much about it.\"",
      "Washington, now 70, is no stranger to Shakespeare. On stage he's played Richard III and Julius Caesar, and he has starred in movie versions of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and an adaptation of \"Macbeth.\" \u00a0He first played Othello as a student at Fordham University in New York City.",
      "Asked how he relates to the play and its language differently from when he was 22, Washington replied, \"I know a lot less now. I thought I knew everything then! I didn't really like the part, 'cause I wasn't wise enough to understand it. Now I understand it's really about a bond, you know, that these characters have. He loves not wisely, but too well.\"",
      "\"Othello\" has been staged on Broadway more than 20 times. For most of those performances, Othello was played by a white actor in blackface. That changed in 1943, when Paul Robeson gave a legendary performance in the role. The last actor to play him on Broadway was James Earl Jones, in 1982.",
      "\"James Earl Jones was my northern star when I was in college,\" said Washington. \"He was who I wanted to be. I didn't get to see his Othello, but I know it wasn't as good as my 22-year-old interpretation! But you know, it's my turn.\"",
      "And what a turn it's been. The show is already a box office hit. But record-breaking sales have driven prices sky-high; prime seats go for nearly $1,000, drawing some criticism.",
      "But audiences are showing up, and by the sound of it are enjoying themselves \u2013 as are the stars.",
      "Gyllenhaal said, \"You get to a point where you're like, 'Oh, I've worked my whole career for this, for this moment.'\"",
      "\"That's what it feels like for me, too,\" said Washington. \"I worked my whole career for this moment. This is a 48-year journey for me. It's fascinating to have been too young for the part, and some may say now too old. But 48 years of experience, so 48 years of pain and pleasure and life has informed my approach to playing the role.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Boxer George Foreman (Jan. 10, 1949-March 21, 2025) rose up from poverty in a tough Houston neighborhood to become an Olympic gold medalist at 19, and heavyweight champion of the world twice. An uncommon man with the common touch, he also conquered success outside the ring as an advertising pitchman and star of infomercials.",
      "In 1973, at age 24, Foreman defeated Joe Frazier to become world champion. The following year, he defended his heavyweight title against Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, in one of the most touted boxing matches of all time, \"The Rumble in the Jungle.\" \"I beat him up for the first three rounds, four rounds. I think I even beat him up the sixth round, too,\" Foreman told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2005. \"Then all of a sudden I hit him in the seventh round and he whispered in my ear, `That all you got, George?' Oh, that was all I had. You've heard of the rope-a-dope? Well, here's the dope!\" Ali, then the underdog, won in the eighth round by a knockout; Foreman lost the title.",
      "At the time, he was devastated. \"I was young, only 25 years old. I didn't know what to do. I thought my life was over, because when you lose the championship it's not like you lost the title, you lose yourself, because it's like you're not a man anymore.\"",
      "Three years later, after another loss, Foreman had a religious experience that changed his life. He quit boxing and became an evangelist, preaching first on street corners, then in his own church. He opened the George Foreman Youth and Community Center, a safe place for kids to hang out. \"For 10 years, I didn't even make a fist,\" he said. \"I didn't box, I didn't try to box, I was done with it. I was a preacher, a happy, fat preacher.\"",
      "But money problems drove him back to the ring. So, at 37, Foreman began his comeback. He was ridiculed at first \u2014 too old, too fat, too slow, they said \u2014 but he was also too strong, and in 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out the undefeated Michael Moorer. At age 45, Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion ever.",
      "That same year, Foreman agreed to help market a kitchen grill that few were buying, in exchange for a piece of the company. In the first 15 years, Foreman said they sold 100 million of the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machines and its variations.",
      "\"When you go through the airport some time and people stop and say 'George, we love the grill!' that's greater than them telling me, 'George, you did a good job becoming the heavyweight champ of the world!'\" Foreman said.",
      "And he continued selling, not just grilling machines but also mufflers, chips, hot dogs, video games, home warranties, and a George Foreman clothing line.",
      "\"I'm driven,\" he said in 2005. \"I like the life I'm living, but I'm driven because there's so much more to obtain. I'm one of those guys who's going to have to fall out of the saddle. There's always one more star to reach for and I'm trying to.\"",
      "Married five times, Foreman had 12 children. And yes, he did name all five of his sons George. \"You got Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Kenny Norton, Ron Lyle, you let those people hit you on the head and see how many names you're going to remember \u2014 it would be confusing,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I kept it simple. I never forget a name!\"",
      "It also inspired a children's book he wrote, titled, \"Let George Do It!\""

      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young's \"Rockin in the Free World.\"",

      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \"the Roy Cohn Pavilion\" after one of Trump's mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted\u00a0on his Truth Social social media platform that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",

      "He went on to host \"Late Night\" for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \"The Tonight Show\" back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows.",
      "He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \"Conan O'Brien Must Go,\" drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming.

      "In his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press), former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter recounts the glory days of magazine publishing, and of his stewardship of the trend-setting title for two-and-a-half decades.",
      "Among the colorful highlights Carter writes about from his career at the venerable Cond\u00e9 Nast property is the subterfuge required to protect Vanity Fair's 2015 scoop of Caitlyn Jenner's transition.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Graydon Carter on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" March 23!",
      "\"When the Going Was Good\" by Graydon Carter",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We were always on the lookout for covers that would fly off the newsstands and, in years to come, go viral on the internet. Sometimes the quest took us down unexpected byways. If the unmasking of Deep Throat was the biggest journalistic scoop of my time at Vanity Fair, the biggest scoop with regard to the overall culture was our cover exclusive about Caitlyn Jenner. I remembered Jenner as an Olympic decathlete who as Bruce Jenner had appeared on Wheaties boxes\u2014once among the highest accolades an athlete could aspire to.\u00a0 Jenner was tall and still good-looking\u2014later, with a bit of help from colorists and surgeons. There had been a minor and desultory film career early on, and by the time of transition, Jenner was a stepfather getting ordered about by sundry Kardashians on their reality television show. Jenner had become a slightly tragic figure. But word began to seep out that there was going to be some dramatic news.",
      "One day I called Jane Sarkin into my office and said, \"What about Bruce Jenner?\" There were stories floating about that Jenner was going through reassignment surgery. I said, \"At some point Jenner's going to make an announcement. Why not in Vanity Fair? Why don't you see if we can get it?\" Our initial approach was turned down flat. Then Jenner switched to a public relations person Jane was friends with. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Jane had some news. Jenner was game to do it with us, she said.",
      "To get the cover and the inside pictures and the story, we went into deep-secrecy mode. As we had done with Deep Throat, we set up a special room at the office and covered the windows with kraft paper. Nothing suspicious about that! We had one key for the room, and a computer to handle traffic on a server separate from the one that handled the rest of the magazine. Only eight people in the office knew about the project. I assigned Annie Leibovitz to do the pictures and Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of Friday Night Lights, to do the story. I thought Buzz would be ideal. He could talk sports, and given that he had dabbled with a bit of cross-dressing, he could converse in the language of women's finery as well.\u00a0 Buzz made a number of trips west as Bruce began the process of transition. The plan was that Bruce would have surgery and then recuperate in isolation at his home in Malibu. Our agreement was that no one else was allowed to visit him during this period. Only Buzz. As the reporting progressed, we had issues to contend with, including finding women's clothes for a six-foot, two-inch former athlete and then smuggling the most famous photographer in the world into a house that was surrounded by paparazzi. Word had gotten out about Jenner, and there were even news helicopters circling overhead. We put security guards around the perimeter. And then we put the entire staff for the shoot in two large vans with darkened windows. Jane and Buzz were in one of them, as was Buzz's editor, Dana Brown. Later, Jane described walking in with Annie's team. \"The house looked out at a beautiful vista of Malibu. Very modest house. But a beautiful pool. You walk up the steps, and as I come up, this person is coming towards me in a silk robe with marabou feathers, and kitten heels with marabou feathers. Her legs are glistening with satin oil. The hair is down, and the hands are huge. She says to me, 'Hi, I'm Caitlyn.'\"",
      "Once we had the story and the shoot, it was time to pick the cover and figure out what to say on it. We toyed with any number of options. Finally, I just wrote the line \"Call Me Caitlyn.\" I figured that, by the time the issue hit the \u00a0newsstands, her name would be everywhere, and we wouldn't have to say much more than that. We were still in relatively primitive digital times, but we decided to make it the first cover we ever released online. No waiting around for the printing and binding and delivery trucks\u2014all constant sources of leaks. We prepared a brief description and a short video that had been filmed during the shoot. At noon on the appointed day, we released our story to the world. A dozen or so of us sat at a long borrowed conference table, watching the traffic on a big TV monitor. It started slowly and then, as the minutes clicked by, the graph arm just began to climb until it was completely vertical. I have no idea whether you can \"break\" the internet or not, but if it is possible, we surely came close.",

    "summary": "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, and cofounder of Spy Magazine, Graydon Carter recounts a career as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture in his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good.\"",
    "story": [
      "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, Graydon Carter is a family man, father of five grown children, better known for his signature white hair and urbane elegance, never without a handkerchief \u2013 Herm\u00e8s, he has 30 of them (\"This is my greatest luxury,\" he says) \u2013   chronicler of the privileged set of which he is a member, though not born to it.",
      "Growing up middle class, in Ottawa, he credits a mix of Canadian affability and inner strength for his enduring career at the top of the glittering world of magazines. \"Canadians are not weak,\" he said. \"We may look affable on the outside, but if you can survive playing hockey on an open rink in 30\u00b0 weather, you develop a spine.\"",
      "He tells the story of watching a super liner flitting by: \"And I could see in the light, the sort of the amber light of the window, a very attractive couple, and they were sort of dressed up having, I guess, cocktails or dinner. And I realized I wanted to be on that side of the window rather than this side I was standing on.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before that, would you have described yourself as having driving ambitions?\"",
      "\"No. I had absolutely no ambition whatsoever,\" he replied.",
      "He left college before graduating, but with a passion for magazines, and in 1978, set his sights on New York. It was summer in the city. He was not dressed for success. \"I had a Canadian tweed coat on, and it was about as thick as this chair. And I've never felt heat like this in my entire life. And I was drenched in sweat. Water was squirting out of me! So, I had the interview. But he said, 'Why don't you just sit in front of the air conditioner for a while?' So I sat there for a half an hour \u2026 trying to cool down.\"",
      "He left with a job that launched a career in the golden age of magazines, as he writes in his memoir: \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).",
      "And the timing was golden, too. In 1985, New York City was ripe for satire. \"With the invention of the investment banker, everything changed in New York,\" Carter said. \"People were showing off their money in a big way.\"",
      "He was a cofounder of Spy magazine, cheeky and fearless. Among his subjects: A real estate mogul named Donald Trump. \"I had met him a couple of years before,\" Carter said. \"I'd been assigned to do a story on him. I hung around with him for three weeks, and I wrote the story, and I did point out that he was sort of a sharpy from Queens and he was trying to make it. But I pointed out in the story that his hands appeared to be too small for his body. Well, he hated that.",
      "\"And so, at Spy we came up with funny epithets for people, and in Trump's case we called him a 'short-fingered vulgarian' every time we mentioned his name. And he hated that!\"",
      "And yes, Carter has dual citizenship \u2013 American and Canadian. I asked, \"How does that feel at this point in time?\"",
      "\"Especially in the last month or so, I feel very strongly Canadian, and very proud, and very happy that Mark Carney is the prime minister,\" Carter replied.",
      "The New York Observer was a weekly Manhattan newspaper memorable for the color of paper it was printed on, when Carter saw possibilities, leaving Spy in 1991. \"I thought, 'I can make this a thing.'\"",
      "And in a year, the Observer could be seen in the offices of major editors all over Europe (because Carter had sent them). But a visiting American publisher took note.\u00a0 \"And he comes back thinking, 'This is a huge international hit!'\" laughed Carter.",
      "S.I. Newhouse, head of the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, made Graydon Carter editor of Vanity Fair, where the going was very good indeed. \"I flew the Concord more than 60 times,\" Carter said. \"When you went to another city you had a car and driver. You had a car and driver in New York. It was very heady. But at the same time, it was all predicated on you making a successful magazine.\"",
      "Through the magazine, and his own outsized persona, Carter was often described as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture \u2014 someone making who's who, and saying what's what. He was responsible for bringing Monica Lewinsky back for a reset \u2026 revealing the identity of \"Deep Throat\" \u2026 squiring Diana, Princess of Wales in London \u2026 the worldwide exclusive worldwide introductions of Tom Cruise and his family, and of Caitlyn Jenner.",
      "But Jennifer Aniston was the all-time best-selling cover. \"You look back now, you think, 'What was all the fuss?'\" he said. \"But she had just broken up with Brad Pitt, and this is her talking about him, and crying.\"",
      "A successful magazine is something greater than sum of subscription and newsstand sales. For 31 years, Vanity Fair has been synonymous with Oscar party. Hollywood's party of the year was Graydon Carter's magic. \"It became not how to get people in, but how to keep people out,\" he said.",
      "So, what is it about parties that he is so good at? \"We had no VIP sections,\" he explained. \"Once you got in, everybody's the same. And with a party, it's about the right curation of people.\"",
      "\"Curation is very important to everything you've done,\" I said.",
      "\"If it's interesting to me, I think it might be interesting to others,\" he replied.",
      "Graydon Carter resigned from Vanity Fair in 2017 and retired to the south of France. It didn't take.",
      "His idea of retirement was to start something brand new. \"I wanted to produce something that'd be like a dispatch,\" he said.",
      "Air Mail is an email newsletter. It began six years ago, and is said to have half a million subscribers in 219 countries. Filled with thoughtful features and travel and shopping recommendations (all carefully curated, of course), Carter, at 76, is still finding ways to bring in readers.",
      "The impresario says he has \"stumbled\" a lot along the way. Asked to define \"stumble,\" Carter replied, \"Life is a bone yard of minor mistakes and fumbles.\"",
      "\"I've always felt that introductions would be far more interesting if you skipped the highlights \u2026 it's the lowlights where everything happens,\" I said.",
      "\"100%,\" said Carter. \"Successes are really boring. Failures are much more fascinating.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:33:32 -0400",
    "summary": "More than 2,400 works by the Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, from oil paintings and prints to sculptural mashups, are featured at The Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., which also hosts immersive exhibitions celebrating the Surrealist.",
    "story": [
      "When Mike Wallace interviewed Salvador Dal\u00ed in 1958, the painter seemed to believe that he might live forever. Asked what he believed would happen to him when he died, the Surrealist replied, \"Myself not believe in my death.\"",
      "\"You will not die?\"",
      "\"No, no. Believe in general in death, but in the death of Dal\u00ed? Absolutely no, not.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed did die, in 1989. But in a way, he was right. The artist lives on at the Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "The collection chronicles his career through more than 2,400 of his works, from oil paintings to sculptural mashups to fine jewelry. Inside the Dal\u00ed Dome, a \"Dal\u00ed Alive 360\" show fully immerses visitors in his art.",
      "\"Its spirit is based in Dal\u00ed's,\" said Hank Hine, the executive director of the museum. \"That is, Dal\u00ed was always trying to do things in new ways. The amazing thing about Dal\u00ed is that his impact is still felt today, not only in art, but in culture generally.\"",
      "Today, Salvador Dal\u00ed may be a household name, but his name first belonged to his parents' firstborn son. \"His parents named him after his dead brother,\" said Hine. \"That saddled him with a burden of identity that lasted all his life, and can explain a lot of his art \u2013 for instance, his double images, where you see one thing, and you see another. So, this Salvador Dal\u00ed was always wondering, 'Am I myself or am I the other?'\"",
      "Many of Dal\u00ed's works combine the real and the surreal \u2013 a juxtaposition he could pull off thanks to his training as a precise classical painter. \"He can paint like an old master; however, he wasn't content to stay there,\" said program director Kim Macuare.",
      "She said Dal\u00ed found inspiration by diving deep into the subconscious: \"He was very interested in the writings of the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. And so, when he cuts the drawers into the Venus, what's he's imagining is, 'What would happen if we could go up and open the drawers and look inside someone to see what really makes them tick?'\"",
      "As far as ticking goes, Dal\u00ed's famous painting of melting watches, \"The Persistence of Memory,\" is actually at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But his follow-up is here, hanging in a museum in a state Dal\u00ed never even visited.",
      "The artist had no connection with St. Petersburg, Florida. But what he did have were two very big fans. A wealthy Ohio couple, Eleanor and Reynolds Morse, bought a Dal\u00ed painting to celebrate their first anniversary, a purchase that kicked off a lifetime of collecting and friendship. They acquired everything from Dal\u00ed's early Cubist paintings to his later, larger religious-themed canvases.",
      "Hine said, \"They loved Dal\u00ed so much that they bought only Dal\u00ed for four decades, and were able to put together what is the preeminent collection of Dal\u00ed in the world.\"",
      "When the Morse family decided to donate their collection in the late 1970s, they were insistent that it all go to one location, but no museum stepped up. After the Wall Street Journal wrote an article (\"U.S. Art World Dillydallies Over Dal\u00eds\"), the people of St. Petersburg, Florida, said, \"Well, heck, we'll take it.\" The city made an agreement to find a building for the collection \u2013 a marine warehouse that, in 1982, opened as the Dal\u00ed Museum.",
      "In 2011, the collection moved to its current location, where the Morses' son Brad now comes to see the paintings that once covered his childhood home. \"There was not a square foot or inch even of wall space that wasn't holding a Dal\u00ed painting,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Dal\u00ed's 1956 oil painting \"Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life-Fast Moving)\" hung above Brad Morse's bed.",
      "Now, more than 300,000 visitors a year come to see the fascinating ways in which Dal\u00ed saw the world.",
      "Macuare said, \"Dal\u00ed had a really great quote, and I think it's indicative of how he saw himself and how he saw the world, and that was, 'I don't do drugs. I am drugs.' He thought that seeing as he did would absolutely change your perspective.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed was perceived as an eccentric. Especially in his later life, he was known just as much for his wild persona as he was for his art. But in death his work has gained greater critical appreciation.",
      "\"I think the height of his fame is not over,\" said Hine. \"Dal\u00ed's star is still rising in the world, largely because of what he suggested in his art about the ability to see the world in a different way, something that we really need in this world today.\"",

      "An 8-year-old northern Minnesota boy is one of the first in the country to receive a specific type of gene therapy treatment.",
      "Colton Belluzzo was diagnosed with a form of muscular dystrophy when he was a baby.",
      "The disease has weakened his muscles over time.",
      "But he and his family now have good reason to be optimistic.",
      "\"He's an outgoing little boy. Loves to play outside,\" said Morgan Belluzzo, Colton's mom.",
      "Colton Belluzzo   also loves to fish, ride horses and even give his own weather reports on camera.",
      "But when he was 7 months old, Colton Belluzzo  was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy \u2014 a rare condition that affects 1 in 5,000 children, mostly boys. It weakens muscles over time, and most people with DMD don't live past the age of 30.",
      "\"When it first started, no idea. You didn't even think about it as a possibility,\" said Dan Belluzzo, Colton's dad.",
      "Last year, Colton Belluzzo  got to the point where he had a hard time standing up. That's when his family learned that Dr. Peter Karachunski of M Health Fairview Masonic Children's Hospital had a groundbreaking treatment he wanted to try.",
      "\"Yes, we are optimistic. And it's first such treatment in his class,\" said Karachunski.",
      "In December, doctors essentially placed a copy of the dystrophin gene into a virus, and then injected that virus into Colton Belluzzo's body.",
      "\"This spreads around and gets into the muscle cells,\" said Karachunski.",
      "The virus isn't harmful, but the gene it's carrying is known to put the brakes on the progression of DMD.",
      "The hope is that this therapy slows down Colton Belluzzo's disease, buying time for him to receive other treatments in the future.",
      "\"We were terrified. It's scary,\" said Morgan Belluzzo. \"They are injecting your child with a virus, essentially.\"",
      "But Colton Belluzzo's parents, Morgan and Dan, knew they didn't have many other options.",
      "And so far, the results have been eye-opening. In three months they've watched their son get stronger. He's able to go up and down the stairs on his own. And if Colton Belluzzo   has his way, he'll be playing baseball in no time.",
      "\"Just his energy levels are higher. He can do things. He's playing a lot more,\" said Dan Belluzzo.",
      "\"It's amazing, it's amazing that we were able to make this happen for our child,\" said Morgan Belluzzo.",
      "Karachunski said there are many more muscular dystrophy treatments that are currently in clinical trials that he believes could help Colton Belluzzo   in the future.",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this article featured a headline that mistakenly described Colton Belluzzo as being the first American to receive the treatment outlined in the article. This has been corrected to reflect that he is among the first to receive it.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/disabilities-medicaid-if-buy-in-program/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:34:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:40:28 -0400",
    "summary": "West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill into law this week that bans some artificial dyes as well as two preservatives from foods sold statewide.",
    "story": [
      "West Virginia has outlawed foods that contain\u00a0some artificial dyes\u00a0or other additives, in one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The move cites potentially harmful health effects and comes amid a broader push from scientists and government leaders to clamp down on synthetics in the nation's food supply.",
      "On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed into law a bill that was passed earlier by legislators to eliminate seven artificial dyes \u2014 Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 \u2014\u00a0 from food products and drugs sold in the state. The preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben will also be banned.",
      "The dyes will not be allowed in meals served as part of school nutrition programs starting on Aug. 1 this year, while the dyes and the two preservatives will not be permitted in drugs and food sold in the state starting on Jan. 1, 2028, according to the governor's office.",
      "\"West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there's no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission,\" Morrisey said in a statement, citing the campaign slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he is prioritizing the removal of artificial dyes from food and drinks sold around the United States. \"By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we're taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.\"",
      "The latest ban in West Virginia follows a pair of laws passed in California in recent years to remove some additives from foods sold statewide and synthetic dyes from school meals. Dozens of other U.S. states have introduced legislation to ban or more strictly regulate certain food additives, including artificial dyes, since the beginning of the year, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on food safety.",
      "Thirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S., including nine artificial dyes.",
      "Rising concerns from advocacy groups and scientists about possible health consequences of synthetic food components, particularly for children, prompted the FDA to undertake a new effort in December to review previously approved additives, although the agency's deputy commissioner for human foods warned at the time that budget restrictions might prevent a timely turnaround. In January, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the authorization for one dye, Red 3, to be added to foods, after evidence showed a link between the dye and cancer in laboratory animals.",

      "Stocks are taking a battering on Friday amid growing concerns on Wall Street about the impact of President Trump's tariff regime as well as hotter-than-expected price data, sparking worries that the Federal Reserve is far from declaring victory on inflation.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 758 points, or 1.8%, to 41,541.09 in Friday afternoon trading, while the broad-based S&P 500 shed 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index skidded 2.8%.",
      "Friday's stock market rout comes after Wall Street has already suffered a pummeling this year, with the S&P 500 down 9% from its most recent February high.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a\u00a025% tariff on all vehicles\u00a0and auto parts imported into the U.S., a move that is expected to add thousands of dollars to the cost of many vehicles. He also plans to announce more tariffs on April 2. Because tariffs are import taxes that companies largely pass onto consumers, many economists are forecasting an uptick in inflation later this year.",
      "At the same time, new economic data released on Friday shows that core inflation heated up last month, posing a challenge to the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate.",
      "\"The recent U.S. stock market correction appears to have been partially triggered by investors realising that Trump may follow through with his tariff threats and that this will hurt the U.S. economy,\" said Oxford Economics lead economist Daniel Harenberg and senior economist Kiki Sondh in a Friday report. \"Similarly, consumer sentiment has weakened due to tariff-induced inflation fears.\"",
      "The economy has so far been holding up relatively well, but if it were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called \"stagflation,\" which policymakers in Washington have few good tools to fix.",
      "A report on Friday morning showed that U.S. consumers, including Republicans, Independents and Democrats, getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That's the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that's been the linchpin keeping the U.S. economy solid.",

      "On Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%. Even U.S. automakers selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States.",
      "The rout also hit shares outside the auto industry, with investors concerned that Mr. Trump's trade war may cause U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could lead to sticker shock for American consumers, including for those buying cars manufactured domestically, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\" Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means, a $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmission from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15%-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:07:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"liberation day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump is expected to announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he deems necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement on Wednesday when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "In December 2023, Milton was sentenced to four years in prison after he was convicted of exaggerating claims about his electric vehicle company's production of zero-emission 18-wheel trucks, which prosecutors claimed caused investors to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. Milton's conviction came after a short seller called Hindenburg Research alleged in 2020 that the EV maker had misrepresented its technology.",
      "In his video, Milton said, \"The greatest comeback story in America is about to happen.\"",
      "Nikola filed\u00a0for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February, a move that came months after it warned it could likely run out of cash in early 2025. Once valued at around $30 billion, exceeding the market capitalization of Ford Motor Co., the EV maker was a rising Wall Street star before it became embroiled in scandal.",
      "Last month, Nikola said it plans to to continue limited service and support operations for vehicles on the road, including fueling operations through the end of March, subject to court approval. The company said that it would need to raise more funding to support those types of activities after that time.",

      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",

      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 09:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will again take 100% of a beneficiary's check to recoup overpayments. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "\"The thing is, this administration has said, 'We're going back to the old way, we're getting 100% of the money back going forward,'\" CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS News.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "It's important to keep records of your payments and flag any issues, such as if your check is larger than it previously was, Schlesinger said. \"Unfortunately the onus is on us\" to correct the record, she added.",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Shares of automakers slid ahead of the announcement, with General Motors sinking 3.2% and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram, dropping 3.5%. The Detroit automakers' manufacturing plants and supply chains are spread across North America, so additional tariffs would raise their costs and crimp profits.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and consumer unhappiness over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, fell nearly 6% and are down 33% this year.",
      "Consumers are also likely to feel the sting of additional import duties. New tariffs on U.S. car imports could drive up vehicle costs between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, Anderson Economic Group has estimated.",
      "Beyond the impact on the auto sector, investors have been rattled by President Trump's protectionist trade policies. The U.S. is scheduled to announce a raft of tariffs on April 2, including 25% duties on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with even more sweeping matching levies on a number of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is that Trump remains firmly wedded to a Tariff First policy, his pain threshold is high and there are no voices around him counseling restraint or prudence,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said Wednesday in a note to investors.",
      "He added, \"Even those who might agree with the long-term benefits of tariffs have to acknowledge there will be a multi-quarter period of substantial disruption to the economy, with softer growth and higher inflation.\"",

      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations.

Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money. Raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes. The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion.",

      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",

      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",

      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",

      "When Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA. Still, we are concerned about whether he's truly ready to handle the complexities of such an important public service,\" The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonprofit that advocates for benefits recipients, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Will he fully understand the struggles of many Social Security recipients or connect with their challenges? That remains to be seen,\" TSCL Executive Director Shannon Benton said. \"The key issue is finding the right balance between introducing new ideas and protecting Social Security as an essential public program.\"",
      "After Bisignano was nominated in December, the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy organization founded by the AFL-CIO, also raised questions about his lack of experience dealing with social services for seniors and disabled people.",
      "\"Nothing in Mr. Bisignano's career suggests that he understands the unique needs of older and disabled Americans. His record in the private sector doesn't instill confidence that he will protect beneficiaries from plans to dismantle and replace the SSA workforce with AI chatbots,\" Richard Fiesta, executive director at the Alliance, said in a statement at the time.",

    "summary": "Consumer confidence continues to wane as Americans worry about the economy, jobs and their income.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are increasingly anxious about their financial prospects, with a closely watched gauge of consumer confidence slumping to a 12-year low amid growing concerns about tariffs and inflation.",
      "The Conference Board said\u00a0Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest level since January of 2021. The reading was short of analysts expectations for a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. The business group found that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the threshold of 80, which the Conference Board says can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of U.S. consumers anticipating a recession remains at a nine-month high, the board reported.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has come under a microscope in recent months as investors worry about retail sales and consumer spending \u2014 the engine of the U.S. economy,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in an email. \"If consumer confidence continues to sag, it stands to reason that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP, could also come under pressure.\"",
      "Consumer optimism has \"largely vanished\"",
      "\"Consumers' optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "\"Like the Michigan survey results, this index says that consumers are rattled,\" added Carl Weinburg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, referring to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, which earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low. \"Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" he added.",
      "The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former President Biden's administration said as high inflation dented consumer confidence without undermining growth.",
      "\"I just don't think that there's been a very strong correlation between the confidence data and actual consumer spending in recent years,\" Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"You go out in the street, people are going about their lives, you know, they're getting their paychecks, they're spending their paychecks, the economy is marching on ahead.\"",
      "Yet some of the nation's biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behavior, are telling a different story.",
      "Walmart and others lower profit forecasts",
      "Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation's largest retailer slashed its profit forecast for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025.",
      "Target's sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Macy's, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \"economic uncertainty.\"",
      "Home and car sales decline",
      "The Conference Board's survey showed that demand for both homes and cars has waned. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents' anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased in March. The group said that could reflect a desire to buy before U.S. tariffs kick in, leading to price increases.",
      "While inflation has retreated from the highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. It is also important to note that while inflation isn't at the 9% high we saw in summer 2022, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace. Consumers have seen cumulative price increases above 20% since the inflation crisis began \u2014 higher than their income.",
      "\"Until there's more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable,\" eToro's Kenwell said.",
      "Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays and spent generously. One month later, however, in January, U.S. retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame.",
      "\"Consumers are spooked by headlines about higher tariffs and trade war, DOGE cuts and the stock market sell-off,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a research note. \"When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars, or appliances,\" he added.",
      "Adams predicts a weakening in discretionary consumer spending in the near-term, but sees a potential break in the clouds further ahead if, perhaps in 2026, tariff talk is replaced by tax cuts.",
      "\"If the public conversation turns from spending cuts to tax cut happy talk, consumer sentiment could rebound. But in the meantime, the economy is likely to slow and underperform its growth in 2023 and 2024,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "summary": "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure gave it a \"C\" grade in 2025, up slightly from previous reports.",
    "story": [
      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",

      "The head of the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, resigned Monday after nearly five years in the position, leaving as President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have floated the idea of privatizing mail service.",
      "DeJoy had said last month he planned to step down but hadn't set a date. He leaves an agency with an uncertain future. Mr. Trump has said he is considering putting USPS under the control of the Commerce Department in an attempt to stop losses at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has struggled at times to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail.",
      "Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Mr. Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",
      "DeJoy's tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.",
      "\"I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,\"\u00a0DeJoy said in a statement.",
      "He added that \"much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory.\"",
      "The National Association of Letter Carriers' president, Brian L. Renfroe, said in a statement Monday that the union stands ready to work with whomever the board selects as the next postmaster general.",
      "\"The future of the Postal Service is on the line, and choosing someone with innovative ideas and appreciation for our Constitutionally mandated service is essential,\" Renfroe said.",
      "Earlier this month, DeJoy said he planned to cut 10,000 workers and billions of dollars from the USPS budget and he'd do that working with DOGE, according to a letter sent to members of Congress.",
      "USPS workers, including mail carriers, have gathered over the past week to protest the cuts and the plan they say will dismantle the service.",
      "Critics of the plan fear negative effects of the cuts will be felt across the country. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly, of Virginia, has said in response that turning over the service to DOGE would result in it being undermined and privatized.",
      "DeJoy had introduced in 2021 a 10-year overhaul he has orchestrated\u00a0\u2014 including higher postal rates, slower standard delivery and fewer post offices \u2014 to stem the Postal Service's financial hemorrhaging.

The therapeutics unit works to develop treatments and conducts research into cancer, immune diseases and other conditions.",
      "Data privacy concerns",
      "23andMe's struggles have raised concerns about the privacy of its customers' genetic data, which is used to trace people's ancestry, among other purposes. In filing for bankruptcy protection, the company said there will be no changes to how it manages and protects people's data.",
      "23andMe users must explicitly affirm that the company may share their personal data, although people's data could be included as part of a sale of the company. Some states have passed privacy laws that would require a person's consent before their genetic data is transferred from one entity to another.",
      "In its bankruptcy announcement, 23andMe said any buyer of its assets would have to observe applicable privacy laws for customer data. The company has also previously said that any customer data it shares with other parties is anonymous and can't be traced to individual users.",

      "The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. 23andMe said that, if granted approval in bankruptcy court, the company would solicit bids from potential acquirers over a 45-day period and potentially conduct an auction.",
      "One possible buyer is Wojcicki herself. The executive, who recently submitted an acquisition offer that 23andMe rejected earlier this month, said in a social media post Monday that she may again bid for 23andMe.",
      "\"I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,\" she wrote, adding that continues to believe in the company's brand and business.",
      "\"We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today. There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",

      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., cleared the way for President Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board after district courts had earlier blocked their removals and ordered them reinstated.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit divided 2-1 in agreeing to halt the lower court orders that voided Mr. Trump's firings of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "Wilcox and Harris had argued that their firings violated federal laws that limited their removals only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The Trump administration, meanwhile, defended the terminations and said the restrictions on the president's ability to remove the officials are unconstitutional.",
      "\"The people elected the president to enforce the nation's laws, and a stay serves that purpose by allowing the people's chosen officer to control the executive branch,\" Judge Justin Walker, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, wrote in an opinion siding with the administration.",
      "Wilcox was nominated to the National Labor Relations Board by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024.",
      "Harris was selected to serve on the Merit Systems Protection Board by Biden and confirmed in 2022. She was approved by the Senate as chair last year.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Wilcox received a letter from the president informing her that the labor board had not been operating in a manner consistent with his administration's objectives, and telling her she had been removed. In Harris' case, she received an email in early February from the White House Presidential Personnel Office that stated, \"On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective immediately.\"",
      "Both officials filed lawsuits seeking reinstatement in the federal district court in Washington. District court judges separately ruled in favor of Wilcox and Harris, finding their removals were unlawful and returning them to their roles.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decisions and asked the D.C. Circuit to put them on hold while it considered the matter.",
      "In his concurring opinion, Walker said the district court orders effectively nullify the president's power under Article II to remove executive officials.",
      "\"The people elected the president, not Harris or Wilcox, to execute the nation's laws,\" he said. \"The forcible reinstatement of a presidentially removed principal officer disenfranchises voters by hampering the president's ability to govern during the four short years the people have assigned him the solemn duty of leading the executive branch.\"",
      "Judge Patricia Millet, appointed by former President Barack Obama, dissented from the court's decision to grant a stay.",
      "\"The whole purpose of a stay is to avoid instability and turmoil. But the court's decision today creates them,\" she wrote.",
      "Millett wrote that majority's rationale \"openly calls into question\" the constitutionality of dozens of federal statutes that limit the circumstances for when an official on a multimember board can be removed, from the Federal Reserve to the National Transportation Safety Board to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
      "\"I cannot join a decision that uses a hurried and preliminary first-look ruling by this court to announce a revolution in the law that the Supreme Court has expressly avoided, and to trap in legal limbo millions of employees and employers whom the law says must go to these boards for the resolution of their employment disputes,\" she said.",

      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.",
      "And Greenland's prime minister, M\u00fate Bourup Egede,\u00a0has called the planned visits from U.S. officials \"aggressive.\" And Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland.",
      "Despite this opposition, Mr. Trump said earlier this month in a speech before the joint session of Congress that he had \"a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"",
      "\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has issued executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom agreed to provide more than $100 million in pro bono work for initiatives backed by his administration.",
      "The agreement makes Skadden Arps the second major firm to reach a deal with Mr. Trump amid a recent blitz of executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents. The orders issued by the president have focused on the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale.",
      "All three of those firms have filed federal lawsuits challenging the executive orders as a violation of the First Amendment. A federal judge in Washington blocked parts of Mr. Trump's executive order against Perkins Coie earlier this month.",
      "While Mr. Trump earlier in the month issued an order going after a fourth firm, Paul, Weiss, it was rescinded after the international firm agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services to support causes backed by the administration.",
      "The president said in a statement posted to Truth Social that in addition to providing $100 million in pro bono work, the firm will not engage in \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\" and work with an outside counsel to advise it on employment practices.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Skadden Arps \"will not deny representation to clients, such as members of politically disenfranchised groups, who have not historically received legal representation from major National Law Firms, including in pro bono matters, and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.\"",
      "The White House said Skadden Arps approached the administration \"and declared the Firm's strong commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession.\"",
      "Jeremy London, the firm's executive partner, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Trump that it is \"pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration. We engaged proactively with the President and his team in working together constructively to reach this agreement. The Firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Administration. We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.\"",
      "The executive orders targeting the law firms are among a number of actions taken by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that have gone after his perceived enemies. He revoked the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top Biden administration officials, as well as others who have been critical of him, last week. Mr. Trump also pulled the security details for Dr. Anthony Fauci and retired Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Trump and Biden administrations.",
      "The law firm-related orders take issue with the work they have performed and the lawyers previously on their payrolls. In the directive targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump attacked the firm for representing Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who\u00a0produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "The president's order attacking Jenner & Block singles out the firm for hiring Andrew Weissmann, who worked with former special counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Weissmann left the firm in 2021. It also took issue with Jenner & Block's work on a challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order that seeks to strip federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, among other lawsuits.",

      "Billionaire Elon Musk on Friday clarified his reasons for visiting Wisconsin two days ahead of its hotly contested Supreme Court election\u00a0after deleting a social media post saying he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money will go to people who will be \"spokesmen\" for an online petition against \"activist\" judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "The change in direction came amid calls for an investigation into whether Musk's actions were a felony under Wisconsin law, which prohibits giving anything of value in exchange for a vote.",
      "Musk deleted the post from his social media platform, X, about 12 hours after he initially posted it late Thursday night. He issued the clarification about an hour later.",
      "He had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election\u00a0that will determine ideological control of the court\u00a0in the battleground state.",
      "\"I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote,\" Musk's now-deleted post said. \"This is super important.\"",
      "The Supreme Court race has\u00a0shattered previous spending records for a U.S. judicial election\u00a0and has become a referendum on Musk and the first months of President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Trump, a Republican, endorsed Brad Schimel and hosted a telephone town hall with him on Thursday night.",
      "\"It's a very important race,\" Trump said in brief remarks by phone, in a call organized by Schimel's campaign. \"I know you feel it's local, but it's not. It's really much more than local. The whole country is watching.\"",
      "Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, faces Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in Tuesday's election. Crawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. The retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play.",
      "Musk's political action committee said Friday that it had awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay, for signing its petition protesting against \"activist\" judges. In a video posted on X, Ainsworth encouraged people to sign the petition and \"get out and vote early for Brad Schimel.\"",
      "\"If everyone in the MAGA movement shows up and votes for Brad Schimel, we will win,\" Ainsworth said in the video.",
      "Ainsworth donated $350 to Schimel's campaign this year, campaign finance records show.",
      "Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk's political action committee, declined to say whether Ainsworth was one of the two who would be receiving $1 million on Sunday.",
      "Musk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter\u00a0who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did.",
      "That raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law that makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.",
      "Any legal challenge to Musk's payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former office holders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and the offer of $100 for signing the petition.",
      "The group, in its letter sent Thursday night, said the payments appear to violate the state law against election bribery.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul and Milwaukee County District Attorney Kent Lovern did not immediately return messages Friday seeking comment.",
      "Schimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV.",
      "\"I, frankly, thought, 'Should I sign that petition? I'm against activist judges, but I don't think I should do that,'\" Schimel said.",
      "When asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, \"I don't know what the criteria to get it was.\"",
      "Crawford's campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk's announced visit to Wisconsin a \"last-minute desperate distraction.\"",
      "\"Wisconsinites don't want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk's lackey Brad Schimel,\" he said.",
      "Musk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the White House election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states\u00a0who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.",
      "During last year's presidential race, Philadelphia's district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Musk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million.",
      "Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state.",
      "Crawford and her allies have accused Musk of trying to buy influence on the court given that Tesla's lawsuit could end up before the justices.",
      "The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.",
      "Wisconsin is one of a handful of true battleground states, which only intensifies the focus on court races where rules for voting will be decided. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and 2024 by less than a percentage point, but he lost it in 2020 by a similar margin. Five of the past seven presidential elections in the state have been decided by less than a percentage point.",
      "More than $81 million has been spent on the Supreme Court race so far, obliterating the record for a judicial race in the U.S. of $51 million set in Wisconsin just two years ago, according to Brennan Center tallies.",

    "summary": "President Trump invoked the wartime Aliens Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court orders blocking deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The Justice Department made the request for emergency relief just days after a federal appeals court in Washington declined to let the administration resume the deportations of people believed to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador under the wartime authority.",
      "\"This case presents fundamental questions about who decides how to conduct sensitive national-security-related operations in this country \u2014 the President, through Article II, or the Judiciary, through [temporary restraining orders],\" acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote. \"The Constitution supplies a clear answer: the President. The republic cannot afford a different choice.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has asked lawyers for a group of five Venezuelan nationals who challenged the administration's efforts to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to respond to the Justice Department's request by April 1.",
      "The dispute over President Trump's effort to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants believed to be members of the gang Tren de Aragua has played out amid a host of lawsuits challenging many aspects of his second-term agenda. The request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court is now the sixth made by the Justice Department. Three others are still awaiting action by the justices.",
      "As with the others, the latest bid for intervention by the high court attacks the scope of the order issued by the district judge presiding over the case, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg. But the criticisms of Boasberg by the president and his allies escalated the administration's ongoing tension with the courts. Mr. Trump called for the judge to be impeached after he issued an order that blocked the administration earlier this month from using the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport migrants, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "\"[T]he district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote in her filing with the Supreme Court. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"",
      "The legal battle began earlier this month when the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the deportation of Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of Tren de Aragua prison gang. Mr. Trump claimed in his proclamation that the gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for using the authority, which has only been invoked three times before, and all during times of war.",
      "The president declared that all members of the gang who are in the U.S. unlawfully were \"subject to immediate apprehension, detention and removal.\"",
      "Five Venezuelan nationals who are being held at an immigration detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., on March 15 that sought to stop the administration from removing them under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg agreed to block the removals\u00a0of the five Venezuelans for 14 days. Several hours later, the judge expanded his order to prevent the Trump administration from deporting any migrants believed to be members of Tren de Aragua under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The judge had also told the Justice Department in person during a hearing that any planes carrying people subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation that were going to take off or were already in the air needed to return to the U.S. Planes carrying migrants later landed in El Salvador, raising questions\u00a0about whether the government complied with Boasberg's order.",
      "The Justice Department has argued that it was not bound by the oral directive, though the district court has continued to examine whether the government complied with his order.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the court's two-week ban on deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which issued a 2-1 decision\u00a0Wednesday that declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations.",
      "In the filing with the Supreme Court, Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act gives the president sweeping national-security authority, and she warned that the district court's orders are harming the administration's ability to conduct foreign policy.",
      "\"That order is forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans,\" she argued. \"Those orders \u2014which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "In addition to this case, the Supreme Court is also weighing requests for emergency relief arising from challenges to Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, the mass firings of federal probationary workers\u00a0and the Department of Education's cancellation of teacher preparation grants that purportedly funded diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"",
      "Under the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \"at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"",

    "summary": "A new study shows how cuts to foreign aid could lead to millions of HIV/AIDS deaths and soaring rates of infections, undoing decades of progress against the virus.",
    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to global foreign aid, including slashing programs in the United States, could lead to millions of HIV deaths and soaring rates of infections around the world in the coming years, according to a new study.",
      "Published Wednesday in\u00a0The Lancet HIV journal, the modeling study estimates that by 2030, there could be between 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries and 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults. To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026. The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W.

According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.\"",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798\u200b to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members kicked off a legal battle.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. That order was upheld\u00a0by a federal appeals court on March 26. Two days later, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to lift the lower court orders.",
      "However, on the same day as the March 15 order, three flights carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "White House officials told CBS News last week that 137 of those Venezuelans were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 were removed under what officials described as \"regular\" proceedings under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, including people who allegedly signed deportation papers after crossing the border illegally, officials said.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation without due process.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, whose order has temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will cut 3,500 jobs from the Food and Drug Administration and 2,400 from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to shrink the workforce of the Department of Health and Human Services by nearly a quarter, officials\u00a0announced Thursday, as part of a major restructuring of the department.",
      "Managers in several health agencies are now racing to figure out details on how the reorganization will impact their work.",
      "Trump officials in multiple parts of the department have said they are aiming to implement much of the changes quickly, often within 10 days.",
      "The changes amount to a workforce that will be around 33% smaller than it was at the end of the Biden administration. There were around 92,620 employees at the department in September 2024, according to federal\u00a0records, up from 81,917 at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "Some 10,000 full-time employees will be cut through the layoffs, in addition to other vacant positions that will not be replaced. Thousands of full-time staff have already left the department in recent months, in addition to thousands more contractor and fellowship positions that were also eliminated.",
      "\"When combined with HHS' other efforts, including early retirement and Fork in the Road, the restructuring results in a total downsizing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees,\" the department said in a release, estimating that taxpayers would save $1.8 billion from the changes.",
      "A fact sheet shared with reporters and health officials says that \"no additional cuts are currently planned\" beyond those announced Thursday and in recent weeks.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will cut 3,500 jobs from the Food and Drug Administration, according to the fact sheet. \"This reduction will not affect drug, medical device, or food reviewers, nor will it impact inspectors,\" the fact sheet says of the FDA changes.",
      "At the CDC, the department says the workforce will decline by around 2,400 employees, to \"focus on returning to its core mission of preparing for and respond to epidemics and outbreaks.\" One U.S. official said the cuts are not intended to undermine infectious disease work at the agency.",
      "The administration is also cutting 1,200 jobs from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "From the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the workforce will decline by \"approximately 300 employees, with a focus on reducing minor duplication\" at CMS, which had already been facing hiring limits due to a budget crunch in recent years. The reorganization will not impact Medicare or Medicaid services, it says.",
      "The department's reduction-in-force \"is primarily aimed at administrative positions,\" according to a letter sent Thursday to unions in mutliple HHS agencies, but \"will also target roles in high-cost regions\" and who are \"determined to be redundant or duplicative\" with others.",
      "\"Specific notices to employees may be sent as early as Friday, March 28,\" according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"This will be a painful period for HHS\"",
      "On \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday, Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said these cuts' impact on Americans' health remains to be seen but called the move \"very concerning.\"",
      "\"We're talking about agencies that touch so many parts of Americans' lives,\" she said. \"Will we see more food-borne disease outbreaks? Will we see delays in drug approvals or measures to improve our food supply? Which is, by the way, one of the agenda items for the new HHS secretary. Will we see a slowing in biomedical research?\"",
      "Gounder added China and European countries are already trying to recruit American scientists \u2014 \"Because scientists here are concerned about their job opportunities,\" she said.",
      "\"(These cuts are) very concerning, both in terms of the immediate impacts on health care, public health, and the longer term impacts on whether we will maintain our leadership in the health space,\" Gounder added.",
      "\"The entire federal workforce is downsizing now. So this will be a painful period for HHS,\" Kennedy said in a\u00a0video\u00a0announcement shared Thursday by the department.",
      "The Wall Street Journal\u00a0first reported details of the reorganization.",
      "Health officials had been bracing for steep cuts to be announced this week, as part of the sweeping restructuring architected with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force.",
      "Several health agency officials said they had seen stepped-up security measures coming into work Thursday morning. Managers have largely been in the dark about the changes, officials have said, aside from a handful of changes already announced within the department.",
      "One major change announced earlier this month would result in significantly cutting the number of general counsel offices, shrinking the ranks of the department's attorneys. One health official said the closures would amount to eliminating two-thirds of the HHS regional attorneys.",
      "Kennedy said earlier this week at the White House that the DOGE team headed by billionaire Elon Musk had \"identified extraordinary waste in my department and HHS.\" He cited what they considered duplicated work for communications, procurement, IT and HR departments across 40 operating divisions in HHS.",
      "\"We are with Elon's help eliminating the redundancies,\" Kennedy said Monday.",
      "Creating a new Administration for a Healthy America, and other changes",
      "One of Kennedy's biggest proposed changes is to create a new grouping of agencies called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, which he says will save money and \"radically improve our quality of service.\"",
      "\"We're going to imbue the agency with a clear sense of mission to radically improve the health of Americans and to improve agency morale. We're going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments and agencies while preserving their core functions,\" Kennedy said in the Thursday video.",
      "The new administration will consolidate work from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxc Substances and Disease Registry and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthy \"into a new, unified entity,\" the department said.",
      "This new AHA agency also effectively combines many of Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" priorities under one roof, ranging from this year's update to federal dietary guidelines to public health statements about the use of fluoride. The work will be supported by the U.S. surgeon general, the fact sheet says.",
      "Officials within the Health Resources and Services Administration are expecting deep cuts from the merger, including to the agency's human resources and Provider Relief Bureau staff, two officials said.",
      "HRSA's Provider Relief Bureau had been charged with oversight of aid dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic in the health care industry. More than $1 billion in debts to the federal government could go unrecouped if the team's work is left unfinished, one official said.",
      "\"Our budget was already covered with the original funding and would have been recouped five times over, had we been allowed to do our job,\" the official said.",
      "The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which was elevated into a separate agency under the Biden administration to oversee tasks like the pandemic stockpile, will be absorbed into the CDC.",
      "The two agencies are now scrambling to draw up plans by Saturday on how to merge the two, one health official said.",
      "Work from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which had been bracing for as much as 90% of their staff to be cut by DOGE, will be merged with another agency to create the Office of Strategy.",
      "And the functions from the Administration for Community Living targeted at older adults and people with disabilities will be moved to other agencies, the department said, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Details of who exactly will be cut from the department within the agencies remain unclear, under the new reorganization plans. As of Thursday morning, multiple federal health officials said they had received little guidance from the department, aside from Kennedy's announcement.",
      "In his remarks in the video, Kennedy said that they were \"focused on paring away excess administrators while increasing the number of scientists and frontline health providers\" in the changes.",
      "\"We're going to streamline our agency and eliminate redundancies and invite everyone to align behind a simple, bold mission: I want every HHS employee to wake up every morning asking themselves, 'What can I do to restore American health today,'\" he added.",

      "Washington \u2014 Soon after the revelation that the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic had inadvertently been added to a Signal chat with top Trump administration officials about Yemen attack plans, some of those officials began changing or deleting their Venmo accounts. At least one account remained public for a day after the Atlantic report.",
      "Venmo, an Internet-based mobile payment service owned by PayPal that allows users to send and receive money quickly, also allows the public to view users' contacts if they do not change their privacy settings.",
      "National security experts contend the public information could be exploited by foreign intelligence services or other nefarious actors.",
      "According to screenshots obtained by CBS News, White House national security adviser Michael Waltz's friends list on Venmo was open to the public to view as late as Tuesday \u2014 a day after the Atlantic report about the Signal chat was published. On Wednesday, his account settings were changed to make his contacts private.",
      "Waltz's contacts on Venmo included journalists, government officials, active and retired service members and members of congress. There was no evidence Waltz had sent or received payments on the platform.",
      "Susie Wiles, President Trump's chief of staff, was listed on Waltz's Venmo friends list, but her account is now no longer searchable. On Wednesday, Wired magazine reported on Waltz' and Wiles' Venmo accounts and said their respective accounts were made private after the publication contacted the White House.",
      "\"Venmo is a commonly used app, and Mike Waltz has made necessary updates for his personal privacy protection,\" said NSC spokesman James Hewitt, after being contacted by CBS News Wednesday.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has faced a barrage of criticism this week for sharing details on the Signal chat about the March 15 U.S. strike on Iranian-backed Houthis, had an account in early March, but it has since been deactivated, CBS News has learned.",
      "In February, reporters with The American Prospect, a progressive political and public policy magazine, found that Hegseth's Venmo was previously left open for the public to view contacts he had in his cellphone who also had Venmo accounts. Among the contacts were defense contractors, UnitedHealth executives, fellow veterans and colleagues at Fox News.",
      "The Pentagon has not responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Joe Kent, who is Mr. Trump's nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center, was on the Signal chat as a point of contact for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and his Venmo account was open for the public to view as of Thursday morning.",
      "The office of the director of national intelligence has not replied to a request for comment.",
      "Der Spiegel reported Wednesday that private contact details for Waltz, Gabbard and Hegseth had been leaked online. Reporters from the German news publication were able to find mobile phone numbers, email addresses and even some passwords belonging to the senior Trump officials with most of the numbers and email addresses still in use.",
      "On Wednesday, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in the group chat in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee at a hearing focused on the global security threats facing the United States.",
      "Gabbard acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat. \"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers. On Tuesday, Gabbard and Ratcliffe both said they were not aware of any information that was shared in the chat regarding weapons packages, targets or timing. The Atlantic on Wednesday released more of the texts on those topics after officials on the chat stated repeatedly that nothing disclosed in the Signal group was classified.",
      "The messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Multiple U.S. intelligence officials and members of the U.S. military who have spoken to CBS News this week have all contended that this type of information is always classified, but even if the information was somehow unclassified, it would still be a violation of cybersecurity and operational security protocols.",
      "CBS News on Tuesday published unclassified internal documents from a National Security Agency bulletin warning of vulnerabilities in using the Signal app, even though it is encrypted.

      "But President Trump continues to privately vent his irritation about it and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout is quieting down, according to sources familiar with the matter. The issue is \"still a hot potato,\" one official told CBS News.",
      "Sources said Mr. Trump has been more irritated that Waltz had the phone number for the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, than he was about the use of the Signal app by top national security officials to discuss coming plans for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen. The magazine published its account on Monday.",
      "After Waltz admitted behind closed doors the authenticity of the reporting, White House officials debated whether he should resign, multiple sources said. But in the end, Waltz never made the offer, and Mr. Trump has not asked him to step down, several sources said. Publicly, Mr. Trump signaled his support for Waltz by calling him \"a good man\" who \"learned a lesson.\"",
      "The Signal situation, which Waltz called \"a mistake,\" hasn't been the only snafu for the president's team this week. Mr. Trump on Wednesday evening was unaware that four U.S. military members had gone missing the day before in Lithuania until a reporter asked him about it during an on-camera event in the Oval Office.",
      "The Army soldiers went missing early Tuesday during a military exercise. The Pentagon had publicly released information about the overseas incident at midday Wednesday, but staff hadn't yet told the president.",
      "Asked if he had been briefed, Mr. Trump told the reporter: \"No, I haven't,\" before moving on to the next press question. Mr. Trump typically chooses to not receive daily classified intelligence briefings, unlike past presidents. The search for the soldiers was continuing Thursday.",
      "On Thursday, the White House still hadn't ruled out ousting someone over the Signal incident, sources said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday, the president \"continues to have confidence in his national security team.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump is still unhappy with Waltz, as are some other top White House and Cabinet officials, according to multiple people familiar with their thinking.",
      "Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, sent a letter Thursday asking the acting inspector general for the Defense Department to conduct an inquiry into the incident and brief senators.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Signal group chat that conveyed details of the timing and weapons descriptions of a planned attack against the Houthis in Yemen included the names or initials of 18 Trump officials and, of course, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who published his account of the messages.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Security Council has confirmed that the message thread \"appears to be authentic,\" and none of the reported participants has denied their appearance in the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat. The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services committee have asked the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General to investigate the incident.",
      "So who are the officials whose contacts appear in the Signal chat, and what do they do?",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz",
      "Goldberg said that on Tuesday, March 11, he received a connection request on Signal, from a user identified as Michael Waltz. That turned out to be national security adviser Michael Waltz, a top adviser to the president.",
      "\"Two days later\u2014Thursday\u2014at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group,\" Goldberg wrote. \"It was called the 'Houthi PC small group.'\"",
      "Waltz launched the group's conversation, saying, according to The Atlantic: \"Team \u2013 establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours.\"",
      "As national security adviser, Waltz is a presidential appointee and does not need to be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "President Trump told NBC he still has confidence in Waltz, saying, \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Waltz said\u00a0he took \"full responsibility\" and that he \"built\" the Signal chat group, but he also said he did not have Goldberg's contact information and he didn't know how Goldberg got into the chat. Goldberg said he received a Signal request from a user identified as \"Michael Waltz.\" And soon after, a screenshot Goldberg provided said, \"Michael Waltz added you to the group.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is the official who sent out the times and types of weapons that would be used in the attack ahead of time, according to screenshots of the conversation published by The Atlantic. Neither the White House nor Hegseth has disputed the authenticity of Hegseth's communication, but they have insisted it doesn't constitute \"war plans.\"",
      "As the secretary of defense, Hegseth is the chief defense policy adviser to the president, as well as the second person in the chain of command to Mr. Trump.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, March, 26, President Trump said Hegseth \"did nothing wrong\" and suggested that Hegseth himself could lead a review into whether any of the information should have been classified. \"Sure, I'll ask him to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There are a lot of ways to answer that question. But I'd certainly ask him to take a look at it.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance",
      "Vice President JD Vance also makes an appearance in the group chat, offering his concerns about the operation, such as risking a spike in oil prices. In the chat, Vance's account said he was \"willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,\" while saying \"there is a strong argument for delaying this a month.\"",
      "Since The Atlantic articles published, Vance said Goldberg \"oversold what he had.\"",
      "As vice president, Vance is not only second in line to the presidency, but a key adviser on virtually all matters of domestic and foreign policy to the president.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe's name appears in the chat as well, and he confirmed it was him in testimony before the Senate this week. The Ratcliffe comments in the chat included saying that from a CIA perspective, \"we are mobilizing assets to support now but a delay would not negatively impact us and additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership.\"",
      "In his congressional testimony, Ratcliffe said his \"communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"",
      "\"TG\" \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard",
      "A user called \"TG\" in the Signal chat appears to be Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, The Atlantic reported. In congressional testimony this week, Gabbard did not deny that she was in the message chain, but she said she was \"not directly involved\" in the part of the chat that discussed attack plans.",
      "As the director of national intelligence, Gabbard is a Cabinet-level head of the U.S. intelligence community.",
      "Gabbard testified Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, where she said Signal came pre-installed on government devices.",
      "Special envoy Steve Witkoff",
      "The name Steve Witkoff, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East and Ukraine, also appears in the chat.",
      "Witkoff was in Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin during part of the period leading up to the attack.",
      "Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that Witkoff didn't have his personal device or government phone with him in Moscow, and that he was given access to a \"classified protected server\" by the U.S. government and was \"very careful\" about his communications while in Russia.",
      "In his own social media post Wednesday, Witkoff said he had \"no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "Witkoff had little communication in the chat.",
      "Scott B.",
      "Scott B. appears to be Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, according to The Atlantic. The Scott B. account designated someone from the Treasury Department to be his point of contact for matters related to the strike. The Treasury Department oversees things like sanctions.",
      "White House chief of staff Susie Wiles",
      "The name of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles is a contact in the Signal group, although the screenshots The Atlantic published don't include contributions from Wiles' name.",
      "As the White House chief of staff, Wiles is responsible for managing the president's senior staff as well as overseeing the execution of his agenda.",
      "\"MAR\" \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio",
      "The name \"MAR\" appears twice in the contacts list. The Atlantic points out the secretary of state's full name is Marco Antonio Rubio, and \"MAR\" chimed in on behalf of the State Department.",
      "On Wednesday, Rubio confirmed his presence in the chat, saying he only contributed twice.",
      "\"I can speak to myself for my presence on it \u2014 I think my role on it was just speaking for my role,\" Rubio said. \"I contributed to it twice. I identified my point of contact, which is my chief of staff. And then later on, I think three hours after the White House's official announcements have been made, I congratulated the members of the team.\"",
      "In the chain, \"MAR\" designates Mike Needham, Rubio's counselor and chief of staff, to be the State Department's point of contact. Needham's account does not converse in the chat.",
      "Deputy national security adviser Alex Wong",
      "Alex Wong is Waltz' deputy. In his initial messages, Waltz said Wong was \"pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency chief of staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning.\"",
      "Joe Kent",
      "Mr. Trump tapped former Green Beret Joe Kent to lead the National Counterterrorism Center, and Kent's name appears in the Signal chat. In the chat, Gabbard designated Kent to be the point of contact for her Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "Others",
      "Others included in the Signal chat are identified as Brian, who referred to himself in the chat as \"Brian McCormack for NSC,\" Walker Barrett, Jacob and \"SM,\" who Goldberg reported he believed to be Trump adviser Stephen Miller.",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Mike Needham's account conversed in the Signal chat, but that account did not. The report has been updated.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epa-trump-presidential-exemption-clean-air/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 22:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The EPA announced that it would speed up the process by which industry can bypass provisions of the Clean Air Act by emailing President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "In its latest move to dismantle environmental regulation under the Trump Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday that it would speed up the process by which industry can bypass provisions of the Clean Air Act and other rules designed to limit air pollution with a simple offer: email us for a presidential exemption.",
      "Businesses that would like to avoid complying with certain EPA rules can email the agency with a reason justifying why it should be allowed an exemption and how it is in the best interest of the national security of the United States. According to the EPA website, all emails do not entitle the submitter to an exemption, but the president \"will make a decision\" based on the merits of the request.",
      "The EPA said in a statement to CBS News that section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act \"specifically states that the President may exempt any stationary source 'if the President determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available and that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.'\"",
      "But many in the environmental sector were stunned by the proposal.",
      "\"This section of the Clean Air Act is designed to protect people from exposure to the most toxic chemicals \u2014 the ones that are dangerous in the smallest concentrations,\" environmental law expert Michael Gerrard said in an email. \"It's shocking that EPA is now providing industries with a simple form they can use to get out of these rules and keep on emitting these harmful substances.\"",
      "For years, heavy industry has abided by rules and regulations set by the EPA to comply with the Clean Air Act, which has often led companies to invest heavily in expensive technology to reduce toxic air emissions, an expense critics have often derided as onerous.",
      "So, on March 12, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the \"greatest day of deregulation\" and said the agency was reviewing 31 rules that, he claims, amount to \"trillions of dollars in regulatory costs and hidden taxes.\" The mission of the rollback is to reduce costly regulations that burden the industry. By reviewing the rules, Zeldin said in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that \"As we unleash American energy, revitalize domestic manufacturing, cut costs for families, and restore the rule of law, we do so with the firm belief that America's greatest days lie ahead.\"",
      "The rollbacks were cheered by Republican leaders and industry alike, \"The action taken by the Trump EPA today is exactly what needs to be done to secure American energy dominance and restore the communities who have been negatively impacted by regulations and overreach from the Biden administration,\" Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, said in a statement. Capito is also the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the EPA.",
      "It could take years for the agency to finalize new rules to reduce the costs of environmental compliance, let alone the legal challenges it will face. In an attempt to fast-track this process, the EPA is offering this unique \"hall pass,\" as some describe the presidential exemption, to enable companies to stop complying now, rather than years later when the updated rules are complete.",
      "\"Under Administrator Zeldin, the EPA is now the Environmental Polluter Agency. His invitation for companies to put arsenic and mercury into the air if they claim it enhances 'national security' is a vast abuse of the President's given authority,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, said in a statement to CBS News. Merkley also sits on the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works and its first priority is to review legislation on air pollution.",
      "Merkley's fellow committee member, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, had similar concerns, \"Trump and his puppets at EPA are giving the most toxic polluters carte blanche to poison our air,\" he said in an email to CBS News. \" As corrupt as this is, no one can have any confidence that either the technology or national security standards will be met.\"",
      "Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California and the ranking member of the House Science Committee, said in a statement, \"The idea that some obscure, rarely-used provision of the Clean Air Act empowers EPA to grant sweeping exemptions to polluting companies because they send an email is preposterous. It's clearly illegal \u2014 no doubt there.\"",
      "Environmental law experts believe the policy will be challenged in court. \"I've never seen anything like this before,\" said Mary Nichols, a distinguished counsel for the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA Law School. Nichols says because the statute is so broad, it is subject to abuse. \"I think the likely first lawsuit is a blanket challenge to the entire procedure,\" she said.",
      "CBS News asked the EPA if it could explain how all the emails will be processed and assessed, whether each one will be individually considered by President Trump, and how many emails the agency has already received, but the EPA did not address those questions.",
      "But sending the email request to the EPA does create a paper trail that companies may want to consider. \"This is something that we will fight to make public,\" said Joe Bonfiglio, executive director of the U.S. region of the Environmental Defense Fund, a prominent environmental nonprofit. \"For companies who take advantage of this hall pass, there are organizations like ours who will make sure communities around those facilities know about the requests.\"",
      "Companies have until March 31 to email the EPA with the required information for the president to consider.",

    "summary": "The comments come amid two more high-profile detentions by ICE of a Tufts University student and a University of Alabama student.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that 300 student visas have been revoked, asserting \"we have a right\" to rescind the visas of students who participate in campus protests, despite questions about due process and First Amendment objections.",
      "\"If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason why you're coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we're not going to give you a visa,\" Rubio said. \"If you lie to us and get a visa then enter the United States, and with that visa, participate in that sort of activity, we're going to take away your visa.\"",
      "Rubio continued that if a student then lost his or her visa, \"you're no longer legally in the United States. And we have a right, like every country in the world has a right, to remove you from our country.\"",
      "Rubio said that at least 300 students had their visas revoked. \"We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,\" he said.",
      "It's unclear if these students were notified of the revocations in advance.",
      "Rubio's remarks came in response to a question about\u00a0Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national who was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Massachusetts on Tuesday.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Ozturk had \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. Ozturk was one of four university students who was listed as the author of a March 2024 campus newspaper opinion piece urging Tufts to adopt resolutions from the student government to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" and \"divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\" That article does not mention Hamas.",
      "Ozturk is currently being held at a federal detention facility in Louisiana.",
      "The university said in a statement that she had been returning from a Ramadan iftar dinner when she was detained.\u00a0Surveillance video\u00a0showed she was taken into custody by six ICE agents who appear wearing masks and plain clothes and driving unmarked cars.",
      "A\u00a0University of Alabama doctoral student\u00a0originally from Iran was also taken into custody on Tuesday, according to the university. A search of an ICE database showed the student, Alireza Doroudi, was in custody. It was unclear as of Thursday why he was being detained or where he was being held.",
      "Both Ozturk and Doroudi were in the U.S. on F-1 visas, which allow international students to enter the country to study full-time at American universities.",
      "Labor unions representing university professors on Wednesday filed a lawsuit claiming the detentions of noncitizen students and faculty is a violation of the First Amendment, as is the threat to remove Columbia University's $400 million in federal funds if the university did not make changes.",
      "The lawsuit cites President Trump's March 4 post on social media that those participating in \"illegal protests\" would be arrested, saying that \"under First Amendment doctrine, the category 'illegal protests' is carefully circumscribed.\"",
      "\"Nevertheless, the post did not say how federal officials would identify 'illegal protests' or 'agitators' for purposes of implementing the President's stated policy, nor did it otherwise provide guidance to faculty, students, or administrators seeking to exercise (or allow others to exercise) First Amendment rights while avoiding the risk of imprisonment, deportation, expulsion, arrest, or loss of \"[a]ll\" federal funding,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The high-profile detentions of Ozturk and Doroudi  followed the detention earlier this month of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University grad student who had been active in the 2024 campus pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil is a Palestinian born in Syria with a green card, or legal permanent residency, not a student visa. Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer, said at the time of his detention that an ICE agent said\u00a0they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, but when they were informed that Khalil was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.",
      "After he was taken into custody, the government said it was invoking a rarely used section of U.S. immigration law to justify Khalil's detention and eventual deportation that allows the secretary of state to make noncitizens subject to deportation if he determines their presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "In a court filing earlier this week, the government also alleged that\u00a0Khalil failed to disclose on his immigration forms\u00a0his involvement with UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestine refugees; the Syria office of the British embassy in Beirut; and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "The government also said in the filing that claims by Khalil's attorneys that his detention violated the First Amendment were a \"red herring.\"",
      "Khalil is currently in custody in a federal detention facility in Louisiana.",
      "Rubio said after Khalil was taken into custody that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "When asked on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" if Rubio could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"",

      "Earlier this month, Ontario announced it was adding a 25% surcharge on all electricity exports\u00a0sent to the U.S. That surcharge would have affected consumers and businesses in Michigan, Minnesota and New York, but then Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced Canada would suspend that plan and the Trump administration backed off doubling Canadian steel and aluminum tariffs.",
      "In his latest move, Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. on Wednesday. Experts say targeting imported cars could also strain ties with key trading U.S. partners, including Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Europe. Half of the cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany also major suppliers.",
      "Meanwhile, United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain backed Mr. Trump's imposed tariffs on foreign-made cars, applauding the administration for \"stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 17:20:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, penned a letter seeking an expedited inspector general report on the Signal chat leak.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday requested an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about strikes in Yemen that has stunned Washington in recent days.",
      "Earlier this week, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to the group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen. On Wednesday, a day after top administration officials claimed that \"no war plans\" were discussed, The Atlantic\u00a0published screenshots of more texts that showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided operational details about the timing of the strikes and the weapons and aircraft that would carry them out.",
      "Wicker on Thursday announced a letter had been sent to Steven Stebbins, the acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense, requesting an inquiry into the \"facts and circumstances surrounding the above referenced Signal chat incident, including an accounting of what was communicated and any remedial actions taken as a result.\" The letter also asked for clarity on the Defense Department's policies surrounding employees sharing \"sensitive and non-classified information on non-goverment networks and electronic applications\" and whether this chat violated them.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the Capitol Wednesday, Wicker previewed the committee's path forward. He said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and provide the findings to the committee. The chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth,\" and he noted that the committee wants to determine whether the published transcript is accurate.",
      "Wicker also noted Wednesday to reporters that the information that has been published \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\" Intelligence officials again said in testimony on Wednesday that no information in the chats was classified, an assertion that has been met with intense skepticism from Democrats and former government officials, given the nature of the information that Hegseth disclosed.",
      "Separately, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday ordered the administration officials who were part of the Signal chat to preserve all messages exchanged on the platform from March 11 to March 15 \u2014 the time frame during which the app was used to discuss the strikes in Yemen.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg represented agreement between the Justice Department and American Oversight, a watchdog group that had sued and claimed officials failed to follow federal recordkeeping laws. Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department submitted a declaration from a top lawyer at the Treasury Department who said the messages had been preserved.",
      "\"We're committed to preserving what the agencies have,\" Amber Richer, a Justice Department lawyer, told Boasberg.",
      "She said the department is working with the agencies to determine the records they have and ensure they are maintained as required by law.",
      "The judge, who has faced attacks by the president over his decision in a separate case, told the parties that the government is \"moving toward implementing what the plaintiffs seek.\"",
      "\"What I see here is a real chance to reach common ground on a number of the issues raised,\" Boasberg said.",
      "The Trump administration fired the inspector general at the Defense Department shortly after President Trump took office, part of a broader purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. The Pentagon's IG office is currently being overseen on an acting basis by Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general. Asked whether he had confidence that the Pentagon would comply with his request for an inspector general probe given the vacancy, Wicker said he did.",
      "Wicker said that he and Reed are seeking a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.",
      "\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.",
      "The Mississippi Republican defended the mission at the center of the group chat, saying \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\" He said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from \u2014 and all of us from \u2014 a big success internationally.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Wicker said he did not believe Hegseth should resign. Asked later about any consequences he should face, Wicker said he's \"glad, in this case, no real damage was done.\"",
      "\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"",

I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress to help me deliver Historic Tax Cuts, GREAT Jobs, Record Economic Growth, a Secure Border, Energy Dominance, Peace Through Strength, and much more, so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News reported her nomination was in jeopardy as GOP pressure mounted for her to back away from the position.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News there were ongoing discussions about whether she should withdraw from consideration. Stefanik had not resigned from her seat in Congress, and with the narrow majority in the House, Republicans need all the votes they can muster. House Speaker Mike Johnson was aware of some of the conversations about Stefanik that took place Thursday.",
      "Republicans hold just 218 seats in the House, while Democrats hold 213 seats. There are currently four vacant seats. After the president's announcement, Johnson acknowledged the Republicans' slim majority on social media as he hailed Stefanik's \"selfless decision.\"",
      "\"It is well known Republicans have a razor-thin House majority, and Elise's agreement to withdraw her nomination will allow us to keep one of the toughest, most resolute members of our Conference in place to help drive forward President Trump's America First policies,\" Johnson said on social platform X, calling Stefanik \"a great leader and a devoted patriot.\"",
      "The speaker said he would invite Stefanik to return to the House Republicans' leadership team immediately.",
      "Democrats pounced on the withdrawal, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries noting Mr. Trump's margin of victory in Stefanik's district during November's presidential election.",
      "\"Donald Trump won the Elise Stefanik district by 21 points in November 2024. He withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador because the extremists are afraid they will lose the special election to replace her,\" Jeffries said in a statement. \"The Republican agenda is extremely unpopular, they are crashing the economy in real time and House Republicans are running scared. What happened to their so-called mandate?\"",
      "In the Senate, there was little doubt Stefanik would have the votes to be confirmed. Her nomination was advanced by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 30.",
      "Republicans had discussed waiting to take further action on Stefanik's nomination to see how the Florida special elections go on April 1 for two vacant GOP seats. Both are expected to remain in Republican control.",

      "Stefanik\u00a0has been among President Trump's most faithful allies and was the second nominee he announced for a Senate-confirmed position after the 2024 election. She was elected to Congress in 2014 and rose to House GOP leadership to be the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday visited the high-security El Salvador prison where Venezuelans who the Trump administration alleges are gang members have been held since their removal from the United States. The tour included two crowded cell blocks, the armory and an isolation unit.",
      "Noem's trip to the prison \u2014 where inmates are packed into cells and never allowed outside \u2014 comes as the Trump administration seeks to show it is deporting people it describes as the \"worst of the worst.\"",
      "The Trump administration is arguing in federal court that it was justified in sending the Venezuelans to El Salvador, while activists say officials have sent them to a prison rife with human rights abuses while presenting little evidence that they were part of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "Noem notably dodged questions by the press about if the Venezuelan deportees were going to be in the prison indefinitely and if the Venezuelans could ever be brought back to the U.S. if a court orders the administration to do so.",
      "\"We're going to let the courts play out,\" she told reporters following the visit.",
      "Noem toured an area holding some of the Venezuelans accused of being gang members. In the sweltering building, the men in white T-shirts and shorts stared silently from their cell, then were heard shouting an indiscernible chant when she left.",
      "In a cell block holding Salvadoran prisoners, about a dozen were lined up by guards near the front of their cell and told to remove their T-shirts and face masks. The men were heavily tattooed, some bearing the letters MS, for the Mara Salvatrucha gang, on their chests.",
      "After listening to Salvadoran officials, Noem turned her back to the cell and recorded a video message.",
      "If an immigrant commits a crime, \"this is one of the consequences you could face,\" Noem said. \"First of all, do not come to our country illegally. You will be removed and you will be prosecuted. But know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.\"",
      "Noem also met with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a populist who has gained right-wing admiration in the U.S. due to his crackdown on the country's gangs, despite the democratic and due process implications that have come with it.",
      "\"This unprecedented relationship we have with El Salvador is going to be a model for other countries on how they can work with America,\" Noem said to reporters Wednesday.",
      "Since taking office, Noem has frequently been front and center in efforts to highlight the immigration crackdown. She took part in immigration enforcement operations, rode horses with Border Patrol agents and was the face of a television campaign warning people in the country illegally to self-deport.",
      "Noem's Wednesday visit is part of a three-day trip. She'll also travel to Colombia and Mexico.",
      "The Venezuelans were removed from the U.S. this month after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and said the U.S. was being invaded by the Tren de Aragua gang. The Alien Enemies Act gives the president wartime powers and allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.",
      "An appeals court Wednesday kept in place an order barring the administration from deporting more Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "A central outstanding question about the deportees' status is when and how they could ever be released from the prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, as they are not serving sentences. They no longer appear in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator and have not appeared before a judge in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration refers to them as the \"worst of the worst\" but hasn't identified who was deported or provided evidence that they're gang members.",
      "Relatives of some of the deportees have categorically denied any gang affiliation. The Venezuelan government and a group called the Families of Immigrants Committee in Venezuela hired a lawyer to help free those held in El Salvador. A lawyer for the firm, which currently represents about 30 Venezuelans, said they aren't gang members and have no criminal records.",
      "The U.S. government has acknowledged that many do not have such records.",
      "Flights were in the air March 15 when a federal judge issued a verbal order temporarily barring the deportations and ordered planes to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the judge's verbal directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed and that it couldn't apply to flights that had already left the U.S.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that about 261 people were deported on the flights, including 137 under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Bukele opened the prison in 2023 as he made the Central American country's stark, harsh prisons a trademark of his fight against crime. The facility has eight sprawling pavilions and can hold up to 40,000 inmates. Each cell can fit 65 to 70 prisoners.",
      "Prisoners can't have visitors. There are no workshops or educational programs.",
      "El Salvador hasn't had diplomatic relations with Venezuela since 2019, so the Venezuelans imprisoned there do not have consular support from their government.",
      "Video released by El Salvador's government after the deportees' arrival showed men exiting airplanes onto an airport tarmac lined by officers in riot gear. The men, who had their hands and ankles shackled, struggled to walk as officers pushed their heads down.",
      "They were later shown at the prison kneeling on the ground as their heads were shaved before they changed into the prison's all-white uniform \u2014 knee-length shorts, T-shirt, socks and rubber clogs \u2014 and placed in cells.",
      "For three years, El Salvador has been operating under a state of emergency that suspends fundamental rights as Bukele wages an all-out assault on the country's powerful street gangs. During that time, some 84,000 people have been arrested, accused of gang ties and jailed, often without due process.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he will put a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S., escalating his administration's use of aggressive trade measures in an effort to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",
      "Automaker shares take a hit",
      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",
      "Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts.",
      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",

      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Blunt added, \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President's USMCA agreement.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",

      "The Atlantic on Wednesday posted screenshots and a fuller text chain from the Signal group chat that inadvertently included a journalist, after the White House and top administration officials on the chat claimed no \"war plans\" were discussed.",
      "The screenshots show the timing and targets of the attack on Houthis in Yemen earlier this month were shared by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and discussed in the chat. The White House has stated \u2014 and Cabinet officials testified Tuesday \u2014 the information in the group chat wasn't classified, even though Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg received tactical details before the attack.",
      "At 11:44 a.m. ET on Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted in the chat, in all caps, according to screenshots provided by The Atlantic: \"TEAM UPDATE: TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.\" The ensuing message included the timing of the expected strikes and what type of weapons would be used.",
      "\"This Signal message shows that the U.S. secretary of defense texted a group that included a phone number unknown to him\u2014Goldberg's cellphone\u2014at 11:44 a.m.,\" Goldberg and Shane Harris wrote in The Atlantic. \"This was 31 minutes before the first U.S. warplanes launched, and two hours and one minute before the beginning of a period in which a primary target, the Houthi 'Target Terrorist,' was expected to be killed by these American aircraft.\"",
      "\"If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests\u2014or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media\u2014the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds,\" Goldberg and Harris continued. \"The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic.\"",
      "The White House has not denied the authenticity of the messages, but is sticking with its characterization of the information and continued to attack Goldberg.",
      "\"The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT 'war plans,'\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X Wednesday morning. \"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.\"",
      "\"No locations,\" national security adviser Mike Waltz wrote on X Wednesday morning. \"No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE:\u00a0 President Trump is protecting America and our interests.\"",

      "Vice President JD Vance, who also appeared to be in group chat, posted on social media that Goldberg \"oversold what he had,\" and said the classified information that Goldberg claimed CIA director John Ratcliffe shared was \"the name of his chief of staff.\"",

      "The Atlantic said it asked Trump administration officials and the White House if they objected to publishing the messages in light of their denials that the messages contained classified information or \"war plans.\" Most did not respond, and Leavitt told The Atlantic the administration objected to the release, while insisting there was \"no classified information transmitted in the group chat.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive action to overhaul U.S. elections that would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections and mandate that all ballots be received by Election Day across the country.",
      "The order claims the U.S. has \"not adequately enforced Federal election requirements,\" citing as examples \"prohibit[ing] States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit[ing] non-citizens from registering to vote.\"",
      "The order says the U.S. has failed \"to enforce basic and necessary election protections\" and calls on states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election crimes. The president also threatened to pull federal funding from states where election officials are not in compliance.",
      "David Becker, the CEO of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, characterized the order as a \"federal takeover of the constitutional authority of local and state governments to run elections.\" He said it \"seeks to seize authority over election technology and processes at the state and local level ... all while bypassing congressional approval.\"",
      "If implemented, it could cost state taxpayers tens of billions, he predicted, though Becker, who is a CBS News election law contributor, also expects the executive order to face a difficult road in the courts.",
      "While Congress has the power to regulate voting \u2014 and has done so to pass such laws as the Voting Rights Act \u2014 the Constitution makes clear that states have primary authority to set the \"times, places and manner\" for elections.",
      "Colorado's Democratic secretary of state, Jena Griswold, called the order an \"unlawful\" weaponization of the federal government and said Trump is \"trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.\" And Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the ranking member of the House committee that oversees elections, said the executive order \"is not just misguided \u2014 it is immoral and illegal.\"",
      "The executive branch does have some authority over elections, said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law expert and former White House senior policy adviser during the Biden administration. He said some federal agencies, like the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, provide election support. The commission distributes grant money to states and runs a voluntary certification program for voting systems. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency helps election officials protect their systems.",
      "In 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies to take steps to boost voter registration, which drew\u00a0complaints from Republicans\u00a0who called it federal overreach. Mr. Trump rescinded that order.",
      "Mr. Trump's order calls on the Election Assistance Commission to amend voting system guidelines to protect election integrity. It states that voting systems should not use a ballot that uses a barcode or QR code in the vote counting process. The order also advises the commission to condition funding to states on these new guidelines.",
      "Virtually all in-person voters in Georgia, as well as voters in several other states, use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter's selections and a QR code, a type of barcode, that is read by a scanner to count the votes.",
      "It is not entirely clear how the executive order would affect Georgia and the other jurisdictions that use these machines. Representatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. Raffensperger issued a statement thanking Mr. Trump for the executive order, calling it a \"great first step for election integrity reform nationwide.\"",
      "Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House committee that oversees elections, said the order is a \"welcome action to secure our elections and prevent foreign influence.\"",
      "At least one Democratic attorney on Tuesday threatened legal action. Marc Elias, who has been the subject of Trump's ire, said in a social media post, \"This will not stand. We will sue.\"",
      "The president has long claimed elections were being rigged, even before the results were known. He's battled certain voting methods since he lost the 2020 election to former President Joe Biden, falsely blaming\u00a0widespread fraud for his loss.",

    "story": [
      "Federal health officials said they are cutting $11.4 billion in COVID-19-related funds for state and local public health departments \u2014 money that was largely used for COVID-19 testing, virus research and community health jobs.",
      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The statement said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0expects to recover the money beginning 30 days after termination notices, which began being sent out on Monday. The move was first reported by NBC News.",
      "\"This is just one in a series of many, many cuts we're seeing across health agencies across the country,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said on CBS News 24/7 on Wednesday.",
      "\"This ... is money that had been going to state, local, territorial, tribal health departments across the country, and as we know, as was the case with a lot of COVID funding, it was not just supporting COVID-related programs, but many other things,\" she said, noting wastewater surveillance\u00a0as one example of what's being lost with these cuts, which helps experts look for infectious diseases and other toxins in the water.",
      "\"This has direct applications to the measles outbreak in West Texas right now. It gives us an early warning system for where there might be measles in other areas, where they need to be focusing measles vaccinations, and that program is falling victim to this,\" Gounder said. \"And state (and) local health departments really depend on that CDC money. The CDC functions as a funnel of funding to the state and local level, and in some cases, it's 90% of their budget.\"",
      "Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said much of the funding was set to end soon anyway. \"It's ending in the next six months,\" she said. \"There's no reason \u2014 why rescind it now? It's just cruel and unusual behavior.\"",
      "Minnesota Commissioner of Health Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement, \"We learned yesterday that the federal government has unilaterally terminated approximately $226 million in grants to Minnesota Department of Health related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This termination is effective immediately and impacts ongoing work and contracts. This action was sudden and unexpected.\"",
      "She added, \"It will take time to figure out all of the impacts of this action, but these cuts are a tremendous loss \u2014 made worse by the uncertainty and chaos that our federal partners have introduced into this process.\"",
      "California Department of Public Health Director and State Public Health Officer Dr. Erica Pan said in a statement the department \"received notice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that it intends to immediately end state and local public health funding awarded during COVID-19 that supports respiratory virus monitoring, testing and response, immunizations and vaccines for children, and health disparities efforts.\"",
      "\"This funding supports the public health work and data systems improved during the pandemic that helped California fill gaps in its existing public health infrastructure, including ongoing response to COVID-19 disease and other respiratory and vaccine-preventable diseases that require similar resources,\" Pan said. \"We are working to evaluate the impact of these actions. All Californians deserve to live in healthy and thriving communities, which is the role of public health. CDPH remains committed to seeking the resources required to support the critical, lifesaving infrastructure needed to keep people healthy and protect them against infectious disease, vaccine-preventable diseases and health emergencies.\"",
      "In a related move, more than two dozen COVID-related research grants funded by the National Institutes of Health have been canceled. Earlier this month, the Trump administration shut down ordering from covidtest.gov, the site where Americans could have COVID-19 tests delivered to their mailboxes for no charge.",
      "Although the COVID federal public health emergency has ended, the virus is still killing Americans: 458 people per week on average have died from COVID over the past four weeks,\u00a0according to CDC data.",
      "HHS wouldn't provide many details about how the federal government expects to recover the money from what it called \"impacted recipients.\" But HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in an email: \"The $11.4 billion is undisbursed funds remaining.\"",
      "Freeman said her understanding is that state health departments already had the COVID money.",
      "\"The funding was authorized by Congress, was appropriated by Congress, and it was out the door, basically, into the hands of the grantees\" \u2014 states, she said, which decide how to distribute it locally.",
      "Under both the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, billions of dollars was allocated for COVID response through legislation, including a COVID relief bill and the American Rescue Plan Act.",

      "The change is \"related to ongoing litigation,\" a White House administration official told CBS News. It is not clear which litigation challenging the dismantling of USAID caused DOGE to remove information about canceled contracts from its \"Wall of Receipts\" site. The official did not respond when asked for more information.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, the 3,214 USAID contracts listed on DOGE's website contain no information other than the total contract value and the amount DOGE claims to have saved by canceling them. The canceled USAID contracts represent about 45% of the total number of itemized contracts on DOGE's website, and 57% of the $21.6 billion it claims to have saved from terminated contracts.",
      "Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that DOGE likely violated the constitution when it acted to shutter USAID. The judge's preliminary injunction prevents DOGE from taking further action related to the shutdown of USAID.",
      "The USAID contracts alone total $12.4 billion in alleged savings, though multiple experts in federal contracting have said the method DOGE is using to calculate savings is flawed. DOGE uses the total potential value of a contract, which is often far higher than the actual amount an agency ends up spending, to estimate savings. The actual amount of funding cut as a result of USAID contract terminations is closer to $6.7 billion as of Tuesday, according to an analysis by data analyst Brian Banks.",
      "Multiple news outlets, including CBS News, have also identified errors in DOGE's accounting, with some contracts being double or triple counted. Many of the original errors have been removed but it's not clear if they are still included in the total $103 billion DOGE has claimed to have saved.",

      "With the removal of the USAID contract details, it's unclear what international aid programs the task force is ending.",
      "CBS News obtained a list of over 5,000 terminated USAID grants, awards and contracts, up to date as of March 12. The cancellations included at least $1.39 billion in efforts to fight disease and support global health, including $1.1 billion in fighting malaria.

      "\"If your eyeballs see us together, then I guess your eyeballs are seeing us together,\" Goldberg said of the photos.",
      "Waltz has also suggested that Goldberg somehow added himself to the Signal chat that also included Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 or that some other technical mishap that led to the breach. Goldberg called the claims \"crazy.\"",
      "\"This is what happened on March 11,\" Goldberg continued. \"I got a message request from Michael Waltz. I accepted the message request. That's what happened.\" Signal only allows users to add people to chat groups by phone number, QR code or username of the person they wish to add. The Atlantic story published Wednesday included a screenshot that showed Waltz as administrator and \"JG\" as a member of the group chat, named the \"Houthi PC small group.\"",
      "\"If I'm such a nefarious character,\" Goldberg said, \"why am I in Mike Waltz's phone? Why does he have my phone number? Why is he including me in this chat? And what do you expect a reporter to do when you learn interesting information about the way an administration is contemplating military action? What do they really think is going to happen?\"",
      "Goldberg did not publish the contents of the message thread until more than a week after the Yemen strikes. On Monday, he posted a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat and characterized parts of the conversation about plans to bomb Houthi targets, rather than quoting them directly, citing his concerns that the details were too sensitive to publish. But after the group chat members and President Trump repeatedly denied that the information was classified, Goldberg, after checking with the administration to see if officials wanted anything redacted, published the text messages about the strikes on Wednesday.",
      "The additional messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Goldberg said it's in the public's interest to have the information and be able to judge the incident for themselves.",
      "\"The public has a right to know if there's a massive security breach in the national security apparatus of the United States. There's obvious proof here that national security officials we're talking about real-time intelligence and military information on an open source messaging app that they're not supposed to use for that sort of thing,\" Goldberg said. \"When reporters discover a massive national security breach, it's our duty to tell the public.\"",

    "summary": "NOAA's Office of Space Commerce plays a crucial role in the growing space industry and is tasked with helping to manage satellite traffic to guard against collisions.",
    "story": [
      "Top Democrats on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee are sounding the alarm about cuts to a little-known but rapidly expanding space office within NOAA as part of the hundreds of recent layoffs at the agency.",
      "NOAA's Office of Space Commerce is tasked with helping to manage commercial and military satellite traffic in space to help guard against collisions, as well as licensing and regulating commercial satellite systems. The office has recently gotten attention around Washington as a key government office for commercial space companies.",
      "Its already small team lost eight employees in the initial round of layoffs in late February, representing around 30% of its staff, according to multiple sources. Since then, three staffers in leadership roles were brought back, but lawmakers still worry about the impact.",
      "The members of Congress are calling for all fired employees within the office to be reinstated permanently. Earlier this month, fired employees were placed on administrative leave after their firings were blocked by a federal court ruling.",
      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, obtained by CBS News, lawmakers including the committee's ranking member Zoe Lofgren, of California, say the firings could compromise the office's public safety programs and risk hurting U.S. leadership in space.",
      "They also question whether there's a conflict of interest given Trump adviser and DOGE leader Elon Musk's stake in SpaceX.",
      "\"If OSC is gutted, the harm to America's economy, its national security, and its public safety will leave everyone worse off \u2014 except perhaps for SpaceX, whose size and scale will allow it to mitigate the damage done to the rest of the commercial space sector,\" reads the letter in part.",
      "\"As the largest and most profitable commercial satellite operator, SpaceX has already achieved a size and scale that far surpasses its competitors, thereby positioning the company to withstand market disruptions and uncertainty with much greater ease than its less-established rivals,\" it continues.",
      "In addition to Lofgren, the letter is signed by Democratic House members Valerie Foushee, of North Carolina, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics; and Emilia Sykes, of Ohio, the ranking member of the subcommittee on Investigations & Oversight.",
      "Former NOAA officials also say the steep cuts to the office appear to be at odds with policy goals set out under the first Trump administration to help manage increasing commercial and civil space traffic.",
      "Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who served as acting administrator of NOAA during the first Trump administration, called the cuts \"self-defeating,\" since the office was established to help support a growing commercial space sector. Gallaudet now works as a consultant for space companies.",
      "\"One of our goals, broadly, was to support these growing tech industries. One of them was space, and we grew,\" Gallaudet told CBS News. \"If that office has employees fired, that means it's going to take more time for them to issue licenses to new companies.\"",
      "Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's conservative policy playbook, even called for Republicans to \"elevate\" the Office of Space Commerce, saying the office \"should be the vehicle for a new Administration to set a robust and unified whole-of-government commercial space policy that cements U.S. leadership in one of the most crucial industries of the future.\"",
      "One of the employees who remains on leave, Cole Donovan, served as an international affairs specialist within the Office of Space Commerce. His work focused on regulations and coordination between private space companies in the United States and the European Union.",
      "\"For my division, specifically, we don't have an expert anymore on EU law and EU regulation,\" he said. \"We had been helping U.S. companies navigate that process.\"",
      "Committee Democrats have asked Secretary Lutnick whether impacts to the U.S. space industry were assessed before the firings took place. They also asked whether any communications occurred between SpaceX representatives and officials from the Department of Commerce, NOAA or the Office of Space Commerce.",
      "The lawmakers also want to know whether the Office of Space Commerce will be compelled to grant DOGE access to proprietary data from SpaceX competitors that could potentially be disclosed to Musk and SpaceX.",
      "\"These unprecedented conflicts of interest threaten to destabilize the entire U.S. commercial space sector if they are not immediately addressed,\" they write in the letter.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Commerce, DOGE and NOAA for comment, as well as SpaceX.",

      "Washington \u2014 Soon after the revelation that the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic had inadvertently been added to a Signal chat with top Trump administration officials about Yemen attack plans, some of those officials began changing or deleting their Venmo accounts. At least one account remained public for a day after the Atlantic report.",
      "Venmo, an Internet-based mobile payment service owned by PayPal that allows users to send and receive money quickly, also allows the public to view users' contacts if they do not change their privacy settings.",
      "National security experts contend the public information could be exploited by foreign intelligence services or other nefarious actors.",
      "According to screenshots obtained by CBS News, White House national security adviser Michael Waltz's friends list on Venmo was open to the public to view as late as Tuesday \u2014 a day after the Atlantic report about the Signal chat was published. On Wednesday, his account settings were changed to make his contacts private.",
      "Waltz's contacts on Venmo included journalists, government officials, active and retired service members and members of congress. There was no evidence Waltz had sent or received payments on the platform.",
      "Susie Wiles, President Trump's chief of staff, was listed on Waltz's Venmo friends list, but her account is now no longer searchable. On Wednesday, Wired magazine reported on Waltz' and Wiles' Venmo accounts and said their respective accounts were made private after the publication contacted the White House.",
      "\"Venmo is a commonly used app, and Mike Waltz has made necessary updates for his personal privacy protection,\" said NSC spokesman James Hewitt, after being contacted by CBS News Wednesday.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has faced a barrage of criticism this week for sharing details on the Signal chat about the March 15 U.S. strike on Iranian-backed Houthis, had an account in early March, but it has since been deactivated, CBS News has learned.",
      "In February, reporters with The American Prospect, a progressive political and public policy magazine, found that Hegseth's Venmo was previously left open for the public to view contacts he had in his cellphone who also had Venmo accounts. Among the contacts were defense contractors, UnitedHealth executives, fellow veterans and colleagues at Fox News.",

      "Der Spiegel reported Wednesday that private contact details for Waltz, Gabbard and Hegseth had been leaked online.

      "Gabbard acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat. \"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers. On Tuesday, Gabbard and Ratcliffe both said they were not aware of any information that was shared in the chat regarding weapons packages, targets or timing. The Atlantic on Wednesday released more of the texts on those topics after officials on the chat stated repeatedly that nothing disclosed in the Signal group was classified.",
      "The messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Multiple U.S. intelligence officials and members of the U.S. military who have spoken to CBS News this week have all contended that this type of information is always classified, but even if the information was somehow unclassified, it would still be a violation of cybersecurity and operational security protocols.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., cleared the way for President Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board after district courts had earlier blocked their removals and ordered them reinstated.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit divided 2-1 in agreeing to halt the lower court orders that voided Mr. Trump's firings of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "Wilcox and Harris had argued that their firings violated federal laws that limited their removals only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The Trump administration, meanwhile, defended the terminations and said the restrictions on the president's ability to remove the officials are unconstitutional.",
      "\"The people elected the president to enforce the nation's laws, and a stay serves that purpose by allowing the people's chosen officer to control the executive branch,\" Judge Justin Walker, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, wrote in an opinion siding with the administration.",
      "Wilcox was nominated to the National Labor Relations Board by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024.",
      "Harris was selected to serve on the Merit Systems Protection Board by Biden and confirmed in 2022. She was approved by the Senate as chair last year.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Wilcox received a letter from the president informing her that the labor board had not been operating in a manner consistent with his administration's objectives, and telling her she had been removed. In Harris' case, she received an email in early February from the White House Presidential Personnel Office that stated, \"On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective immediately.\"",
      "Both officials filed lawsuits seeking reinstatement in the federal district court in Washington. District court judges separately ruled in favor of Wilcox and Harris, finding their removals were unlawful and returning them to their roles.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decisions and asked the D.C. Circuit to put them on hold while it considered the matter.",
      "In his concurring opinion, Walker said the district court orders effectively nullify the president's power under Article II to remove executive officials.",
      "\"The people elected the president, not Harris or Wilcox, to execute the nation's laws,\" he said. \"The forcible reinstatement of a presidentially removed principal officer disenfranchises voters by hampering the president's ability to govern during the four short years the people have assigned him the solemn duty of leading the executive branch.\"",
      "Judge Patricia Millet, appointed by former President Barack Obama, dissented from the court's decision to grant a stay.",
      "\"The whole purpose of a stay is to avoid instability and turmoil. But the court's decision today creates them,\" she wrote.",
      "Millett wrote that majority's rationale \"openly calls into question\" the constitutionality of dozens of federal statutes that limit the circumstances for when an official on a multimember board can be removed, from the Federal Reserve to the National Transportation Safety Board to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
      "\"I cannot join a decision that uses a hurried and preliminary first-look ruling by this court to announce a revolution in the law that the Supreme Court has expressly avoided, and to trap in legal limbo millions of employees and employers whom the law says must go to these boards for the resolution of their employment disputes,\" she said.",

    "summary": "A recent poll\u200b shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance\u00a0said Friday during a day trip to a U.S. base in Greenland that the Trump administration doesn't think that \"military force is ever going to be necessary\" there, the same day President Trump said, \"We have to have Greenland.\"",
      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.",
      "And Greenland's prime minister, M\u00fate Bourup Egede,\u00a0has called the planned visits from U.S. officials \"aggressive.\" And Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland.",
      "Despite this opposition, Mr. Trump said earlier this month in a speech before the joint session of Congress that he had \"a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"",
      "\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security.\"",

      "Pabrade, Lithuania\u00a0\u2014 Lithuania's president said Friday that he hoped for \"a miracle\" as he visited the site of a rescue operation to recover four missing U.S. Army soldiers from their submerged vehicle. The four soldiers, assigned to the Army's 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, went missing early Tuesday morning during a maintenance mission to recover another U.S. Army vehicle in the Pabrade training area, near Lithuania's border with Belarus, during a scheduled training missing, the Army has said.",
      "Search and rescue teams were at the scene on Friday using heavy military equipment and excavators to remove silt from the body of water where the vehicle was found on Wednesday.",
      "\"I am still hoping for a miracle,\" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told reporters in Pabrade. \"Although many sceptics would probably say that there is nothing to hope for in these circumstances, I want to believe.\"",
      "In a statement issued Friday, the U.S. Army said the hulking, 70-ton M88 Hercules armored recovery vehicle the missing U.S. soldiers had been operating \"was found submerged approximately 15 feet under a body of water and mud in a boggy area\" connected to a nearby lake.",
      "\"The area around the site is incredibly wet and marshy and doesn't support the weight of the equipment,\" the U.S. Army Europe and Africa's public affairs office said in a statement Friday. \"Draining the area has been slow and difficult due to ground water seepage,\" it said.",
      "\"This will be a long and difficult recovery operation, but we are absolutely committed to bringing our soldiers home,\" said Curtis Taylor, Commanding General of the 1st Armored Division.",
      "The main goal Friday was to remove the mud from the submerged vehicle and identify possible attachment points for extraction, Lithuanian Armed Forces chief General Raimundas Vaiksnoras said.",
      "\"We are working and will continue to work until we can give clear and honest answers to those who need to know the most \u2014 family members,\" Vaiksnoras said on Facebook on Friday.",
      "Lithuania, a NATO and EU member, hosts more than 1,000 American troops stationed on a rotational basis.",
      "The U.S. Army's Europe command said in its statement that a \"large capacity slurry pump, cranes, more than 30 tons of gravel, and subject matter experts from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are just some of the assets that arrived on site to assist with accessing the M88.",
      "The Polish Armed Forces have also volunteered a unit of military engineers, which is moving toward the site.\"",
      "\"We greatly appreciate the Lithuanian president's visit today and the exceptional support we continue to receive from the Lithuanian Army,\" said Taylor of the 1st Armored Division. \"This will be a long and difficult recovery operation, but we are absolutely committed to bringing our soldiers home. I remain incredibly impressed by the discipline, commitment and comradery in this unit as they attempt to recover their missing comrades.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kansas health officials have confirmed 23 measles cases, marking an outbreak for the state as infections in at least 17 states have led to the most cases in the U.S. in a single year since 2019.",
      "The Kansas outbreak is spread across 6 southwest counties, the state's\u00a0Department of Health and Environment\u00a0said Wednesday.",
      "The majority of cases, 20, are individuals who were not vaccinated against the infection. Fifteen cases are in school-aged children, between ages 5 and 17, six patients are 4 years old or younger and two are over 18, officials said.",
      "Health officials in Ohio have also\u00a0reported 10 cases this week.",
      "\"Given the measles activity in Texas, New Mexico, and other states around the country, we're disappointed but not surprised we now have several cases here in Ohio and known exposure in some counties,\" Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said in a news release Tuesday.",
      "Measles, a highly contagious infectious disease, can in some cases cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that may lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death.\u00a0A vaccine\u00a0against the illness is safe and effective, doctors and health officials say.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "So far, no cases in Kansas have led to hospitalization or death, according to the data from the state's health department.",
      "The Kansas cases come as other states are facing rising infections too. The majority of the cases have been reported in an outbreak in Texas that has sickened more than 400 people since late January and has caused the death of a child. An adult with measles also\u00a0died in New Mexico.",
      "Earlier this month, a person with a confirmed measles infection may have exposed Amtrak passengers on a train to Washington, D.C., according to officials at the\u00a0D.C. Department of Health.",
      "Measles cases have also been reported in a number of other states, including\u00a0New Jersey, Georgia,\u00a0California, Rhode Island, Kentucky,\u00a0Michigan, Alaska and Pennsylvania.",
      "The measles vaccine is usually administered in childhood as part of the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, shot. Two doses are about 97% effective at preventing measles, and a single dose is about 93% effective, the CDC says.",
      "Similar to the Kansas cases, the Texas outbreak largely spread in a community with very low vaccination rates, and Texas health officials said the child who died in that outbreak was unvaccinated.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom agreed to provide more than $100 million in pro bono work for initiatives backed by his administration.",
      "The agreement makes Skadden Arps the second major firm to reach a deal with Mr. Trump amid a recent blitz of executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents. The orders issued by the president have focused on the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale.",
      "All three of those firms have filed federal lawsuits challenging the executive orders as a violation of the First Amendment. A federal judge in Washington blocked parts of Mr. Trump's executive order against Perkins Coie earlier this month.",
      "While Mr. Trump earlier in the month issued an order going after a fourth firm, Paul, Weiss, it was rescinded after the international firm agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services to support causes backed by the administration.",
      "The president said in a statement posted to Truth Social that in addition to providing $100 million in pro bono work, the firm will not engage in \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\" and work with an outside counsel to advise it on employment practices.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Skadden Arps \"will not deny representation to clients, such as members of politically disenfranchised groups, who have not historically received legal representation from major National Law Firms, including in pro bono matters, and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.\"",
      "The White House said Skadden Arps approached the administration \"and declared the Firm's strong commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession.\"",
      "Jeremy London, the firm's executive partner, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Trump that it is \"pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration. We engaged proactively with the President and his team in working together constructively to reach this agreement. The Firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Administration. We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.\"",
      "The executive orders targeting the law firms are among a number of actions taken by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that have gone after his perceived enemies. He revoked the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top Biden administration officials, as well as others who have been critical of him, last week. Mr. Trump also pulled the security details for Dr. Anthony Fauci and retired Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Trump and Biden administrations.",
      "The law firm-related orders take issue with the work they have performed and the lawyers previously on their payrolls. In the directive targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump attacked the firm for representing Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who\u00a0produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "The president's order attacking Jenner & Block singles out the firm for hiring Andrew Weissmann, who worked with former special counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Weissmann left the firm in 2021. It also took issue with Jenner & Block's work on a challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order that seeks to strip federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, among other lawsuits.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks are taking a battering on Friday amid growing concerns on Wall Street about the impact of President Trump's tariff regime as well as hotter-than-expected price data, sparking worries that the Federal Reserve is far from declaring victory on inflation.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 758 points, or 1.8%, to 41,541.09 in Friday afternoon trading, while the broad-based S&P 500 shed 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index skidded 2.8%.",
      "Friday's stock market rout comes after Wall Street has already suffered a pummeling this year, with the S&P 500 down 9% from its most recent February high.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a\u00a025% tariff on all vehicles\u00a0and auto parts imported into the U.S., a move that is expected to add thousands of dollars to the cost of many vehicles. He also plans to announce more tariffs on April 2. Because tariffs are import taxes that companies largely pass onto consumers, many economists are forecasting an uptick in inflation later this year.",
      "At the same time, new economic data released on Friday shows that core inflation heated up last month, posing a challenge to the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate.",
      "\"The recent U.S. stock market correction appears to have been partially triggered by investors realising that Trump may follow through with his tariff threats and that this will hurt the U.S. economy,\" said Oxford Economics lead economist Daniel Harenberg and senior economist Kiki Sondh in a Friday report. \"Similarly, consumer sentiment has weakened due to tariff-induced inflation fears.\"",
      "The economy has so far been holding up relatively well, but if it were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called \"stagflation,\" which policymakers in Washington have few good tools to fix.",
      "A report on Friday morning showed that U.S. consumers, including Republicans, Independents and Democrats, getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That's the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that's been the linchpin keeping the U.S. economy solid.",
      "At the same time, recent CBS News polling shows that Americans have become more dour in their economic outlooks, with relatively more consumers bracing for a slowdown or\u00a0recession\u00a0over the next year.",

      "Shares of automakers tumbled on Friday, continuing a rout that began after Mr. Trump announced his new auto tariffs.\u00a0Hyundai Motor fell 2.6% in Seoul, while Honda Motor fell 2.6%, and Toyota Motor sank 2.8% in Tokyo.",
      "On Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%. Even U.S. automakers selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States.",
      "The rout also hit shares outside the auto industry, with investors concerned that Mr. Trump's trade war may cause U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurt the economy.",
      "Leading the market lower on Friday was Lululemon Athletica, which dropped 15%. Even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, it warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year as consumers grow more cautious.",
      "\"Consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,\" said CEO Calvin McDonald.",
      "Lululemon also said tariffs and shifting foreign-currency values may account for about half of its expected drop in a key measure of performance: how much profit it can squeeze out of each $1 of revenue.",
      "Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 3.1%.

After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "The change in direction came amid calls for an investigation into whether Musk's actions were a felony under Wisconsin law, which prohibits giving anything of value in exchange for a vote.",
      "Musk deleted the post from his social media platform, X, about 12 hours after he initially posted it late Thursday night. He issued the clarification about an hour later.",
      "He had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election\u00a0that will determine ideological control of the court\u00a0in the battleground state.",

Crawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. The retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play.",
      "Musk's political action committee said Friday that it had awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay, for signing its petition protesting against \"activist\" judges. In a video posted on X, Ainsworth encouraged people to sign the petition and \"get out and vote early for Brad Schimel.\"",

      "Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk's political action committee, declined to say whether Ainsworth was one of the two who would be receiving $1 million on Sunday.",
      "Musk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter\u00a0who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did.",
      "That raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law that makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.",
      "Any legal challenge to Musk's payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former office holders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and the offer of $100 for signing the petition.",
      "The group, in its letter sent Thursday night, said the payments appear to violate the state law against election bribery.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul and Milwaukee County District Attorney Kent Lovern did not immediately return messages Friday seeking comment.",

      "\"I, frankly, thought, 'Should I sign that petition? I'm against activist judges, but I don't think I should do that,'\" Schimel said.",
      "When asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, \"I don't know what the criteria to get it was.\"",
      "Crawford's campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk's announced visit to Wisconsin a \"last-minute desperate distraction.\"",
      "\"Wisconsinites don't want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk's lackey Brad Schimel,\" he said.",

      "Just three months into 2025, the United States has recorded the most measles cases in a single year since a 2019 wave, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. The majority of the infections have been reported in an outbreak in West Texas that has led to\u00a0the death of a child. The number of cases in Texas alone hit 400 and continues to rise.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in a number of other states around the country as well.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide, updating this page as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The CDC releases its latest weekly numbers on Fridays.)",
      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. was in 2019 when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a\u00a0noted vaccine skeptic, voiced support for the measles vaccine in early March amid the\u00a0deadly outbreak\u00a0in the Southwest, after previously downplaying the growing cases and making numerous false and misleading claims about the safety of the MMR vaccine.",

      "Since 1921, when the National Park Service began recording the dates, peak blooms have shifted earlier by about eight days, the Environmental Protection Agency says.",
      "Where to see the D.C. cherry blossoms",
      "The most famous place to see the cherry blossoms in the nation's capital is around the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park. Many cherry trees are also along a section of the Potomac River and Washington Channel in East Potomac Park.",
      "This year, construction that began in August 2024 to replace seawalls along the Potomac River and part of the Tidal Basin could affect the viewing of some of the cherry trees. The work is expected to last through 2026.",
      "However, there are many other cherry trees throughout Washington, D.C. Casey Trees, a nonprofit that plants and cares for trees in the city, provides a map of where to see the blossoms across Washington. The map does not include trees on private property, the organization said.",
      "How long will the cherry blossoms last in D.C.?",
      "The Yoshino cherry trees usually bloom for several days, the National Park Service said, but weather conditions will affect the length of time.",
      "\"Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms,\" the agency said on its website. \"A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\"",
      "Why does D.C. have cherry blossoms?",
      "Japan gifted more than 3,000 cherry trees to the United States in 1912 as a symbol of friendship.",
      "That year, first lady Helen Herron Taft and the wife of the Japanese ambassador, Viscountess Chinda Iwa, planted two of the Yoshino cherry trees along the Tidal Basin, the National Park Service notes in a history of the trees. In the next few years, the trees continued to be planted around the basin and other areas.",
      "But the idea to plant Japanese cherry trees in the U.S. capital was raised as early as 1885 by a woman named Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, a writer and diplomat, according to the National Park Service.",
      "Despite her first request to the U.S. Army Superintendent of the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds not going anywhere, she continued to ask and eventually wrote to Herron Taft, who helped bring the idea to life, the agency says.",

    "summary": "President Trump invoked the wartime Aliens Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court orders blocking deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The Justice Department made the request for emergency relief just days after a federal appeals court in Washington declined to let the administration resume the deportations of people believed to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador under the wartime authority.",
      "\"This case presents fundamental questions about who decides how to conduct sensitive national-security-related operations in this country \u2014 the President, through Article II, or the Judiciary, through [temporary restraining orders],\" acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote. \"The Constitution supplies a clear answer: the President. The republic cannot afford a different choice.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has asked lawyers for a group of five Venezuelan nationals who challenged the administration's efforts to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to respond to the Justice Department's request by April 1.",
      "The dispute over President Trump's effort to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants believed to be members of the gang Tren de Aragua has played out amid a host of lawsuits challenging many aspects of his second-term agenda. The request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court is now the sixth made by the Justice Department. Three others are still awaiting action by the justices.",
      "As with the others, the latest bid for intervention by the high court attacks the scope of the order issued by the district judge presiding over the case, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg. But the criticisms of Boasberg by the president and his allies escalated the administration's ongoing tension with the courts. Mr. Trump called for the judge to be impeached after he issued an order that blocked the administration earlier this month from using the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport migrants, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "\"[T]he district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote in her filing with the Supreme Court. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"",
      "The legal battle began earlier this month when the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the deportation of Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of Tren de Aragua prison gang. Mr. Trump claimed in his proclamation that the gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for using the authority, which has only been invoked three times before, and all during times of war.",
      "The president declared that all members of the gang who are in the U.S. unlawfully were \"subject to immediate apprehension, detention and removal.\"",
      "Five Venezuelan nationals who are being held at an immigration detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., on March 15 that sought to stop the administration from removing them under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg agreed to block the removals\u00a0of the five Venezuelans for 14 days. Several hours later, the judge expanded his order to prevent the Trump administration from deporting any migrants believed to be members of Tren de Aragua under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The judge had also told the Justice Department in person during a hearing that any planes carrying people subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation that were going to take off or were already in the air needed to return to the U.S. Planes carrying migrants later landed in El Salvador, raising questions\u00a0about whether the government complied with Boasberg's order.",
      "The Justice Department has argued that it was not bound by the oral directive, though the district court has continued to examine whether the government complied with his order.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the court's two-week ban on deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which issued a 2-1 decision\u00a0Wednesday that declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations.",
      "In the filing with the Supreme Court, Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act gives the president sweeping national-security authority, and she warned that the district court's orders are harming the administration's ability to conduct foreign policy.",
      "\"That order is forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans,\" she argued. \"Those orders \u2014which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "In addition to this case, the Supreme Court is also weighing requests for emergency relief arising from challenges to Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, the mass firings of federal probationary workers\u00a0and the Department of Education's cancellation of teacher preparation grants that purportedly funded diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order targeting funding for Smithsonian Institution programs that he says contain \"divisive, race-centered ideology.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"",
      "Under the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \"at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"",

It was the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones told The Associated Press he recalls having \"pigs' hooves and bottles and whatnot slung at us by cowboys.\"",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \"Live in the U.S.A.\" albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will be released on April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones joked.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles.

      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\"Why not?\" Jones said.",
      "\"I think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\" Carter said. \"And I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day, we're living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\" he continued. \"Punk is an energetic music. It's one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\"",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band said they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\"The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\" Jones said, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in\u00a0their TV series \"Pistol.\"\u00a0The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\"We wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\"Good luck to him,\" Matlock added. \"I wish he thinks, maybe, 'good luck' to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\"",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\"We're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\" Matlock said. \"And I think that's something that's got a great deal of aplomb that we're going to bring to the public over there.\"",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \"It's early days,\" Jones said. \"Let's see what happens.\"",

      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump repeated vows to secure U.S. control of Greenland and the Panama Canal in his speech to a joint a session of Congress\u00a0on March 4.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security and even international security,\" the president said during his address. \"I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"",
      "Greenland's prime minister responded: \"We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"",
      "A few weeks later, Vice President JD Vance and second lady\u00a0Usha Vance\u00a0paid a\u00a0visit to Greenland\u00a0along with\u00a0national security adviser Mike Waltz.\u00a0Donald Trump Jr. visited in January\u00a0before the president took office.",
      "On the Panama Canal, Mr. Trump said in his March 4 address, \"To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it,\" referring to a deal to give an American company control of key ports.",
      "Panama's president denounced Mr. Trump's remarks and said \"The Canal is Panamanian\" in a social media post.",
      "Below is a look at where the two places are and what Mr. Trump has said about wanting the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why does President Trump want it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada. The largest island in the world, it is about 836,000 square miles, around the size of Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to only around 60,000 people. It is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark and has its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world,\" he said in early January. \"You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Mr. Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Inside the Vances' Greenland visit",
      "Usha Vance was originally supposed to visit Greenland solo in late March as part of an expanded cultural trip, but then the vice president announced he would join her.",
      "The Vances arrived along with national security adviser Mike Waltz on Friday, March 28, to spend the day at Pituffik Space Base, the United States' northernmost military installation. The base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, is locked in by ice for much of the year, according to its website, but operates its airfield year-round.",
      "They met with service members at the base and received a briefing on Arctic security issues.",
      "\"As you've heard, we have some interest in Greenland from the Trump administration,\" the vice president told a group of service members at the dining hall.",
      "Vance said Mr. Trump wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "While announcing his visit, Vance said \"a lot of other countries\" pose\u00a0a threat to Greenland and its waterways, and would use them to threaten the U.S.",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said in a video message before his trip. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "A\u00a0recent poll showed\u00a0that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" he said before taking office again on Jan. 20.",
      "Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China controls the canal.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "But in February, Panama decided not to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing after a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Ahead of Mr. Trump's address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by American company BlackRock.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,\" he said.",
      "In his response, Mulino said, \"President Trump is lying.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" he wrote on social media. \"The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!\"",
      "China has denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",
      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",
      "In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

    "story": [
      "Bangkok \u2014 Two violent earthquakes rocked Southeast Asia on Friday, killing at least 144 people in Myanmar, according to the country's military rulers. At least 10 people died in Thailand's capital Bangkok, where a high-rise building that was under construction collapsed, leaving dozens more missing under the rubble.",
      "A state of emergency was declared in Bangkok and in six regions and states in neighboring Myanmar, including its capital Naypyitaw. The head of Myanmar's ruling junta said in the televised speech Friday evening that at least 144 people were killed and 730 others injured in the disaster, and he appealed for international help.",
      "\"The death toll and injuries are expected to rise,\" Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said.",
      "A hospital in the Naypyitaw was struggling to deal with mass casualties after sustaining serious damage in the quake.",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey and Germany's GFZ center for geosciences said the first quake had a magnitude of 7.7 and was at the relatively shallow depth of about 6 miles. Its epicenter was in Myanmar, according to preliminary reports, near the city of Mandalay. An aftershock with a magnitude of 6.4 shook the region 12 minutes later.",
      "Destruction in Myanmar",
      "Myanmar is in the midst of a civil war and many areas are not easily accessible. Photos from Naypyidaw showed multiple buildings used to house civil servants destroyed by the quake, and rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble.",
      "The government said blood was in high demand in the hardest-hit areas. Images of buckled and cracked roads in Mandalay and damaged highways as well as the collapse of a bridge and dam raised further concerns about how rescuers would even reach some areas in a country already enduring a widespread humanitarian crisis.",
      "It was not immediately clear what relief efforts the ruling military regime would be able to provide, but it issued appeals for any help available, including blood supplies, from the international community. The major hospital in the country's capital that sustained significant damage was described as a mass casualty area, as medics raced to treat the wounded in an outdoor triage area.",
      "The hospital's emergency department was heavily damaged, and images showed a car crushed under the concrete roof that had covered its entrance.",
      "\"Many injured people have been arriving, I haven't seen anything like this before,\" a doctor at the facility told AFP. \"We are trying to handle the situation. I'm so exhausted.\"",
      "AFP journalists at the scene said people were crying in pain and others lay still as relatives tried to offer comfort.",
      "\"Hundreds of injured people are arriving... but the emergency building here also collapsed,\" security officials at the hospital told AFP.",
      "The powerful temblor damaged part of the former royal palace in Mandalay and other buildings, according to videos and photos posted to social media.",
      "In the Sagaing region just southwest of Mandalay, a 90-year-old bridge collapsed, and some sections of the highway connecting Mandalay and Myanmar's largest city, Yangon, were also damaged.",
      "A team of AFP journalists was at the National Museum in Naypyidaw when the first temblor hit, and they said pieces fell from the ceiling as the building began shaking, and nearby roads buckled.",
      "Under-construction skyscraper collapses in Bangkok",
      "In densely populated Bangkok, city authorities said 10 people were killed, 16 injured and 101 missing from three construction sites, including the collapsed high-rise. The quakes set tall buildings swaying and prompted thousands of people to pour into streets across the city. Trading was halted on the stock exchange and public transport networks shut down in the Thai capital.",
      "The collapsed building was being constructed by the China Railway Construction Corporation for Thailand's government auditor general.",
      "Videos posted on social media showed the moment the 33-story high-rise came tumbling down, sending a massive cloud of dust into the air as workers ran away from the site.",
      "Rescue worker Songwut Wangpon told reporters that seven people were found alive, as he spoke next to the tall pile of rubble that was once the unfinished building near Bangkok's popular Chatuchak Market.",
      "Water from high-rise rooftop pools in Bangkok sloshed over the sides of the buildings as they shook from the first quake, and debris fell from many skyscrapers.",
      "Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra called an emergency meeting to assess the impact of the temblors.",
      "The greater Bangkok area is home to more than 17 million people, many of whom live in high-rise apartments.",
      "Alarms went off in buildings when the first quake hit around 1:30 p.m., and startled residents were evacuated down staircases of high-rise condominiums and hotels in densely populated central Bangkok.",
      "They remained in the streets, seeking shade from the midday sun in the minutes after the first quake, and were cautioned to stay outside in case there were more aftershocks.",
      "\"All of a sudden the whole building began to move, immediately there was screaming and a lot of panic,\" said Fraser Morton, a tourist from Scotland, who was in one of Bangkok's many malls shopping for camera equipment.",
      "\"I just started walking calmly at first but then the building started really moving, yeah, a lot of screaming, a lot of panic, people running the wrong way down the escalators, lots of banging and crashing inside the mall.\"",
      "Like thousands of others in downtown Bangkok, Morton sought refuge in Benjasiri Park \u2014 away from the tall buildings all around.",
      "\"I got outside and then looked up at the building and the whole building was moving, dust and debris, it was pretty intense,\" he said. \"Lots of chaos.\"",

    "story": [
      "Beirut, Lebanon \u2014\u00a0Israel has launched an attack on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, for the first time since a fragile ceasefire ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in November. Associated Press reporters in Beirut heard a loud boom and witnessed smoke rising from the area that Israel's military had warned it would strike.",
      "The strike came after Israel's army urgently warned people to evacuate parts of a Beirut suburb, vowing to retaliate against strikes which it said were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel. Israel's defense minister said Friday that if there was no peace in Israel's northern communities there would be no peace in Beirut either.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said the strike in Beirut had targeted a Hezbollah drone storage facility in the Dahiyeh neighborhood, which Israel has long described as a key Hezbollah stronghold. Israel accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields and the IDF noted its advanced warning for people to leave the area on Friday.",
      "Hezbollah denied firing the rockets at northern Israel, and accused Israel of seeking a pretext to continue attacking Lebanon.",
      "Lebanon's government ordered all schools and universities in Beirut's southern suburb of Hadath to close for the day. Residents were seen fleeing the area in cars and on foot ahead of the strike.",
      "It was the first strike on Beirut since a ceasefire took hold on Nov. 27, 2024, between Israel and Hezbollah, a U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization that has long been powerful political force in Lebanon, although Israel has struck targets in southern Lebanon almost daily since then.",
      "Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after its ally Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack, which ignited the war in Gaza. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis who live in communities near the country's shared border.",
      "Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under the ceasefire deal. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18, but Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon across from communities in northern Israel. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group.",
      "Last week, Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Lebanon killed six people.",
      "The United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said the exchange of fire was deeply concerning. \"This is a critical period for Lebanon and the wider region,\" she said Friday.",
      "The Israeli strikes on Beirut came as Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun made his first visit to Paris as his country's leader. He met Friday with President Emmanuel Macron who, following their meeting, called the Israeli strike \"unacceptable\" and a \"violation of the ceasefire\" that he argued would \"play into the hands of Hezbollah.\"",
      "Aoun called the Friday strike a continuation \"of Israel's violations\" of the November ceasefire agreement, which was sponsored by the U.S. and France.",
      "Israel continues bombing Gaza as humanitarian crisis deepens",
      "The escalation comes 11 days after Israel abruptly ended its separate ceasefire agreement with Hamas in Gaza, by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people in the decimated Palestinian territory.",
      "Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million inhabitants.",
      "Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds in Gaza \u2014 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. Israel is demanding that Hamas give up power, disarm and send its leaders out of Gaza into exile.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire, and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "The war triggered by Hamas' terrorist attack has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Health Ministry. The attack on Israel saw Hamas and its allies kill some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and take 251 others hostage.",
      "Almost 40 more people were killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight, Palestinian media outlets said Friday, including 14 who were reportedly killed in a strike that hit a house in the al-Zaytoun neighborhood in Gaza city. The Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday that 855 people had been killed since the resumption of Israeli attacks on March 18. The Hamas-run ministry's figures do not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties.",
      "The World Central Kitchen charity said in a social media post that one of its volunteers in Gaza was killed in an Israeli airstrike Thursday that hit near one of its kitchens during a meal distribution.",
      "\"Our hearts are heavy today,\" the organization, founded by American-Spanish chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s,\u00a0said in a social media post, adding that six other people were wounded in the same strike. About a year ago, Andr\u00e9s accused Israeli forces of \"targeting us in a deconflicting zone\" in Gaza. The charity acknowledged dismissing some staff in Gaza in December after Israeli authorities provided a list of about 60 WCK volunteers whom it alleged were linked to terrorism.",
      "\"This should not be taken as a conclusion by WCK that the individuals are affiliated with any terror organization,\" the Washington D.C-based charity said at the time. \"Prior to receiving the results of the COGAT [Israeli government] security check, we had no reason for concern regarding any of these individuals and, because Israel does not share intelligence with aid organizations, we do not know the basis for Israel's decision to flag these individuals. However, we felt this step was necessary to protect our team and operations.\"",
      "The United Nations' World Food Program also sounded alarm Friday over the deepening hunger crisis in Gaza more than two weeks after Israel cut off the flow of most humanitarian aid into the territory, with its director in the region telling the Al Jazeera network that more than 90% of the enclave's population lacked food security.",

    "summary": "A new study shows how cuts to foreign aid could lead to millions of HIV/AIDS deaths and soaring rates of infections, undoing decades of progress against the virus.",
    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to global foreign aid, including slashing programs in the United States, could lead to millions of HIV deaths and soaring rates of infections around the world in the coming years, according to a new study.",
      "Published Wednesday in\u00a0The Lancet HIV journal, the modeling study estimates that by 2030, there could be between 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries and 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults. To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026. The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response over the years. According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.\"",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the U.S. contributions play a key role that could not be easily replaced.",
      "\"Many of these countries rely heavily on the United States. Some of them between 50 and 70% of their budgets for HIV diagnosis, treatment and prevention is coming from the United States,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"There's not really any other country that can easily step in. And big picture, this is sort of like telling a surgeon in the middle of surgery to walk away. It's just not that easy to jump in and take over.\"",

      "Buckingham Palace said that after a scheduled cancer treatment on Thursday morning, \"the king experienced temporary side effects that required a short period of observation in hospital.\"",
      "The palace has never said what type of cancer the king has, nor what type of treatment he is receiving.",
      "The king was seen in public in London just a day before his visit on Thursday to a private clinic in central London, seemingly healthy and smiling at a farm exhibition. He reappeared Friday morning, leaving his London residence Clarence House and waving to well-wishers from inside a black Audi.",
      "Tourist Julian Mati told The Associated Press he was relieved to see Charles looking well as he left Clarence House.",
      "\"We were horrified when we heard the news yesterday,\" Mati told the AP. \"We had come down to the palace today to take pictures but we never imagined we would see the king. To see him smiling and waving, it's such a relief.\"",
      "Charles returned to Clarence House on Thursday night, but his events for Friday, which included a trip to Birmingham, about two hours north of London, were all canceled.",
      "The king has maintained a busy schedule of official events in recent weeks, having steadily ramped up his work after returning to public duties in April last year, just several months after beginning his treatment. He made his first foreign trip during the treatment in July 2024, to Australia.",
      "Last week, Charles was in Northern Ireland with Queen Camilla, and he met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this month.",
      "His next scheduled overseas trip, to Italy with the queen next week, was still planned as of Friday.",
      "Cancer has hit several members of the royal family in recent years, with the king's daughter-in-law Catherine, the Princess of Wales, announcing only two months ago that she was in remission after about 10 months of treatment. The princess had\u00a0announced last March\u00a0that cancer was discovered following an\u00a0abdominal surgery\u00a0and she was undergoing preventative chemotherapy.",
      "While the palace has never provided details of her diagnosis, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed in his memoir that\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles' mother, was diagnosed with bone cancer before her death in September 2022 at the age of 96.",

      "Canadian officials are making their voices heard against tariffs through digital billboards in multiple states.",
      "Billboards such as those spotted in the Metro Detroit area this week read, \"Tariffs are a tax on your grocery bill.\"",
      "CBS News Detroit reached out to the Government of Canada, which paid for the ad, on Wednesday. John Babcock, spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, sent a statement Thursday, saying that the billboards were placed in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as Washington, D.C., and surrounding areas.",
      "\"The Government of Canada has launched an educational campaign to inform Americans of the economic impacts of tariffs. The campaign is a strategic investment in Canada's long-term economic interests, and its trade relationship with the United States,\" Babcock said. \"Tariffs are a tax on hard-working Americans in their daily lives. They lead to increased costs on everyday essentials, including fuel and groceries. The purpose is to increase the understanding of the American public and to counter misinformation.\"",
      "President Trump's tariffs were answered by Canada, who then implemented tariffs against the United States. Mr. Trump proposed 25% tariffs on the country and on all steel and aluminum imports. In response, Canada threatened to implement nearly $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump said he would raise the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports to 50%, but retracted that proposal and stayed at the 25% rate.",
      "Earlier this month, Ontario announced it was adding a 25% surcharge on all electricity exports\u00a0sent to the U.S. That surcharge would have affected consumers and businesses in Michigan, Minnesota and New York, but then Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced Canada would suspend that plan and the Trump administration backed off doubling Canadian steel and aluminum tariffs.",
      "In his latest move, Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. on Wednesday. Experts say targeting imported cars could also strain ties with key trading U.S. partners, including Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Europe. Half of the cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany also major suppliers.",
      "Meanwhile, United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain backed Mr. Trump's imposed tariffs on foreign-made cars, applauding the administration for \"stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades.\"",

House Speaker Mike Johnson was aware of some of the conversations about Stefanik that took place Thursday.",
      "Republicans hold just 218 seats in the House, while Democrats hold 213 seats. There are currently four vacant seats. After the president's announcement, Johnson acknowledged the Republicans' slim majority on social media as he hailed Stefanik's \"selfless decision.\"",
      "\"It is well known Republicans have a razor-thin House majority, and Elise's agreement to withdraw her nomination will allow us to keep one of the toughest, most resolute members of our Conference in place to help drive forward President Trump's America First policies,\" Johnson said on social platform X, calling Stefanik \"a great leader and a devoted patriot.\"",

Hodak, 23, was a member of the 93rd Bombardment Squadron in the 19th Bombardment group in March 1945, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. Hodak, of Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, was a gunner aboard a B-29 \"Superfortress\" aircraft. These planes had multiple machine guns, held over 20,000 pounds of bombs and were especially suited to fly to Japan from bases in China during World War II, according to the National Museum of the United States Air Force.",
      "Hodak's plane was shot down while on a mission to Tokyo. He was initially reported as missing in action, the DPAA said, but investigators learned he had been captured after the plane was taken down. He was taken to the Tokyo Military Prison.",
      "In late May 1945, U.S. aircraft heavily bombed Tokyo, causing huge fires and burning hundreds of structures, according to Military.com. One of the destroyed buildings was the Tokyo Military Prison. Hodak was among the service members being held there at the time. None of the people imprisoned at the facility survived the blaze, Military.com reported. They were buried in a mass grave.",
      "The American Graves Registration Service disinterred 65 sets of remains from the prison in early 1946, after World War II ended. The service was able to identify 25 sets of remains. One was a Japanese person, the DPAA said. The 39 unidentified sets of remains were interred as Unknowns at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines.",
      "In 2022, the sets of remains were disinterred again and sent to the DPAA laboratory for analysis. In 2024, the DPAA launched the Tokyo Prison Fire Project. In a social media post, the agency said the project \"faces considerable forensic challenges due to the burned and fragmentary condition of the remains and extreme commingling.\"",
      "To identify Hodak's remains, DPAA scientists used dental and anthropological analysis, as well as circumstantial evidence, the agency said. DNA sequencing has also been used to identify service members who died at the prison, the DPAA said on social media.",

Officials in Japan have heard these comments from Mr. Trump before, and so far, they've continued shaping the country's national security plans based on the assurance of backing from the United States.",
      "Government officials admit they really have no other choice.",
      "\"There is no Plan B for Japan other than the U.S.,\" Takuya Akiyama, Principal Deputy Director of the North American Affairs Bureau at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CBS News. \"Treaty wise and also as a physical presence, no other country can substitute the U.S. It is unthinkable.\"",
      "The U.S. may be pulling back from Europe under President Trump, but despite his remarks about Japan, U.S. military cooperation with Tokyo has appeared stable, and may even expand as the White House ramps up its standoff with Asia's increasingly assertive superpower, China.",
      "China's threat to its neighbors",
      "Japanese officials may have breathed a sigh of relief after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's visit to the White House in February. The Trump administration reaffirmed its commitment to Japan's defense, including amid Tokyo's dispute with Beijing over ownership of the Senkaku islands.",
      "It is one of many land ownership disputes between China and its neighbors over islands in the South China Sea \u2014 virtually all of which Beijing claims as its territory. The White House has repeatedly condemned Chinese aggression and militarization in the South China Sea, and U.S. warships and aircraft routinely carry out \"freedom of navigation\" exercises in the area \u2014 often drawing sharp rebukes from Beijing.",
      "Advisers to the Japanese prime minister spent the months after the U.S. election preparing him for the meeting with Mr. Trump. They focused on using clear and concise language to convey the benefits of the security alliance to the U.S., and the increase Japan has made in its own defense spending and military procurement from America, according to officials at the Japanese foreign ministry.",
      "China has been rapidly bolstering its military capabilities, including its nuclear program, in recent years, according to U.S. officials. Last year, China announced a 7.2% increase in its defense budget, which was already the world's second-highest, behind only the United States.",
      "In February, Taiwan condemned China and deployed its own forces in response as the Chinese military held \"shooting training\" drills in the Taiwan Strait.",
      "\"From an American perspective, it's clear that if Taiwan falls, and if Japan falls, that our alliances in the Indo-Pacific are over,\" Kenneth Weinstein, Japan Chair at the Hudson Institute think tank, told CBS News. \"China will exercise extraordinary military sway \u2014 will be able to close down global shipping such as they see it, will be able to throttle access to the South China Sea and elsewhere.\"",
      "There have already been tense encounters between Japanese and Chinese naval vessels around the Senkaku islands, a group of uninhabited islands claimed by both Beijing and Tokyo. According to data from Japan's coast guard, Chinese government vessels entered the maritime zone around the islands, which China calls the Diaoyus, on 355 of the 366 days of 2024 \u2014 the highest number of intrusions reported by Japan since China started operating around the islands in 2008.",
      "The Chinese vessels operating around the islands have increased not only in number, but in armament, carrying more and larger weapons as they circle the disputed territories, according to officials at the foreign and defense ministries.",
      "While Japanese analysts don't believe a Chinese military invasion of the Senkaku islands is imminent, they say there's a risk that an accident or incident involving fishing or other non-military vessels in the area could lead to a rapid military escalation.",
      "\"The Chinese Communist Party believes in power. They have started to act because they believe they now have the power to do so,\" China expert Akio Takahara, a professor at the Tokyo Woman's Christian University, told CBS News. \"We want the U.S. to increase their presence in this region, because the Chinese are certainly going to enhance their presence in the region.\"",
      "Major boost to U.S.-Japan defense cooperation coming?",
      "Japan has revamped its approach to defense in recent years, including by committing to spend 2% of its GDP on defense by 2027. Japan announced a major policy shift in 2022, abandoning the country's post-World War II, exclusively defense posture with a decision to acquire counterstrike capabilities.",
      "The Trump administration has seemingly approved of the changes, and it has not asked Japan for even greater increases in defense spending as some Japanese officials feared it might.",
      "While Mr. Trump complained specifically this month about Japan's hypothetical preparedness to meet its mutual defense obligation to the U.S. under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Japanese officials have tried to focus more on Article 6, under which Japan provides bases and facilities for U.S. forces. And that aspect of the relationship could be set to expand.",
      "The U.S. and Japan have been in discussions since before Mr. Trump came back to the White House about the possible establishment of a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan. If it happens, it would upgrade the role of the U.S. forces in Japan to a command headquarters with operational authority. The dialogue over the upgrade was announced under the Biden administration, after being requested by the Japanese.",
      "In the event of a regional security crisis \u2014 such as a Chinese attack on Taiwan or a disputed South China Sea island \u2014 having a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan would give the U.S. military the capacity to respond with commands from the region, rather than waiting for orders to come from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to meet with his Japanese counterpart in late March to discuss efforts to bolster U.S. forces in the Pacific region.",
      "Concern over Ukraine",
      "The dramatic vacillations by the Trump administration in its stance on Ukraine have also raised concern in Japan. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Japan has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. Japanese officials worry about the precedent that would be set if the U.S. is seen to abandon a partner nation in the face of an invasion by a more powerful neighbor.",
      "\"In light of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, countries' perceptions on security have drastically changed around the world,\" then-Japanese Prime minister Fumio Kishida said at a regional security summit In June 2022, several months into Russia's invasion. \"I myself have a strong sense of urgency that Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow.\"",
      "The Japanese fear that if the U.S. and the world at large are prepared to accept a change in Europe's borders forced by Russian aggression, they could also decline to intervene in the case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.",
      "\"The Chinese will be encouraged that, perhaps if Xi Jinping did something similar, Trump will be as kind to Xi Jinping as he's been to Putin,\" professor Takahara told CBS News. \"That kind of message will be received in Beijing.\"",
      "Officials in Tokyo are trying to remain focused on the long-term bilateral relationship with Washington, looking beyond the Trump administration, but they know China is watching closely as the relationship develops, especially given the volatile nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy.",
      "\"We don't know what Mr. Trump will be saying tomorrow and doing the day after. So, at least the Ishiba visit, the first round, went okay. We were happy about that,\" Takahara said. \"But what about the next round? When is it coming? No one knows.\"",

      "The three women from Revere, Massachusetts, 23-year-old Kaoutar Naqqad, 24-year-old Imane Mallah and 26-year-old Wafae El-Arar, were found unconscious in their hotel room at the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in February. Investigators in Belize said last month that the women had a build-up of fluids in their lungs but were still awaiting final test results for the cause of death.",
      "Gian Cho, executive director of the National Forensics Science Service, said Wednesday that all three women had carboxyhemoglobin levels higher than 60%. Carboxyhemoglobin levels are typically lower than 2% in nonsmokers and lower than 5% in smokers.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas and is produced any time a fossil fuel is burned.\u00a0 Accidental poisoning can occur when home appliances like furnaces, kerosene heaters, stoves, lanterns and generators produce fumes that people breathe in.",
      "Belize Police Commissioner Chester Williams said that as a result of the findings, authorities have conducted a second test of the hotel room for carbon monoxide poisoning after initial testing showed no signs. Williams said they are still awaiting the final test results.",

      "\"We have said since the beginning of this investigation that their deaths were suspicious and raised concerns about initial reports in the news media. While today's official finding puts to rest those initial reports, we hope this will give authorities in law enforcement pause before they make similar suggestions during future investigations,\" the families said, noting they were still awaiting results of an independent review being conducted by Massachusettes authorities. \"Survivors such as our families deserve their best, honest work.

      "The editor of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, has nothing to say about his relationship with national security adviser Mike Waltz, who inadvertently added him to a group chat about the United States' highly sensitive plans to bomb Yemen days ago.",
      "\"I'm just not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz,\" Goldberg told CBS News in an interview Wednesday.",
      "Waltz claimed he has \"never met\" with Goldberg, wouldn't be able to pick him out of a police lineup and trashed his reputation, calling him \"the bottom scum of journalists.\" But photos surfaced online earlier Wednesday of the two together at an event at the French Embassy in 2021.",
      "\"If your eyeballs see us together, then I guess your eyeballs are seeing us together,\" Goldberg said of the photos.",
      "Waltz has also suggested that Goldberg somehow added himself to the Signal chat that also included Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 or that some other technical mishap that led to the breach. Goldberg called the claims \"crazy.\"",
      "\"This is what happened on March 11,\" Goldberg continued. \"I got a message request from Michael Waltz. I accepted the message request. That's what happened.\" Signal only allows users to add people to chat groups by phone number, QR code or username of the person they wish to add. The Atlantic story published Wednesday included a screenshot that showed Waltz as administrator and \"JG\" as a member of the group chat, named the \"Houthi PC small group.\"",
      "\"If I'm such a nefarious character,\" Goldberg said, \"why am I in Mike Waltz's phone? Why does he have my phone number? Why is he including me in this chat? And what do you expect a reporter to do when you learn interesting information about the way an administration is contemplating military action? What do they really think is going to happen?\"",
      "Goldberg did not publish the contents of the message thread until more than a week after the Yemen strikes. On Monday, he posted a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat and characterized parts of the conversation about plans to bomb Houthi targets, rather than quoting them directly, citing his concerns that the details were too sensitive to publish. But after the group chat members and President Trump repeatedly denied that the information was classified, Goldberg, after checking with the administration to see if officials wanted anything redacted, published the text messages about the strikes on Wednesday.",
      "The additional messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Goldberg said it's in the public's interest to have the information and be able to judge the incident for themselves.",
      "\"The public has a right to know if there's a massive security breach in the national security apparatus of the United States. There's obvious proof here that national security officials we're talking about real-time intelligence and military information on an open source messaging app that they're not supposed to use for that sort of thing,\" Goldberg said. \"When reporters discover a massive national security breach, it's our duty to tell the public.\"",

    "summary": "As Trump Cabinet members sent texts on Signal, one of them, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia, but the White House says he didn't have his phone.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it.",
      "Speaking Wednesday during a briefing at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff did not have his personal device or his government-issued phone with him in Moscow. She said he was given access to a \"classified protected server by the United States government, and he was very careful about his communications when he was in Russia.\"",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "Witkoff, in his own social media post Wednesday, said he \"had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "\"I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government for special circumstances when you travel to regions where you do not want your devices compromised,\" Witkoff said.",
      "The White House has not answered CBS News' question about whether Witkoff's government-issued phone had on it the Signal account in question. During a congressional hearing\u00a0Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said \"the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying\u00a0no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for the pre-planned hearing\u00a0on worldwide security threats  that continued on Wednesday. Ratcliffe acknowledged Tuesday during the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own\u00a0report\u00a0for The Atlantic.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however.",
      "The Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal that included sensitive details about military strikes in Yemen after\u00a0more text messages came to light\u00a0and revealed new details about what was shared.",
      "The spy chiefs were on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify before the House Intelligence Committee alongside FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse at a hearing ostensibly focused on the global security threats facing the U.S. But the Signal leak and its fallout dominated much of the questioning, especially from Democrats.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe continued to insist that no classified information was sent in the group chat, baffling Democrats who cited executive orders and internal government guidance to argue that the operational details should have been considered highly classified.",
      "Shortly before the hearing began, The Atlantic\u00a0published\u00a0additional messages showing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the chat, and Goldberg revealed the first batch of texts earlier this week. He initially declined to publish the most sensitive texts because, he wrote, the information \"could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel.\" The magazine decided to unveil the withheld messages after Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other officials publicly asserted that the information wasn't classified.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee, chastised the intelligence leaders at the start of the hearing, saying they put the lives of troops at risk.",
      "\"Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships,\" Himes said.",
      "Gabbard acknowledged that the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat.",
      "\"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers, echoing the defense from the White House that \"war plans\" were not discussed, despite the detailed guidance for an impending attack. Hegseth and other administration officials attacked The Atlantic and Goldberg in the wake of the latest texts' release, accusing them and the media at large of blowing the situation out of proportion.",
      "Himes told Gabbard that, under the ODNI's own guidance, \"information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack\" should be classified as top secret. Gabbard said the information Hegseth disclosed in the chat would fall under the Defense Department's classification guidance and she was unfamiliar with the department's specific guidance for classification.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, pointed out that the Defense Department's manual on classification says that \"information shall be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause describable damage to national security.\" Krishnamoorthi also cited an executive order issued by President Barack Obama and retained by President Trump that says information should be classified if \"its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations.\"",
      "\"Applying the executive order as well as the DOD manual to this fact pattern, we clearly have weapon systems that have been identified. That is classified information,\" Krishnamoorthi said after reading Hegseth's texts.",
      "Ratcliffe defended his participation in the chat, saying that a CIA official whose name he sent to the group was his chief of staff and is not undercover. He accused Goldberg of insinuating that Ratcliffe improperly disclosed the name to the group and said Signal is an acceptable means of communication for the CIA.",
      "\"My answers haven't changed. I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information, and at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, accused the officials of misleading the public about the information's classification, arguing there has been \"much less sensitive\" information presented to lawmakers that has \"high classification.\"",
      "\"The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee would not be classified, y'all know, is a lie. That's ridiculous,\" he said.",
      "Castro asked Haugh, the NSA director, whether such details would be classified if intercepted by his agency. Haugh said it would be classified to protect sources and methods, \"not necessarily based off the content.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee had a muted response to the scandal during the hearing, with most focusing their questions on other areas of national security. Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said at the top of the hearing that he wanted members to discuss \"the real and existential threats that face our nation\" after the Senate Intelligence Committee was consumed with questions about the group chat.",
      "One of the feistiest moments during the hearing came when Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked about Hegseth's drinking habits and if the intelligence officials had any knowledge of the defense secretary being under the influence before the sending of texts about the strikes. Gabbard said she did not have any knowledge of Hegseth's personal activities. Ratcliffe shot back, \"I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no!\"",
      "\"Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised!\" Gomez said during the heated back and forth.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe were both grilled by Democrats on the Senate panel on Tuesday about the security breach. Both acknowledged that they were part of the chat, but denied that classified information was shared.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, pressed both of them about whether targets, weapons systems or timing were discussed in the chat during Tuesday's hearing. They claimed they did not recall those details being discussed.",
      "\"In the Signal chain that we have been talking about, was there any mention of a target in Yemen?\" Kelly said.",
      "\"I don't remember mention of specific targets,\" Gabbard responded. Ratcliffe said that answer was \"consistent with my recollection.\"",
      "Gabbard also said she didn't recall \"specific names of systems or weapons being used or named,\" which Ratcliffe echoed. They also said they did not remember mentions of timing or military assets that were used.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would \"look into\" whether administration officials should continue using the encrypted messaging app to communicate, but largely dismissed the severity of the leak.",
      "Annual threat assessment",
      "This week's House and Senate hearings coincided with the release of the intelligence community's annual threat assessment. This year's 31-page report details threats posed by foreign illicit drug actors, such as drug cartels in Mexico, Islamic extremists, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "\"Cooperation among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea has been growing more rapidly in recent years, reinforcing threats from each of them individually while also posing new challenges to U.S. strength and power globally,\" the assessment says.",
      "According to the report, Russia's war in Ukraine has accelerated cooperation between the four nations and Russia has become increasingly reliant on the other countries to carry out its military objectives and mitigate economic consequences imposed by its adversaries.",
      "Despite the heavy costs associated with the Ukraine invasion, \"Russia has proven adaptable and resilient\" and its air forces are \"more modern and capable than at the start of the invasion,\" the assessment says.",
      "\"The war in Ukraine has afforded Moscow a wealth of lessons regarding combat against Western weapons and intelligence in a large-scale war,\" the report says. \"This experience probably will challenge future U.S. defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned.\"",
      "It added that the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin loses his grip on power \"probably is less likely now than at any point in his quarter-century rule.\"",
      "China is viewed as \"most capable\" of threatening U.S. interests abroad. The country poses \"the most comprehensive and robust\" military threat to U.S. national security and the \"most active and persistent\" cyber threat to government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S., according to the report. But intelligence agencies assess China as being \"more cautious than Russia, Iran, and North Korea about risking its economic and diplomatic image in the world by being too aggressive and disruptive.\"",
      "The intelligence community expects Beijing to dial up pressure on Taiwan in 2025 as it seeks reunification with the self-ruled island.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran will continue to target former and current U.S. officials over the killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the report said. Mr. Trump, however, has revoked the security details for several former officials despite the ongoing threat posed by Iran.",
      "The report also says that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not reauthorized the program, \"though pressure has probably built on him to do so.\"",

      "The government attempts to thread the needle regarding Boasberg's directive, arguing that it didn't \"remove\" any of the migrants after he entered his order and that it \"complied with the Court's injunction with respect to the two flights at issue\" because it didn't formally remove anyone after 7:25 p.m. Saturday, though acknowledging it \"did not order any removal flights to return to the United States.\"",
      "Boasberg asked Drew Ensign, the attorney for the Justice Department, if he understood the verbal orders to turn the plane around and if Ensign understood if the order was immediate. Ensign said he did. But in its appellate court filing, the DOJ continued to argue that Boasberg's order was unclear and insufficient to be binding, asserting it \"failed to satisfy the requirements for issuing a binding injunction\" because Boasberg and the court didn't state \"the reasons why it issued\" the injunction.",
      "\"It is well-settled (in law) that an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction,\" the filing alleges.",
      "The DOJ later in the filing argues that once the flights were out of U.S. airspace, they were \"military matters\" and President Trump has the power to order military flights wherever he wants.",
      "\"DOJ cites state secrets privilege\"",
      "On Monday, the administration invoked a state secrets privilege\u00a0and refused to give Boasberg any additional information about the deportations.",
      "Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has\u00a0asked for details\u00a0about when the planes landed and who was on board, information the administration asserts would harm \"diplomatic and national security concerns.\"",
      "Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift\u00a0Boasberg's order\u00a0and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the three-judge panel.",
      "Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said, \"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" referring to the way Nazis detained in the U.S.\u00a0during World World II were processed compared to the Venezuelan immigrants deported\u00a0to El Salvador this month under the same statute.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" government attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Millett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged\u00a0Tren de Aragua\u00a0gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison didn't have the chance to appear in court.",
      "Millett is one of the three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn't rule from the bench Monday.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, who also sits on the appeals court, appeared open to the administration's argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation's capital. The third judge on the panel didn't ask any questions.",
      "The administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II. The law has only been invoked three times throughout American history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "Also on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Mr. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.",
      "Ensign argued that Boasberg's ruling was an \"unprecedented and enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws like anyone else,\" said Millett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, whom Mr. Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's assertions that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.",
      "\"You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,\" Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.",
      "\"We have no idea if everyone is in Texas,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Walker also pressed the plaintiffs' lawyer to cite any prior case in which a judicial order blocking \"a national security operation with foreign implications\" survived appellate review.",
      "Gelernt accused the administration of trying to use the law to \"short circuit\" immigration proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorneys had no way to individually challenge all the deportations before planeloads of Venezuelans took off on March 15, he added.",
      "\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She's the one who didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.",
      "Boasberg, also an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. He said there is \"a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.\"",
      "\"The public also has a significant stake in the Government's compliance with the law,\"\u00a0the judge wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg.",
      "In a rare statement, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"",
      "Just after midnight Monday, Mr. Trump posted a social media message questioning Boasberg's impartiality and calling for him to be disbarred.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats grilled the leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies Tuesday over a security breach in which top Trump officials inadvertently included a journalist in a group chat about the United States' highly sensitive plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify about global threats facing the U.S. However the annual hearing, which typically focuses on threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, largely concentrated on the lapse.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse also appeared, but received few questions.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, addressed the controversy at the top of the hearing, calling it \"mind-boggling\" that none of the intelligence officials in the chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal thought to check who else was included.",
      "\"Are these government devices? Were they personal devices? Have the devices been collected to make sure there's no malware?\" Warner said in his opening remarks. \"There's plenty of declassified information that shows that our adversaries, China and Russia, are trying to break into encryption systems like Signal.\"",
      "Warner's declaration that the use of the group chat was part of a \"pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information is reckless, sloppy and stunning\" set the tone for Democrats in the hearing.",
      "Group chat controversy",
      "On Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal about the war plans, although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later denied any war plans were discussed. Accounts appearing to be Gabbard and Ratcliffe both participated in the message thread, according to Goldberg.",
      "In the group chat, which was started by President Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, Ratcliffe allegedly shared information \"that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The National Security Council said Monday in a statement to CBS News that the message thread \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "\"If it's not classified, share the texts now\": Democrats grill on group chat",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe both denied that classified information was shared in the group chat in a feisty exchange with Warner. Confronted by Warner, Gabbard initially declined to say whether she was part of the chat.",
      "\"Because it's all classified?\" Warner said.",
      "\"Because this is currently under review,\" Gabbard responded.",
      "\"If it's not classified, share the texts now,\" Warner said.",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed to Warner that he was a participant in the message thread, but pushed back on whether the decision to use Signal to communicate was a security lapse. Ratcliffe said Signal was on his CIA computer when he was confirmed as director earlier this year.",
      "\"As it is for most CIA officers,\" he said, adding that the agency considers the commercial app \"permissible\" for work use.",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed to Warner that he was a participant in the message thread, but pushed back on whether the decision to use Signal to communicate was a security lapse. Ratcliffe said Signal was on his CIA computer when he was confirmed as director earlier this year. \"As it is for most CIA officers,\" he said, adding that the agency considers the commercial app \"permissible\" for work use.",
      "\"It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes, provided, senator, that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels,\" Ratcliffe said. \"My communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"",
      "Ratcliffe later told Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency recommended that \"high-level officials who would be targeted by foreign adversaries\" use \"end-to-end encrypted apps whenever possible.\"",
      "The spy chiefs also denied that the conversation included information on weapons packages, targets or timing of the strikes, as Goldberg reported.",
      "\"Not that I'm aware of,\" Ratcliffe said, with Gabbard adding \"same answer.\"",
      "But Gabbard later told Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, that \"there was discussion around targets in general,\" which Ratcliffe said was consistent with his recollection. When asked whether there was any mention of a weapon or weapons system, Gabbard said she did not recall \"specific weapons systems being named.\" Ratcliffe also said, \"I don't recall.\" Both gave similar responses when asked about timing or any mention of military units.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia noted that, according to the messages shared by Goldberg, the timing of the strikes were debated by Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth.",
      "\"They were discussing the timing of sending U.S. air crews into enemy airspace, where they faced an air defense threat, correct?\" Ossoff asked, repeating the question when Ratcliffe didn't directly answer. \"They're talking about the timing of U.S. airstrikes, correct?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "\"And therefore the timing of U.S. air crews into hostile airspace, correct?\" Ossoff said.",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "During questioning from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, both Ratcliffe and Gabbard also denied participating in any Signal group chats in which classified information was shared.",
      "Gabbard told Wyden she had \"no objection\" to cooperating with an audit to confirm such, while Ratcliffe said he would comply with any follow up that the National Security Council deemed appropriate.",
      "Another heated moment came during the back and forth between Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, and Ratcliffe. Bennet asked whether the CIA director knew that Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow when the group chat, which Witkoff was part of, according to Goldberg, was ongoing. Ratcliffe said he was unaware that Witkoff was in Russia. Flight data show that\u00a0Witkoff was in Russia\u00a0during part of the conversation, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "\"It's an embarrassment,\" Bennet said. \"You need to do better.\"",
      "Gabbard acknowledged to Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, that she was overseas during at least part of the group chat discussions, though she declined to say if she was using a work or personal phone for the discussions, citing a review by the National Security Council.",

      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance is joining his wife, second lady Usha Vance, on her visit to Greenland this week, he announced, a trip that will now focus on a U.S. Space Force base there.",
      "The White House\u00a0previously said\u00a0the second lady would arrive in Greenland Thursday and return on Saturday, and that she would\u00a0 visit \"historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.\"",
      "But the vice president's office now says the Vances will travel Friday to the Pituffik Space Base   in Greenland to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members, and the base visit will take place in lieu of the second lady's attendance at the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.",
      "The vice president's decision comes after Greenland's prime minister said planned trips there by top Trump officials are \"highly aggressive,\" and as President Trump isn't backing down on his hopes to acquire the semiautonomous territory of Denmark. National security adviser Mike Waltz has also been expected to visit Greenland soon.",
      "\"Hey guys, It's JD Vance, the vice president,\" Vance said in a video\u00a0posted to social media. \"And you know, there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her.\"",
      "\"I'm going to visit some of our guardians in the Space Force on the northwest coast of Greenland, and also just check out what's going on with the security there of Greenland,\" Vance continued. \"As you know, it's really important. A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there.\"",
      "Vance didn't explicitly mention Mr. Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland, but said they want to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland, because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of acquiring Greenland, despite being rebuffed by local officials.",
      "Heather Conley, an expert on Arctic geopolitics and former deputy assistant secretary of state, told CBS Mornings the Trump administration is \"absolutely right\" that Greenland is strategic for the U.S. in protecting against Russian missiles and protecting U.S. airspace and maritime space, \"but if we're not careful, we're going to, unfortunately, have our allies fear us and resist increasing our security and prosperity right now.\"",
      "Conley said multiple U.S. administrations have contemplated purchasing Greenland, so Mr. Trump isn't the first. But NATO and a bilateral defense agreement with Denmark rendered that less necessary. And she's concerned the Trump administration's rhetoric will backfire.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, and this is what is really backfiring, this type of rhetoric,\" she said. \"Again, we have a phenomenal ally in the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlandic officials, that we have this rich history of defense cooperation. They are ready to increase defense spending. The Danish government has increased defense spending. They're going to probably do it again. Very focused on \u2014 on the Arctic, Arctic security. They're open for business for the United States. So that door is open. But when we sort of drop in private visits, we use this aggressive language now, officials are saying, you're provoking us. You are threatening our territorial integrity, our national security. What is going on here?\"",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was his country's understanding that the Black Sea agreement was in effect immediately, and Russia's government also released a statement confirming that it had agreed to the terms.",
      "Zelenskyy noted that the White House statement did not specify any actions to be taken if Russia violates the terms of the agreement, and he said Ukraine would appeal directly to the Trump administration for more weapons and more sanctions against Russia in such a case.",
      "\"In accordance with the agreement between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States, the Russian and American sides agreed to ensure the implementation of the 'Black Sea Initiative,' which includes ensuring the safety of navigation in the Black Sea, the non-use of force and the prevention of the use of commercial vessels for military purposes while organizing appropriate control measures through the inspection of such vessels,\" the Kremlin said in a statement published by the Russian state-run news agency TASS.",
      "It said that in return for the Black Sea deal, the U.S. would \"help restore access for Russian agricultural and fertilizer exports to the world market, reduce the cost of shipping insurance, and expand access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.\"",
      "The terms of the deal, as described by the Kremlin, appeared to be based largely on the previous Black Sea Grain Initiative, a limited ceasefire brokered by the United Nations and Turkey that Russia walked away from in 2023. Moscow claimed the U.S. and other Ukrainian partners weren't keeping up their end of the agreement in 2023, by blocking the export of some Russian agricultural products.",

    "summary": "After spending 40 years in Utah, the Sundance Film Festival will be relocating to Boulder, Colorado; organizers said the festival had outgrown Park City.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "After a yearlong search, the Sundance Film Festival announced Thursday that its new home will be Boulder, Colorado, keeping Sundance in the mountains but moving it out of Park City, the Utah ski town that had for decades provided the premier independent film gathering its picturesque snowy backdrop.",
      "Organizers said that after 40 years in the mountains, the festival had outgrown Park City, and lacked the necessary theaters or affordable housing to continue hosting what has become one of North America\u2019s most sprawling movie events. Sundance had narrowed down the options to Salt Lake City (with a smaller presence in Park City), Cincinnati and Boulder.",
      "'IMPORTANT LESSON': CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST REVEALS 'FASCINATING' EXPERIENCE AT LIBERAL SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL",
      "Boulder emerged as their choice due to its close proximity to nature, its small-town charm and an engaged community that, organizer said, provides Sundance the ideal setting for its future.",
      "\"Boulder is a tech town, it\u2019s a college town, it\u2019s an arts town, and it\u2019s a mountain town,\" Amanda Kelso, acting chief executive of the Sundance Institute, said in an interview Thursday from Boulder. \"At 100,000 people, a larger town than Park City, it gives us the space to expand.\"",
      "Kelso, Sundance Institute board chair Ebs Burnough and Eugene Hernandez, director of the festival and head of programming, spoke shortly before announcing the festival\u2019s move in Boulder. Local officials, who helped lure Sundance with $34 million in tax credits over 10 years, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator and important contributor to our thriving culture,\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (Dem.) said in a statement.",
      "Reacting to the decision, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (Rep.) said Thursday that Sundance will come to regret leaving Utah.",
      "\"As I\u2019ve said from the beginning, we wanted Sundance to stay,\" Cox said in a statement. \"We made that clear to their leadership and put together a highly competitive package. Ultimately, this decision is theirs to make, but I believe it\u2019s a mistake and that, one day, they\u2019ll realize they left behind not just a place, but their heritage.\"",
      "The marquee of the Egyptian Theatre appears during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah on Jan. 28, 2020.\u00a0 (Arthur Mola/Invision/AP)",
      "A changed endorsed by Sundance founder Robert Redford",
      "A shift from Park City to Boulder means Sundance stays at altitude but gives up being located in an expensive ski town. The mile-high Colorado city set in the foothills of the Rockies also maintains a sense of surrounding nature \u2014 something organizers stressed as a factor in their decision. Boulder\u2019s four-block pedestrian mall on Pearl Street, with nearby theaters, could also provide a similar sense of central hub like Park City\u2019s Main Street. The Macky Auditorium, on the University of Colorado campus, is expected to be a central stage for Sundance.",
      "The Sundance Institute was founded in 1981 by Robert Redford, who sought a location far from Hollywood to foster independent voices in film. In 1984, the institute took over the Sundance Film Festival, but the nonprofit\u2019s mission of helping young filmmakers grow through labs and workshops \u2014 Redford\u2019s real passion \u2014 continued year-round away from the festival.",
      "The 88-year-old Redford, who attended the University of Colorado in Boulder in his youth, gave the move his blessing.",
      "\"Words cannot express the sincere gratitude I have for Park City, the state of Utah, and all those in the Utah community that have helped to build the organization,\" Redford said in a statement. \"What we\u2019ve created is remarkably special and defining. As change is inevitable, we must always evolve and grow, which has been at the core of our survival.\"",
      "How Sundance chose its new home",
      "The festival made \"ethos and equity values\" one of its criteria, prompting many to wonder how much local politics would influence the choice by Sundance, which emphasizes inclusivity. Gov. Cox is currently weighing a bill that would ban the flying of certain flags at schools and government buildings, including the LGBTQ pride flag.",
      "Organizers said Boulder\u2019s \"welcoming environment aligns with the ethos the Sundance Film Festival developed in Park City.\"",
      "\"This process started 18 months ago and we\u2019ve been in Utah for 40 years. So politics really didn\u2019t guide the process,\" Burnough said Thursday. \"It was really and truly about evolution. That\u2019s where it landed. We didn\u2019t constantly spend time examining what bill was going forward or may or may not be signed.\"",
      "With its current contract expiration date looming, the hunt for a new host city began in earnest in April 2024. The initial group of six contenders also included Atlanta, Louisville, Kentucky and Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "What Sundance has meant for Park City, and the film world",
      "Before packing up, Sundance will have one last edition in Park City in January 2026.",
      "\"The Sundance Film Festival will be the Sundance Film Festival wherever we go. What\u2019s consistent is our mission,\" said Hernandez. \"This is a festival of global discovery. What\u2019s exciting about Boulder is this is a place we can build.\"",
      "Over the years, Sundance in Park City swelled into a premier marketplace for American film, drawing studio executives and parka-wearing celebrities into the Wasatch mountains every January. It helped launch countless filmmakers over the years, from Steven Soderbergh (\"Sex, Lies and Videotape\") to Ryan Coogler (\"Fruitvale Station\"). Sundance scored its first best picture winner with \"CODA\" in 2022.",
      "Sundance meant big business for Utah and Park City. In 2024, the festival had some 72,840 in-person attendees, 24,200 of whom were coming from out of state. According to the festival\u2019s economic impact report, out-of-state visitors spent an estimated $106.4 million in Utah during the festival. Its total economic impact was estimated to be $132 million, with 1,730 jobs for Utah residents and $69.7 million in Utah wages.",
      "But the festival had also sparred with local ski resorts \u2014 Park City\u2019s other major money maker \u2014 as festivalgoers filled the hotels and left the slopes virtually empty for two weeks during peak ski season. The festival was a boon to some local businesses, but a hindrance to others. For visitors flying into the 10-day festival, ballooning rental costs increasingly factored into attending.",

      "All three top contenders budgeted millions to lure the lucrative festival to their city. Cincinnati set aside $2.5 million for Sundance and another $2.5 million to come if it was chosen. Salt Lake City offered Sundance $3.5 million to stay in Utah.",
      "Sundance's relocation puts two of the top U.S. film festivals in Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival, held further west in the state, runs in late August."

      "CURE FOR MEN'S HAIR LOSS COULD BE FOUND IN SUGAR STORED IN THE BODY, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "In a 2023 clinical trial, researchers found that applying PP405 as a topical medicine to the scalp at bedtime showed \"statistically significant\" results.",
      "They believe this treatment will produce \"full \u2018terminal\u2019 hair rather than the peach fuzz variety.\"",
      "PP405 is now in Phase 2 clinical trials for men and women with androgenetic alopecia, according to a researcher.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "William Lowry, Ph.D., a co-researcher at UCLA Broad Stem Cell Research Center, told Fox News Digital that although this research is promising, \"cure is a strong word.\"",

      "\"At HUD, we only serve one out of four Americans that we should be serving, and that has to come to an end,\" Turner continued. \"And so we're not only making it a priority, but we are making that our only priority, that American citizens will benefit from hard-working American taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "The HUD secretary has been on an immigration blitz, including joining forces with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to form a new interagency initiative aimed at ensuring that federal housing funds do not go to illegal immigrants. The pair of Trump officials signed a Memorandum of Understanding Monday that solidified the partnership in its effort to end \"wasteful misappropriation\" of taxpayer-funded public housing resources that previously benefited illegal immigrants who flooded the nation under the Biden administration.",

      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "ClickFix is a reminder that malware doesn\u2019t always rely on complex exploits. It often just needs you to follow the wrong instructions. Attackers are refining their methods, making scams like fake CAPTCHAs, phishing emails and deceptive pop-ups more convincing than ever. The best way to stay ahead is to question anything that seems even slightly off. If a website asks you to run commands or paste something into PowerShell, it\u2019s a red flag. If an email pressures you into clicking a link, verify it first.",

      "Hackers worldwide are exploiting any type of free document converter or downloader tool to carry out this scheme. The scam may involve websites that promise to convert files, such as turning a .doc into a .pdf, or tools that claim to merge multiple images into a single document.

      "3. Avoid downloading executable files:\u00a0If an online document converter provides an .exe, .bat or .scr file instead of a standard document format, do not download or run it. Legitimate converters should only generate files like .pdf, .docx or .png, not executables that could contain malware.",
      "4. Scan files after conversion: Even if you use a trusted converter, always scan the converted file with up-to-date\u00a0strong antivirus software before opening it.",
      "5. Check file permissions: After conversion, verify that the new file doesn't have unexpected permissions or properties that could indicate malware.",
      "6. Create backups and enable ransomware protection:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0back up important documents on an external drive or a secure cloud service. Some security suites, like Microsoft Defender, offer ransomware protection features that prevent unauthorized changes to your files.",
      "7. Be cautious of browser extensions: Avoid installing browser extensions for file conversion, as these can often be browser hijackers or adware.",
      "8. Consider paid services: If you frequently need to convert files, invest in a reputable paid service that offers better security and privacy protection.",
      "9. Use cloud-based solutions: Consider using cloud-based productivity suites that offer built-in conversion tools, reducing the need for third-party converters.",

      "The real issue is not just malware-laced converters but the habit of trading security for convenience without a second thought. The internet is filled with services that appear free but come at the hidden cost of stolen data, financial fraud or compromised devices. Instead of trusting every tool that offers an easy solution, it is important to think critically about what we are giving away whenever we upload a file or click a download button.",

      "4) Download and secure your data: Before considering account deletion, download your genetic record and store it securely on an encrypted device or cloud service.",
      "5) Request data deletion: If you no longer wish for your data to be stored by 23andMe, request its deletion through your account settings. Ensure you also ask for the destruction of any physical samples.",
      "6) Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication:\u00a0Creating unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts and devices is essential. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts; this kind of password reuse was a factor in the recent\u00a023andMe data breach. Enable two-factor authentication wherever it\u2019s offered to add an extra layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.\u00a0Check out my best expert-reviewed password managers for 2025 here.",
      "7) Monitor for suspicious activity and use identity theft protection: Genetic data leaks can lead to identity theft or medical fraud. Consider signing up for an identity theft protection service that monitors personal information, such as your Social Security number, phone number and email, alerting you if this data is found on the dark web. Some identity theft services also include up to $1 million in identity theft insurance to cover losses and legal fees and a dedicated fraud resolution team with a U.S.-based case manager to help you recover any stolen assets or identity.\u00a0See my expert recommendations here: Best identity theft protection services for 2025 here.",

      "Do you remember Apple\u2019s\u00a0\"Privacy. That's iPhone\" marketing campaigns? If you\u2019re not aware, the company likes to portray its products as being synonymous with privacy. However, the recent wave of security vulnerabilities affecting iPhones and Macs suggest Apple\u2019s products may not be as secure as advertised.",
      "A recent security blunder only reinforces this point. Security researchers discovered that Apple\u2019s built-in password manager app, Passwords, was vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months after launch. This meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a lookalike phishing site to steal your login credentials.",

      "Security researchers at\u00a0Mysk, noticed that Apple's Passwords app, introduced with iOS 18 in September 2024, had a significant security flaw that left users vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months.",
      "The app used unencrypted HTTP connections instead of the more secure HTTPS to fetch logos and icons displayed alongside stored passwords. This allowed attackers on the same network, such as public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport, to intercept these requests and potentially redirect users to phishing sites designed to steal login credentials.",
      "The issue remained unresolved from iOS 18\u2019s launch in September 2024 until Apple fixed it in December 2024, leaving users exposed for nearly three months. If someone opened the Passwords app and tapped a link, like \"Change Password,\" while connected to an insecure network, an attacker could intercept the request and redirect them to a fraudulent site mimicking a legitimate one, such as a fake Yelp login page. Since the app did not enforce HTTPS, users might not notice the switch, putting their sensitive information at risk.",

      "1) Use a reliable password manager:\u00a0Apple apps are generally more secure than third-party options, but the Passwords app clearly wasn\u2019t. The fact that the security vulnerability existed for three months before Apple fixed it proves that Apple needs to put more emphasis on keeping customer data secure. I\u2019d suggest opting for a reliable password manager instead of relying on Apple\u2019s offering. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): It\u2019s good to have a password manager, but you know what\u2019s even better? 2FA.\u00a0Adding an extra layer of security with 2FA can prevent hackers from accessing your accounts, even if they steal your password. Use authentication apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or hardware security keys instead of SMS-based codes, which are vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "3) Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities and use a VPN:\u00a0Hackers can exploit unsecured public networks to intercept your login credentials. If you must access sensitive accounts on\u00a0public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and prevent attackers from snooping on your data. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Beware of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0You can have all the protection in the world but a phishing email or SMS can still cause havoc. Hackers often use fake login pages to trick you into entering your credentials. Always verify URLs before entering login details, avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Keep your devices updated: Regularly\u00a0update your devices and software to ensure you have the latest security patches.",

      "APPLE RELEASES EMERGENCY SECURITY UPDATE FOR SERIOUS VULNERABILITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Three months is a long time for a security flaw in a password manager to go unpatched, especially from a company that presents itself as a leader in privacy and security. This incident highlights a troubling reality. Apple\u2019s security measures are not infallible, and even built-in system apps can expose users to serious risks. While the fix eventually arrived, it should not have taken this long for such a fundamental issue to be addressed. If Apple wants to maintain its privacy-first image, it needs to do better by ensuring more rigorous security testing before launch.",

Well, this International Women\u2019s Day, I learned something that should be concerning to us all. Fully\u00a096% of all deepfakes \u2014 artificial intelligence-generated images and videos that use someone\u2019s likeness \u2014 are pornographic and target women without their consent.",
      "One well-known case involved an Australian law student who discovered that manipulated pornographic images of her were being shared online when she was just 18. But this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. According to a\u00a0recent survey of women in the U.S., AI deepfakes are among the types of online abuse that a significant number of women face despite being a relatively new technology.",
      "But this isn\u2019t the only type of online abuse women face.",
      "According to the same survey, one in four women in the U.S. say they\u2019ve experienced online abuse, including cyberbullying, doxxing, sexual harassment, trolling and AI deepfakes.

However, it also indicates that women use it more than men.",
      "Data privacy also plays a role. A recent study showed younger generations are generally less concerned about keeping their personal information private compared to older generations. Growing up in a digital-first world, many younger people appear to be desensitized to data collection and are more willing to share personal information online.

      "The U.S. military had shot down several Houthi drones a short time before the group's claim.",
      "The latest claims come after several Trump administration officials discussed plans for a forthcoming military strike against the Houthis in a group chat on the encrypted messaging service Signal in which they mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, who said he received a request to join the group on March 11 from what appeared to be the president's National Security Advisor Michael Waltz.",
      "The group, called \"Houthi PC Small Group,\" featured top Trump officials discussing what turned out to be an upcoming attack on the Houthis, as many are criticizing the group chat as a massive breach of national security and note that senior officials are not supposed to discuss detailed military plans outside special secure facilities or protected government communications networks.",

      "The article noted that officials were discussing \"war plans,\" and Goldberg said he elected not to publish some of the highly sensitive information he saw in the Signal chat, including precise information about weapons packages, targets and timing, because of potential threats to national security and military operations.",
      "The editor also said that Ratcliffe put the name of a CIA undercover agent into the Signal chat.",
      "The Houthis said they had targeted a U.S. vessel and Israeli military locations using drones. (AP)",

      "\"I've heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said Monday.",
      "Hegseth criticized Goldberg as \"a deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again, to include the, I don't know, the hoaxes of Russia, Russia, Russia, or the fine people on both sides hoax or suckers and losers hoax.

      "President Donald Trump warned the Houthis in a Truth Social post Tuesday that \"HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE\" if they did not stop their attacks.",

      "The statement said that, of the top 10 importers by value of trade through the Red Sea, five were EU nations. But it also said the Houthis have attacked U.S. warships 174 times and commercial vessels 145 times since 2023. The Houthis responded that they were ready to \"respond to escalation with escalation\", though no response has been seen so far.",

    "summary": "Mass layoffs are expected to begin at HHS, hitting workers at agencies including the CDC, FDA and NIH. The firings come under health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of federal workers were bracing for pink slips Friday as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. begins dismantling the sprawling federal agency responsible for protecting America's health.",
      "Some 10,000 full-time jobs were on the chopping block as part of\u00a0the White House\u2019s \u201creduction in force\u201d plan to effectively shutter or downsize a number of divisions under the HHS umbrella.",
      "HHS oversees 13 agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. Overall, the cuts will shrink the health department\u2019s workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 when combined with its earlier layoffs, Andrew Nixon, a senior spokesperson for HHS, said Thursday.",
      "Targeted workers said it's likely to get ugly.",
      "\u201cNo matter what happens, this is going to be a bad day,\" a CDC official told NBC News, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. \"It feels like we\u2019re participating in the 'Hunger Games' reaping.\u201d",
      "The layoffs add to growing evidence that Kennedy, who tried to strike a moderate tone during his Senate confirmation, is set to pursue an agenda that could radically reshape public health across the U.S.",
      "Kennedy has long talked about dismantling the federal public health infrastructure. During his failed run for president, he vowed to hollow out the CDC and the NIH. Elon Musk\u2019s project, the Department of Government Efficiency, has provided a Trump-endorsed plan to make that dream a reality and set the stage for him to remake the health agencies in his image.",
      "The cuts come as Kennedy has begun to exercise his influence on HHS priorities. Earlier this week, NBC News reported that the CDC was preparing to hand vaccine safety data to a discredited researcher who has spread misinformation regarding vaccines and autism. The FDA recently canceled a meeting about flu shots, and Kennedy has downplayed the importance of vaccination in Texas amid a measles outbreak.",
      "But even before the first HHS worker was sent packing Friday, the reduction rollout had been marked by chaos, CDC officials said.",
      "Requests from center directors for early or even simultaneous notice of the cuts were ignored by HHS, according to one senior official, who said leadership was learning about layoffs and division closings from reports in the media and relying on their staffers to let them know if they received termination notices.",
      "Experts warned that wholesale staffing cuts would be hazardous to maintaining public health.",
      "\u201cMaking America Healthy Again sounds great, but that\u2019s not possible when HHS is hollowed out with major staff and funding cuts,\" said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.",
      "\"Loss of career scientists will have long-term consequences for public health and safety,\" Gostin said. \"It will be very difficult to rebuild the public health workforce. In my view, these cuts are dangerous and shortsighted. Public health is invisible but it saves lives every day.\u201d",
      "Earlier, NBC obtained a memo that revealed that HHS workers would be notified as early as Friday whether they would be laid off.",
      "HHS said Thursday that 28 divisions in the health department contain \u201credundant units,\u201d and that the restructuring plan will consolidate them into 15 divisions.",
      "\u201cWe will eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments, while preserving their core functions by merging them into a new organization called the Administration for Healthy America or AHA,\" Kennedy said in a post on X.",
      "Among the agencies set to be folded into the AHA include the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, which includes a program focused on HIV treatment.",
      "Meanwhile, the divisions being eliminated or reduced at the CDC include those focused on global health,\u00a0domestic HIV prevention\u00a0and injury prevention, such as gun violence, HHS said Thursday.",
      "In total, the CDC will decrease its workforce by about 2,400 employees, Nixon said Thursday. The administration will also move the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which\u00a0manages the nation\u2019s emergency stockpile, from HHS to the CDC, he said.",
      "Also facing big cuts are the FDA, NIH and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "The FDA will decrease its workforce by about 3,500 full-time employees; the NIH headcount will be reduced by 1,200 employees; and CMS will lose about 300 workers.",
      "Nixon said the reorganization of CMS will not affect Medicare and Medicaid, nor will it affect the timeline for the FDA\u2019s review of drugs, medical devices and food.",
      "The latest expected mass layoffs are separate from earlier attempts by the Trump administration to fire thousands of probationary employees at the CDC and other federal agencies. Two federal judges have since ordered the temporary reinstatement of many of those affected workers."

      "Federal prosecutors accused Javice, 32, of \"falsely and dramatically\" inflating the number of her company's customers to entice JPMorgan Chase into buying it. The company, Frank, was supposed to make it easier to file for financial aid through the government's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).",
      "She was indicted in 2023 on charges of\u00a0securities fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy, two years after JPMorgan Chase bought her startup for $175 million.",
      "Javice could face a maximum of 30 years in prison on the charges of wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy. Securities fraud carries a slightly lower maximum sentence of 20 years.",
      "Jennifer Roberts, head of Chase consumer banking, told CNBC at the time of the 2021 acquisition that the goal in buying Frank was to expand its connection to college students and have \"lifelong, engaged relationships\" with the rising consumer base.",
      "However, the deal began to unravel after the financial institution attempted to obtain information on the purported 4.25 million Frank users, finding that Javice only had verifiable data for about 300,000, prosecutors said.",
      "During closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Chiuchiolo told the jury that Javice hired an outside person to fabricate consumer data after her head of engineering refused.",
      "Her attorney, Jose Baez, described the prosecution's case as \"incredibly flawed\" and lacking in evidence. Javice was not called to testify in the case.",
      "Olivier Amar, Javice's chief growth officer, was also charged in the case as a defendant. He didn't testify at trial, and his attorneys attempted to distance Amar from Javice.",
      "Prosecutors accused Amar of working with Javice to defraud JPMorgan Chase during the merger deal, but Amar's defense was that Javice acted on her own, according to Bloomberg."

      "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 It\u2019s a race against the clock for the Tampa Bay Rays as they prepare to open their doors to fans at their temporary new home this Major League Baseball season.",
      "With the Rays\u2019 opening day game Friday, the team is working tirelessly to remove any signs of the New York Yankees, the original tenant of Steinbrenner Field. From covering up logos to swapping the nameplates of players like Aaron Judge and Anthony Volpe to Taj Bradley and Shane McClanahan in the clubhouse, to reorganizing the merchandise shops \u2014 it\u2019s all part of the effort to make the Tampa Bay Rays players and fans feel at home this season.",
      "\u201cWe have over 3,000 unique pieces of art that will be going up \u2026 a total makeover of the clubhouse to turn that into kind of the home of the Rays,\u201d said Bill Walsh, chief business officer for the Tampa Bay Rays. \u201cSo just an extraordinary effort going in this week.\u201d",
      "Now visible from outside the stadium is a massive \u201cRays Up\u201d banner with \u201cThank you, Yankees!\u201d written in smaller text underneath. The iconic sign spelling Y-A-N-K-E-E-S in navy-and-white letters across both baselines, a staple in this ballpark since its opening in 1996, is now covered with Rays logos in a slightly different shade of blue.",
      "Even the hanging \u201cNY\u201d logo in the locker room has been covered by a square \u201cHome of the Rays\u201d banner. But every part of the Rays\u2019 makeover is just temporary. Per their agreement with the Yankees, the Rays will return Steinbrenner Field exactly as it was at the end of this season.",
      "Walsh says there\u2019s more than just rebranding behind his team\u2019s effort to get the job done.",
      "\u201cHaving home field advantage is such an important thing in all sports, but in baseball especially,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re gonna play 81 games here. That is an enormous number of games. It is a grind for our players, for their families, for our staff. And an important part of mitigating that is having this place feel comfortable.\u201d",
      "The Tampa Bay Rays announced in November that they would play their 2025 season at George M. Steinbrenner Field following the devastation from Hurricane Milton at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg. In a statement, Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg said, \u201cThe hurricane damage to Tropicana Field has forced us to take some extraordinary steps, just as Hurricanes Helene and Milton have forced thousands of families and businesses in our community to adapt to new circumstances as we all recover and rebuild.\u201d",
      "Kat Lucas, the director of game presentation with the Rays, has been working for the team since 2017 and saw the post-hurricane destruction firsthand.",
      "\u201cJust being torn to pieces and just shredded like that, it was pretty unimaginable,\u201d she said.",
      "No one inside the ballpark was injured during the storm, but the damage was deemed too great to be fixed by the spring.",
      "Reflecting on the storm six months later, Walsh called it \u201cshocking.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was very emotional that night. And then the days after, I think, like most of us, it seemed overwhelming. On top of that, personally, I was very lucky, but so many of our staff also were dealing with really significant issues on the personal side, whether that be flooding or damage to their homes. And so it was a huge organizational challenge.\u201d",
      "The Rays looked elsewhere for a temporary home and ended up 22 miles away, across the bay in Tampa.",
      "Now, Lucas is looking forward to the new possibilities and challenges of working in an outdoor ballpark.",
      "\u201cBeing inside of a dome, we were a little limited on what we could do, like fireworks, a flyover, something that you become accustomed to at large stadiums,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this season, we get to bring that to our fans.\u201d",
      "And for the first time, Rays players and fans will have to adjust to Florida\u2019s brutal summer temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns.",
      "\u201cInside Tropicana Field, it was always 72 degrees,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI always knew what to expect, and \u2026 I\u2019m actually looking at the forecast ahead of time, and being like, \u2018All right, do I have to plan for a weather delay?\u2019 ... So this is a new adventure for all of us.\u201d",
      "Another curveball: Tropicana Field could seat roughly 45,000 fans compared to Steinbrenner Field\u2019s 10,000 seats.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a significant revenue challenge,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cWe have the same payroll on the field, and we have to find those revenues from somewhere. \u2026 [Only having] 10,000 seats in this venue \u2026 that creates a real revenue ceiling for us.\u201d",
      "But despite these concerns on Tuesday, the Rays announced Friday\u2019s 2025 regular season home opener is already sold out.",
      "With just hours to go until that first pitch, the Rays\u2019 director of equipment and clubhouse operations, Tyler Wall, is confident they\u2019ll make the deadline.",
      "\u201cOh, we\u2019ll be ready. I got the utmost confidence in my entire crew here and the entire organization,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys will see different departments running around all day long, and it\u2019s a culmination of everybody working together to be ready on Friday.\u201d"

Those declines put both indexes on pace for their fifth weekly decline in six weeks, with the Nasdaq breaching its prior low for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.7%",
      "Since President Donald Trump's election in November, the S&P has declined about 5.9%, while the Nasdaq has fallen about 8.7%.",
      "The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported earlier Friday that a reading of inflation favored by the Federal Reserve climbed more than expected in February, suggesting the central bank's effort to keep interest rates higher to head off steeper price increases was running into resistance. A separate survey from the University of Michigan showed soaring inflation expectations among consumers as they continued to digest the threat from President Donald Trump's tariffs strategy.",
      "The same report showed a surge in forecasts for higher unemployment over the next year, while expectations of being better off financially in a year hence tanked.",
      "Those trends ran headlong into increasing concerns on Wall Street about the payoff from the massive investments in artificial intelligence that have occurred over the past two years or so and fueled some gains in the stock market.",
      "Shares in chipmaker Nvidia were down nearly 2% Friday and are now down 27% from their January high, erasing some $1 trillion in value.",

      "\u201cThanks to the significant investments we have made up to this point, we are well positioned to meet our current and increasing customer demand,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said, adding that last year the company increased its capacity more than in any other year in its history.",
      "\u201cWhile we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis allows us to invest and allocate resources to growth areas for our future.\u201d",
      "The Microsoft report came as the price sought for an AI-related initial public offering was trimmed. Reuters reported that cloud-computing group CoreWeave had slashed the proposed price range and number of shares to be sold in its planned IPO this week, and indeed the stock opened trading Friday below the target range it had sought.",
      "\u201cThe market is getting squeezed by both sides. There is uncertainty around next week\u2019s reciprocal tariffs hitting the major exporting sectors like tech alongside concerns about a weakening consumer facing higher prices hitting areas like discretionary,\u201d Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, told CNBC.",

      "On Feb. 16, Petrova returned from France to Boston's Logan Airport from a work trip and passed through immigration without issue. But while awaiting her luggage, two Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers took her into a room to inspect her luggage and searched her phone, her lawyer said.",
      "Inside, officers found a sample of frog embryos from her research.",
      "\"They find a sample, scientific sample of frog embryos that she was bringing at the request of her principal investigator, her professor at Harvard, from the lab in France that they are collaborating with,\" Romanovsky said. \"She had that in her luggage, and she did not declare it.

      "Instead, CBP gave Petrova two choices. The first was to withdraw her application for admission to the U.S. and leave voluntarily, with the opportunity to go to an embassy in another country and apply for a visa to re-enter the U.S. The second was that CBP would issue an order of expedited removal, and she\u2019d be put on a plane back to Paris. However, due to a ban on re-entry under an order of deportation, she wouldn't be able to return to the U.S. for at least five years.",
      "Romanovsky said she chose to withdraw her application for admission.",
      "\"Please put me back on the plane to France, I\u2019m going to do what you tell me to do. I\u2019m going to apply for a visa. I want to do the right thing,\" Petrova said at the time, according to her lawyer. \"And they said, 'Okay, that\u2019s fine. Would you like us to notify the Russian government of what happened today, or the Russian Consulate?'\"",
      "Her lawyer said Petrova told them not to notify the Russian consulate, saying, \u201cI cannot go to Russia. I will be persecuted there.\u201d",
      "Petrova has a history of persecution there over her political activity, Romanovsky said.\u00a0She was arrested in Russia in 2022 for protesting the Ukraine war, The Harvard Crimson reported.",
      "\"She has been detained there, and her detention and her social media activity will almost certainly ensure a nice, hefty jail sentence for her, so at that point when she said, \u2018I can\u2019t go back to Russia,\u2019\" he said.",
      "Her arrest comes amid a Trump administration crackdown on immigration, including revoking hundreds of student visas and appearing to target scholars for activism. Many of those individuals had been involved in free speech protests on campuses decrying human rights violations in Gaza in the Israel-Hamas war. Petrova's case appears unique, however, as her activism is not related to the Israel-Hamas war, but opposing the Russian war in Ukraine.",
      "Romanovsky said CBP then followed what's called a credible fear process where noncitizens can claim they have a credible fear of persecution or torture and request asylum in the U.S. In that case, the individual is asked to present their case before an immigration judge.",
      "\"This is where she\u2019s at right now, she has established credible fear,\" the lawyer added.",
      "She\u2019s now waiting for a hearing before an immigration judge in Jena, Louisiana, set for May 7.",
      "However, even if the immigration judge grants asylum, the government can appeal and they can continue to keep her in detention.",
      "\"I would love to say that she\u2019s going to know where she stands in a couple of months, and she\u2019ll be out if she gets approved, but we don\u2019t know that,\" Romanovsky said.",
      "At the same time, Romanovsky said, they have a pending lawsuit filed against the Department of Homeland Security and CBP in the District of Vermont \u2014where she was detained before being transferred to Louisiana. The hearing for the lawsuit, which alleges improper visa revocation and her initial detention, is scheduled for June 9.",
      "A DHS spokesperson told NBC News on Friday that Petrova was \"lawfully detained after lying to federal officers about carrying biological substances into the country.\"",
      "\"A subsequent K9 inspection uncovered undeclared Petri dishes, containers of unknown substances, and loose vials of embryonic frog cells, all without proper permits,\" the spokesperson said. \"Messages found on her phone revealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them. She knowingly broke the law and took deliberate steps to evade it.\"",
      "Romanovsky advocating for Petrova's release from ICE as she awaits her immigration court hearing.",
      "\"She\u2019s certainly a victim of the new policy where people are held indiscriminately, held and not released, regardless of whether they\u2019re a threat to anybody or whether flight risk,\" Romanovsky said. \"There\u2019s really no sense to continue to hold her she\u2019s just taking up bed space. She\u2019s not a danger to the community. She\u2019s not a flight risk.\"",
      "He described Petrova as a \"brilliant scientist\" and a \"very, very sweet person. She\u2019s a very good friend, and she\u2019s a very trustworthy, reliable, and kind individual.\"",
      "Romanovsky said her principal investigator at Harvard asked the attorney to give letters from Nobel Prize winners in support of Kseniia.",
      "Harvard confirmed in a statement Friday that she is a research associate at Harvard Medical School, saying, \"We are monitoring this situation.\""

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 13:31:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Duke's star freshman Cooper Flagg has been the consensus top pick in the upcoming NBA Draft since before the season started.",
    "story": [
      "Duke's star freshman Cooper Flagg has been the consensus top pick in the upcoming NBA Draft since before the season started. During the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament this month, the 6-foot-9 wing from Maine\u00a0has done nothing to tamp down the sky-high expectations.",
      "In the NBA, \u201che may be your third-best scorer, yet your most valuable player in the sense of everything he does,\u201d said a college scout for an NBA team, who asked not to be identified because his team, like every other in the league, does not allow scouts to comment publicly on prospects.",
      "After scoring 14 points in Duke\u2019s opening victory of the tournament, and 18 in the second round, Flagg produced such a bravura 30-point performance Thursday in Newark, New Jersey, that it pushed the top-seeded Blue Devils past Arizona and left his coach talking in superlatives.",
      "Flagg appeared comfortably in command during the high-stakes, single-elimination tournament while adding a season-high seven assists, plus six rebounds and three blocks.",
      "\u201cThat was one of the best tournament performances I\u2019ve ever coached or been a part of,\u201d Duke coach Jon Scheyer, who notably played on a Blue Devils team in 2010 that won the NCAA championship, said during his postgame news conference.",
      "Arizona forward Henri Veesaar said: \u201cHe\u2019s a freak athlete.\u201d",
      "Halfway through the tournament, Flagg has averaged 20.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 6.0 assists, shooting 47% from the field while turning the ball over just four times in 88 minutes. Given the ankle injury Flagg suffered less than a week before the tournament began hasn\u2019t stopped him, the next, logical question is whether anything, or anybody, will be able to.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing that stands out is he can impact the game without scoring,\u201d the scout said. \u201cThat\u2019s not his main thing. It\u2019s the defense, playmaking. Without dominating the ball and without scoring he has a huge impact on the game.\u201d",
      "Flagg\u2019s tournament performances have confirmed the potential that NBA evaluators have expected to see since July 2024, when Flagg arrived in Las Vegas to play with a select group of the best young U.S. basketball players.",
      "This wasn\u2019t your typical offseason pickup game, because their opponent was USA Basketball\u2019s senior men\u2019s team as it practiced ahead of the Paris Olympics.",
      "In front of a private practice watched by a crowd of a few hundred agents, coaches, and team and league executives, Flagg, who was only 17 at the time, held his own. He swished a pull-up 3-pointer in front of NBA All-Star Anthony Davis and soared past another top defender, Bam Adebayo, for a put-back basket.",
      "\u201cHell of a player,\u201d future Hall of Fame star Kevin Durant said during a\u00a0news conference\u00a0after the scrimmage. \u201cSeventeen years old, coming in here and playing like he\u2019s a vet almost.\u201d",
      "The NBA has attempted to disincentivize teams from intentionally weakening themselves, and thus the league\u2019s product. Until 2018, the team with the worst record was awarded a 25% chance of landing the No. 1 draft pick. Since 2019, however, the league has flattened the top-pick odds, awarding the three worst teams the same 14% chance. Atlanta won the No. 1 pick last year despite ending the 2024 season with a 3% chance of doing so.",
      "That hasn\u2019t kept teams from flailing for Flagg, the ACC\u2019s player of the year and a candidate for national player of the year. Not since Carmelo Anthony led Syracuse to the 2003 NCAA championship in his lone college season has a freshman acted as the engine of a national title contender to this degree.\u00a0After shooting 32% on 3-pointers through his first 20 games, he has shot 41% in his last 14, showing the ability to stretch the floor that NBA teams covet.\u00a0Over the same 14-game span since Feb. 1, Flagg has produced more steals (20) and blocks (19) than turnovers (18).",
      "\u201cHis shooting has gotten so much better,\u201d Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said in his postgame news conference Thursday. \u201cHe makes 3 of 5 from three today, 9 of 10 from the free-throw line. And just his ability to playmake.\u201d",
      "The combination has led fans to salivate about what Flagg might do next. By early April, Duke could stand as college basketball\u2019s champion. By June\u2019s NBA Draft, the league\u2019s biggest losers in the standings hope it will be their turn to celebrate."

    "summary": "Immigrant children who survived sex abuse are being stripped of legal aid to help them stay in the U.S. due to HHS federal funding cuts, according to legal groups.",
    "story": [
      "A pregnant 16-year-old girl who had been a victim of sex trafficking since she was 6 crossed the border from Mexico seeking to prevent the same kind of abuse from happening to her child.",
      "A Los Angeles-based group gave legal help to the immigrant teen and her 1-year-old toddler so they could stay safely in the U.S. The group is part of a string of organizations that on Wednesday sued the U.S. Department of\u00a0 Health and Human Services for \u201cshutting down critical legal representation programs for unaccompanied immigrant children.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat kind of system do we have when our government is more willing to pay an attorney to deport a child than it is to provide the same child with an attorney whose job is to protect their rights?\u201d Alvaro Huerta, director of litigation and advocacy for Immigrant Defenders Law Center, said in a statement. The lawsuit was filed in a California federal district court.",
      "President Donald Trump touted during his campaign last year that he protected children and women from human trafficking in his first term. But attorneys say his current administration has put thousands of children in danger by ending funding for lawyers that help them through immigration court  processes.",
      "For many immigrant children, the lost legal help could mean being separated from families, guardians or sponsors who are or could care for them in the U.S. and preventing them from ending up back in abusive, and possibly deadly situations, attorneys argue.",
      "By canceling the contract to fund the groups providing legal help, organizations representing the children have been forced to lay off lawyers, search for other ways to fund the legal help or, ultimately, withdraw from cases.",
      "Huerta\u2019s organization, which helped the teen sex trafficking victim and her baby, has already been forced to give layoff notices to 27 of its staffers to try to stay financially viable and help as many clients as possible, according to the lawsuit. The group Estrella Del Paso, in El Paso, Texas, furloughed 18 of 28 employees in its unaccompanied children program and the Galveston-Houston Immigration Representation Project (GHRIP) will have to lay off most of the 19 employees providing services to unaccompanied children.",
      "One of GHRIP\u2019s clients is a 2-year-old child who arrived with her teenage mother, also an unaccompanied minor who was a victim of abuse. GHIRP managing attorney Alexa Sendukas told NBC News  she's attempting to get a special immigrant juvenile status for the toddler, a multistep process that involves seeking a determination from a local juvenile court that it\u2019s not in the child\u2019s best interest to return her to her home country.",
      "Getting permanent legal status for the child could take five years or more, but the funding cuts jeopardize Sendukas\u2019 ability to stay on the case, she said. GHIRP has about 300 unaccompanied children clients whose legal representation was paid for by the funding that\u2019s been cut off. The organization is trying to determine what it can do, because attorneys also have ethical obligations that complicate withdrawing from cases.",
      "The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests from NBC News for comment on the lawsuit and on the legal groups\u2019 criticism of the funding cuts and their projected effects on the children.",
      "On a potential deportation track",
      "Some children who have fled trafficking, violence, starvation and  abuse are being stripped of legal aid to help them stay in the U.S. as the Trump administration has made them a priority for deportation, the immigrant legal groups said.",
      "NBC News reported last month that the Trump administration was planning to locate and potentially deport unaccompanied children.",
      "Left at risk are children such as a 12-year-old boy from Central America with a severe disability that impairs his ability to speak. Emily Norman, managing director of the Hartford, Connecticut, office of Kids In Need of Defense, KIND, has been representing him.",
      "His mother died, his father was physically abusive and the boy was forced to work since he was even younger, while enduring bullying for his disability, Norman said. He was eventually abandoned by his father, and a family member who brought him to the U.S. cannot care for him anymore, she said.",
      "After months of weekly, lengthy meetings, the boy has started to be able to communicate and KIND was about to begin the process of helping him apply for special immigrant juvenile status, a designation for children under 21 who have been abused, abandoned or neglected.",
      "Though the special status can lead to legal permanent residency, the boy is now in deportation proceedings in immigration court. \u201cNow we\u2019ve lost the funding and we cannot continue to represent him,\u201d Norman said.",
      "\u201cMy worst fear is he is going to be deported back to a country where he has no one to take care of him and he can\u2019t communicate. How is he even going to ask for help if he needs it?\u201d Norman said, her voice becoming emotional.\u00a0\u201cWe have so many kids in this position and now we are going to have to call them and tell them, \u2018We said we were going to be there for you and now you are on your own.'\"",
      "Only about 1 in 5 of the estimated 118,000 unaccompanied children in the U.S. have legal representation, leaving many of them to show up in court alone or with a parent, guardian or sibling who may not speak English or isn't likely to have much more of an understanding of the language themselves, according to Bilal Askaryar, a spokesperson for Acacia Center for Justice.",
      "Acacia, whose contract with the government was not renewed, had subcontracted more than 100 groups around the country, including KIND, to provide legal help to about 26,000 unaccompanied children.",
      "Attorneys with the groups who've lost funding said their clients have begun to get notices to appear for immigration court hearings, even if the child is in the midst of getting some form of protection from deportation and permission to remain in the U.S. Some children are also ending up on \u201crocket dockets\u201d a term for\u00a0accelerated deportation processes, according to Acacia Center for Justice.",
      "The Trump administration will now share the immigration status of adults who sponsor unaccompanied children with law enforcement and the Office of Refugee Resettlement. This means ORR can decide not to release children to sponsors \u2014 parents, guardians or family members \u2014 because the sponsor doesn\u2019t have legal immigration status.",
      "The impact of some of the recent changes are beginning to surface.",
      "\u201cWe have seen situations where loving family members who have cared for the children previously are seeking to sponsor them out of our custody and are unable to, and it\u2019s leading to increased requests for transfer to long-term foster care,\u201d Sendukas of GHIRP said. \u201cWe\u2019ve even seen increased requests from children for voluntary departure because they believe there\u2019s no one who can receive them and they\u2019ll be detained forever.\u201d",
      "'Left on their own'",
      "During his first term, Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that culminated with separating children from their parents or guardians drew heavy backlash. While attorneys who spoke to NBC News were unwilling to equate the stripping of legal representation to border separations, several said the new policy would traumatize children, many of whom have already been repeatedly traumatized.",
      "Kayleen Hartman, KIND\u2019s managing attorney for family unity, focuses on children who have been separated from their parents. Hartman said she is \u201cfinding it heartbreaking\u201d that she may have to end representation for a girl who was about 7 years old when she was \u201cphysically, tearfully, forcefully\u201d separated from her father under Trump\u2019s policy by agents and officers who didn\u2019t speak her and her father\u2019s Indigenous language.",
      "The father was deported and the girl was sent to a foster care home where she was reprimanded for not speaking and understanding Spanish, according to Hartman. She was relocated to the home of distant relatives and bounced around other households, before ending up with another distant relative, where she was sexually assaulted by a male family member, Hartman said. The girl told a friend of the assault and the friend's mother informed state child welfare workers, who put the girl in foster care. That\u2019s when KIND picked up her case, Hartman said. KIND used a process made possible by the Biden Family Unification Task Force to reunite her with her father in the U.S.",
      "Hartman said she and her team are \u201cscrambling\u201d to get temporary legal status set up for the girl before KIND has to close the case, but immigration backlogs make it impossible to get this done quickly.",
      "Almost all the clients they\u2019re currently sitting down with to tell them they can\u2019t be their attorneys any longer \u201care clients with a background and a history of trauma,\u201d\u00a0Hartman said. \u201cThese are kids that have been abandoned and left on their own.\u201d",
      "KIND has about 4,400 cases that were supported by funding from Acacia Center for Justice.\u00a0Wendy Young, KIND\u2019s president, said the funding cutoff means the group has had to downsize, laying off a number of staffers. The group is now trying to place cases with private sector pro bono partners but, in most cases, KIND will have to withdraw, Young said.",
      "The result will be that children won\u2019t show up for proceedings and won\u2019t get protections for which they may be eligible.",
      "\u201cThis administration is driving us back 30 years,\u201d Young said, a time \u201cwhen children were forced to navigate a complex adversarial immigration system in a courtroom by themselves, regardless of whether they were 2 years old or 6 years old.\u201d"

      "Renewed inflation fears, plummeting consumer confidence and rising doubts about the payoff from artificial intelligence touched off  a fresh round of heavy selling in stocks Friday.",
      "The broad S&P 500 closed down 2% for its second-worst day of 2025, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2.7%. Those declines put both indexes on pace for their fifth weekly decline in six weeks, with the Nasdaq breaching its prior low for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.7%",
      "Since President Donald Trump's election in November, the S&P has declined about 5.9%, while the Nasdaq has fallen about 8.7%.",
      "The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported earlier Friday that a reading of inflation favored by the Federal Reserve climbed more than expected in February, suggesting the central bank's effort to keep interest rates higher to head off steeper price increases was running into resistance. A separate survey from the University of Michigan showed soaring inflation expectations among consumers as they continued to digest the threat from President Donald Trump's tariffs strategy.",
      "The same report showed a surge in forecasts for higher unemployment over the next year, while expectations of being better off financially in a year hence tanked.",
      "Those trends ran headlong into increasing concerns on Wall Street about the payoff from the massive investments in artificial intelligence that have occurred over the past two years or so and fueled some gains in the stock market.",
      "Shares in chipmaker Nvidia were down nearly 2% Friday and are now down 27% from their January high, erasing some $1 trillion in value.",
      "Earlier in the week, a Wall Street report alleged Microsoft\u00a0had abandoned plans for new data center projects in the U.S. and Europe, suggesting the appetite for increased spending on AI was slowing. In a statement, Microsoft did not directly deny the report.",
      "\u201cThanks to the significant investments we have made up to this point, we are well positioned to meet our current and increasing customer demand,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said, adding that last year the company increased its capacity more than in any other year in its history.",
      "\u201cWhile we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis allows us to invest and allocate resources to growth areas for our future.\u201d",
      "The Microsoft report came as the price sought for an AI-related initial public offering was trimmed. Reuters reported that cloud-computing group CoreWeave had slashed the proposed price range and number of shares to be sold in its planned IPO this week, and indeed the stock opened trading Friday below the target range it had sought.",
      "\u201cThe market is getting squeezed by both sides. There is uncertainty around next week\u2019s reciprocal tariffs hitting the major exporting sectors like tech alongside concerns about a weakening consumer facing higher prices hitting areas like discretionary,\u201d Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, told CNBC.",
      "Helfstein added, however, that the news on inflation and consumer spending \u201cwas not that bad\u201d and could simply represent a hiccup in near-term sentiment as investors struggle to understand the Trump administration\u2019s new policies.",
      "\u201cDespite today\u2019s selloff and broader market volatility of the past few weeks, there have not been big inflows into money markets. It seems like a lot of investors are trying to ride this out,\u201d he said."

      "He also served a stint in the San Antonio Spurs organization, eventually becoming head coach of the Spurs G League team in Austin.",
      "Jenkins\u2019 arrival in Memphis coincided with the Grizzlies drafting Morant with the No. 2 overall pick in 2019. Memphis made the postseason three straight seasons from 2021 to 2023. Then the Grizzlies went through a season plagued with injuries to major players.",
      "Morant played only nine games because of a 25-game league suspension and a right shoulder injury that ended his season. Fellow guard Desmond Bane missed considerable time with a left ankle sprain, and frontline reserve Brandon Clarke managed only six games because of a left Achilles tendon tear.",

      "Again, Jenkins spent another season piecing together lineups around Morant limited to 43 games with various illnesses, soreness, contusions and sprains. Morant missed Thursday night\u2019s game, his sixth straight, with a strained hamstring."

      "Lululemon\u00a0beat Wall Street expectations for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, but issued 2025 guidance that disappointed analysts.",
      "On an Thursday earnings call, CEO Calvin McDonald said the athleticwear company conducted a survey earlier this month that found that consumers are spending less due to\u00a0economic and inflation concerns, resulting in lower U.S. traffic at Lululemon and industry peers. However, he said, shoppers responded well to innovation at the company.",
      "\u201cThere continues to be considerable uncertainty driven by macro and geopolitical circumstances. That being said, we remain focused on what we can control,\u201d McDonald said.",
      "Shares of the apparel company plunged 15% on Friday morning.",
      "Lululemon was only the latest retailer\u00a0to say it expects slower sales\u00a0for the rest of this year as concerns grow about a weakening economy and President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Even so, the Canada-based company said it expected only a minimal hit to profits from the U.S. trade war with countries including Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "Here\u2019s how the company did compared with what Wall Street was expecting for the quarter ended Feb. 2, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:",
      "Earnings per share:\u00a0$6.14 vs. $5.85 expectedRevenue:\u00a0$3.61 billion vs. $3.57 billion\u00a0expected",
      "Earnings per share:\u00a0$6.14 vs. $5.85 expected",
      "Revenue:\u00a0$3.61 billion vs. $3.57 billion\u00a0expected",
      "Fourth-quarter revenue rose from $3.21 billion during the same period in 2023. Full-year 2024 revenue came in at $10.59 billion, up from $9.62 billion in 2023.",
      "Lululemon\u2019s fiscal 2024 contained 53 weeks, one week longer than its fiscal 2023. Excluding the 53rd week, fourth-quarter and full-year revenue both rose 8% year over year for 2024.",
      "Lululemon expects first-quarter revenue to total $2.34 billion\u00a0to\u00a0$2.36 billion, while Wall Street analysts were expecting $2.39 billion, according to LSEG. The retailer anticipates it will post full-year fiscal 2025 revenue of $11.15 billion\u00a0to\u00a0$11.30 billion, compared to the analyst consensus estimate of $11.31 billion.",
      "For the first quarter, the company expects to post earnings per share in the range of $2.53 to $2.58, missing Wall Street\u2019s expectation of $2.72, according to LSEG. Full-year earnings per share guidance came in at $14.95\u00a0to\u00a0$15.15 per share, while analysts anticipated $15.31.",
      "CFO Meghan Frank said on the Thursday earnings call that gross margin for 2025 is expected to fall 0.6 percentage points due to higher fixed costs, foreign exchange rates and U.S. tariffs on China and Mexico.",
      "Lululemon reported a net income for the fourth quarter of $748 million, or $6.14 per share, compared with a net income of $669 million, or $5.29 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2023.",
      "Comparable sales, which Lululemon defines as revenue from e-commerce and stores open at least 12 months, rose 3% year over year for the quarter. The comparison excludes the 53rd week of the 2024 fiscal year. Analysts expected the metric to rise 5.1%.",
      "Comparable sales in the Americas were flat, while they grew 20% internationally. Lululemon has been facing a\u00a0sales slowdown\u00a0in the U.S., although McDonald said its U.S. business stabilized in the second half of the year and partially attributed the improvement to new merchandise. He added that Lululemon will expand its stores to Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Turkey and the Czech Republic this year.",

      "More than 4,200 people were killed from July to February, and another 1,356 were injured, the report found. It was issued after William O\u2019Neill, the U.N. human rights commissioner\u2019s expert on Haiti, recently visited the troubled Caribbean country.",
      "While much of the violence has been unleashed by gangs who formed a coalition last year known as \u201c\u00a0Viv Ansamn,\u201d a growing number of people are being killed by\u00a0self-defense groups\u00a0and mobs, including at least 77 suspected gang members slain in November after gunmen tried to attack a community in the Port-au-Prince capital, the report stated.",
      "It also found that the number of people killed and injured by authorities fighting gangs \u201cremained extremely high.\u201d",
      "More than 2,000 people were killed during police operations from July to February, a 60% increase compared with the 1,253 killings reported from February to July of 2024.",
      "Some 73% of victims killed by law enforcement were reportedly gang members, but 27% \u201cwere not associated with gangs and were often struck by stray bullets while in the streets or at home,\u201d the report said. It noted that in some cases, police opened fire from armored vehicles \u201cwhere people were walking or selling goods on the streets.\u201d",
      "It also said police have been reportedly involved in summary executions of suspected gang members, their families, \u201cor individuals who, when intercepted, were unable to provide identification or offer a sufficient explanation for their presence in the area.\u201d",
      "The report stated that nearly 1,000 firearms belonging to Haiti\u2019s National Police have been diverted in the past four years, and that credible sources have said officers are selling some weapons on the black market.",
      "A police spokesperson did not immediately return a message requesting comment.",
      "The report said gangs also obtain illegal weapons from private security companies that use them.",
      "Overall, an estimated 270,000 to 500,000 illegal weapons are circulating across Haiti.",
      "\u201cThe use of these firearms has fueled a destructive cycle of violence in Haiti, leading to severe human rights abuses,\u201d the report stated.",
      "Detecting and seizing illegal weapons remains a challenge given what the report said was severe underfunding and understaffing at Haiti\u2019s customs and police departments, as well as a lack of resources and technology coupled with corruption and lack of oversight.",
      "It noted that a U.N.-backed mission led\u00a0by Kenyan police to help fight gangs in Haiti\u00a0has only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel envisioned.",
      "One Kenyan officer, Samuel Tompoi Kaetuai,\u00a0was killed in February\u00a0in Haiti\u2019s central Artibonite region. A second officer, identified by Haiti\u2019s government as Benedict Kabiru, is considered dead\u00a0after he went missing\u00a0when gangs attacked his group on Monday as they tried to rescue Haitian police stuck in a ditch that officials believe was dug on purpose by gunmen."

      "Barry Ritholtz\u00a0had a hard time writing his first book, \u201cBailout Nation.\u201d",
      "Drafted in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, the biggest challenge, he said, was that a different company \u201cwould blow up\u201d every week.",
      "It felt as if the writing \u201cwas never over,\u201d said Ritholtz, the chairman and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management, an investment advisory firm that\u00a0manages\u00a0more than $5 billion of assets.",
      "By comparison, the new book was a \u201cjoy\u201d to write, largely due to the benefit hindsight, said Ritholtz, who is also a prolific blogger and creator of the long-running finance\u00a0podcast\u00a0\u201cMasters in Business.\u201d",
      "The book, \u201cHow Not to Invest: The Ideas, Numbers, and Behaviors That Destroy Wealth \u2014 And How to Avoid Them,\u201d published March 18, is a history lesson of sorts.",
      "Ritholtz looks back at anecdotes across pop culture and finance \u2014 touching on Hollywood titans like Steven Spielberg, music sensations like The Beatles, and corporate pariahs like Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos \u2014 to illustrate the disconnect between how much people think they know and what they actually know. (Ritholtz\u2019 point being, The Beatles and films like \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d were initially panned; Holmes, initially lauded, is now serving jail time.)",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge advantage to say, \u2018I know how the game ended,\u2019\u201d Ritholtz said. \u201cWhat the analysts were saying in the second, third, fourth inning, they didn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "CNBC spoke to Ritholtz about why people are often bad investors, why famous investors like Warren Buffett are \u201cmutants,\u201d and why financial advice about buying $5 lattes is the clich\u00e9 that just won\u2019t die.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "How to be 'miles ahead of your peer investors'",
      "Greg Iacurci: Your No. 1 tip to being a better investor is to avoid mistakes \u2014 or, as you write, \u201cmake fewer unforced errors.\u201d What are some of the most damaging unforced errors you often see?",
      "Barry Ritholtz:\u00a0Let\u2019s take one from three broad categories: Bad ideas, bad numbers and bad behaviors.",
      "Bad ideas are simply, wherever you look, people want to tell you what to do with your money. It\u2019s a fire hose of stuff. Everybody is selling you some bulls*** or another. And we really need to be a little more skeptical.",
      "On the numbers side, the biggest [mistake] is simply: We fail to understand how powerful compounding is. A lot of the dumb things we do get in the way of that compounding. Cash is not a store of value. It\u2019s a medium of exchange, and you shouldn\u2019t hold on to cash for very long. It should always be in motion, meaning you should be paying for your rent or mortgage with it, paying your bills and your taxes, whatever recreational stuff you want to do, whatever philanthropy you want to do and whatever investing you want to do. But money shouldn\u2019t just sit around.",
      "Compounding is exponential. When I ask people, \u201cIf I\u2019d invested $1,000 in 1917 in the stock market, what\u2019s it worth today?\u201d You look at what the market\u2019s returned \u2014 8% to 10%, with dividends reinvested \u2014 $1,000 a century later is worth $32 million. And people simply can\u2019t believe it. Ten percent [reinvested dividends] means the money doubles every 7.2 years.",
      "The biggest [behavioral error] is simply, we make emotional decisions. That immediate emotional response never has a good outcome in the financial markets. It is exactly why people chase stocks and funds up and buy high, and why they get scared and panic out and sell low.",
      "If you just avoid those three things, you\u2019re miles ahead of your peer investors.",
      "Not all plays are 'Hamilton'",
      "GI: Going back to something you mentioned about how relentless bad financial advice is, what are some memorably bad pieces of financial advice or investment opportunities you\u2019ve come across?",
      "BR:\u00a0I get a lot of weird things \u2014 plays, restaurants. You should know, most plays are not \u201cHamilton\u201d and most restaurants are not Nobu. These are really, really difficult investments. Those are all the winners. You\u2019re not seeing the other million products in the same space that didn\u2019t make it.",
      "I think we have this really distorted viewpoint of the world that allows us to believe that finding a giant winner is much easier than it really is. And that is because you don\u2019t see the endless fails, the restaurants that implode, the plays that close after opening night. All these little investment opportunities that come along, and the people selling [them], the advice they\u2019re giving, they\u2019re always weird and quirky. A great restaurant is a really good business, but most restaurants are terrible businesses, and that\u2019s a hard thing for people to recognize.",
      "The financial 'clich\u00e9 that refuses to die'",
      "GI: There\u2019s this great part in the book where you talk about\u00a0the $5 coffee: The thought being, if you invest that money instead of buying coffee, you\u2019ll basically be a millionaire. You write that it\u2019s the \u201cclich\u00e9\u00a0that refuses to die.\u201d Why do you think it\u2019s detrimental for people to think this way?",
      "BR:\u00a0$5, really? I don\u2019t want to come across as a completely detached one percenter, but if a $5 latte is the difference between you having a comfortable retirement or not, you\u2019ve done something very, very wrong.",
      "Let\u2019s say you do put $5 away. If you saved $5 every day and invested it, it adds up to something. But when you look out 20, 30, 40, years, the other side of the spending equation is, what\u2019s my income going to be? How much am I going to earn? If you\u2019re going to show me $5 compounding over 30 years, you also have to show me where my income is going to be. If I\u2019m looking at this as a 30-year-old, what\u2019s my income going to be at 60? How will my portfolio, my 401(k) \u2014 and if I have kids, my 529 [college savings] plan \u2014 how will that have compounded over the same time? If you\u2019re only looking at the $5 latte but ignoring everything else \u2014 and that\u2019s before we even get to inflation \u2014 it looks like a chunk of money but it really isn\u2019t.",
      "The big philosophical problem that I\u2019ve found is most of the spending scolds don\u2019t understand what the purpose of money is.",
      "GI: What is the purpose of money?",
      "BR:\u00a0Money is a tool. First, lack of money certainly creates stress. You can worry about paying the bills, and if you have a kid, how am I going to pay for their health care? Not having sufficient money to pay the rent, buy food, pay for health care, is certainly stressful. The first thing money does is it chases away the lack-of-money blues.",
      "Money [also] creates optionality. It gives you choices. It gives you freedom. It allows you to not do many of the things you don\u2019t want to do. And it allows you to buy time with friends and family experiences and to create memories.",
      "It\u2019s the ability to spend your time how you want, with who you want, doing whatever work you want, or no work at all, if you eventually get to that point.",
      "GI: What should people do to make investing as simple as possible and have good outcomes?",
      "BR:\u00a0[Vanguard Group founder] Jack Bogle figured this out 50 years ago. If you want to find the needle in the haystack \u2014 if you want to find the Apples, Amazons, Microsofts, Nvidias, J.P. Morgans, United Healthcares and Berkshires [of the world] \u2014 don\u2019t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the whole haystack.\u00a0(Editor\u2019s note: The \u201chaystack\u201d here refers to\u00a0buying an index fund that tracks the broad stock market\u00a0rather than trying to pick winners.)",
      "You make the core part of your portfolio a broad index, and then you put whatever you want around it.",
      "So, start out with a basic index, be very tax-aware of what you do, and then back to the behavioral stuff: Don\u2019t interfere with the market\u2019s ability to compound.",
      "The crazy thing about Warren Buffett: His wealth has doubled over the past seven years. Think about how insane that is. He\u2019s 94, like half of his wealth came about from zero to [his late eighties], and the other half came about in the last seven years. That\u2019s the miracle of compounding.",

      "And if you're wondering how we can possibly know that \u2014 Grande is actually only 31 \u2014 just check out her new 26-minute science fiction short film/music video, \"Brighter Days Ahead.\"",
      "In the video, an elderly-appearing Grande is wheeled into a futuristic facility where she's allowed to view four stored memories for the last and final time. If that premise sounds a little like the 2004 film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" you're spot-on. She's playing Peaches again, a character she originally portrayed in last year's \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love),\" only this is a much older version.",
      "The \"Spotless\" connection is a natural; \"Brighter Days\" is a companion piece of art connected to her \"Eternal Sunshine Deluxe: Brighter Days Ahead\" album, which came out in March. The short film is directed by Grande and Christian Breslauer (who also directed videos for \"We Can't Be Friends\" and \"The Boy Is Mine,\" which also released in 2024, as Rolling Stone reports).",
      "In the video, memories are released like clear lottery balls down a ramp.  Viewers then see everything from old family home movies (it's hard to determine how much, if any, of them are actually Grande's real-life home movies) to a modern day Grande singing \"Eternal Sunshine.\" She also gives young-Grande takes on recent songs \"Dandelion,\" \"Twilight Zone,\" \"Supernatural,\" and \"Hampstead,\" all of which tell different pieces of her history.",
      "The description in the YouTube video notes that it's been 70 years since Peaches was last seen (in her previous video), and she's returned to Brighter Days for her memory visit.",
      "\"As Peaches embarks on this immersive journey, we watch her confront and heal certain wounds (personal and professional alike) that have made her who she is today,\" the description reads.",
      "\"She reconnects with her younger self who had been patiently in the wings for over a decade, as she works her way through the challenges of fame (she is the daughter of the very famous Brighter Days Inc. founder/doctor), personal sensationalism (resulting in being torn apart by stray cats), and generational trauma,\" the description continues. \"In the end, with the help of her loved ones and art, she is able to come home to herself. She would do anything to experience it all again. However, there\u2019s one catch: once a memory is relived, it is erased forever.\"",
      "And stay tuned until after the fourth memory is destroyed in the short film for a delightful last comment.",
      "But why riff so hard on the Jim Carrey/Kate Winslet movie? As Grande told Apple Music in a 2024 interview, the mix of romance and memory was extremely powerful for her.",
      "\"I think the movie is so beloved because so many people can relate to knowing that something isn't right, but loving so much, and wanting to stay, and wanting to figure it out, and that cycle that can happen in the film,\" she said. \"I think that's why the film is so beloved. It's because so many people can relate to it, and I think it kind of fell into place that these songs had little tidbits of that theme. I just felt really inspired by it.\"",
      "Grande is on quite a roll, thanks in part not just to the \u201cEternal Sunshine\u201d release (and the \u201cDeluxe\u201d addition), but she was also nominated for an Academy Award in early 2025 for her work in \u201cWicked.\u201d"

      "\"Draco Malfoy and the Mortifying Ordeal of Being in Love\" was the first \"Harry Potter\" fan fiction she wrote. (Across fandoms, \"I think I've written about 2 million words of fan fic over the past 20 years,\" she notes.) The story strikes the tone of a romantic comedy and imagines Hermione as a valuable healer and Draco, her former nemesis from their time at Hogwarts, as an Auror (essentially a magical law enforcement official) assigned to protect her.",
      "When she finished the story, Knightley recalls feeling happy with it. But she was left with an \"itch,\" she says.",
      "\"That was an enemies-to-lovers story of two people who had a really rough history,\" she says. \"I wanted enemies to lovers that were like systemically enemies to lovers. I wanted them to hate each other just by virtue of what they were.\"",
      "The result is \"The Irresistible Urge to Fall in Love,\" which she describes not as an adaptation of her fan fiction but an original work that is \"Dramione-coded\" or has \"Dramione vibes.\"",
      "\u201cI wrote it because I came off a fan fic, and I was like, 'OK, I did that dynamic, but I'm looking for this other one.' And I didn\u2019t have, for once in my life, some sort of IP in mind,\u201d she says. \"So it really was written as an original work.\"",
      "\"The Irresistible Urge to Fall for Your Enemy\" is a slow burn romantic fantasy that follows an ailing assassin, Osric, who has to seek help from a healer named Aurienne, even though their respective orders \u2014\u00a0the Fyren and Haelan, respectively \u2014 are opposites in every way.",
      "The book, which comes out July 8, will kick off the \"Dearly Beloathed\" duology.",
      "The romance is a true slow burn \u2014\u00a0\"They think about killing each other like for the first 10 chapters,\" Knightley says \u2014\u00a0and is set in a version of 19th century England with a form of magic called seith.",
      "Fans of \"Draco Malfoy and the Mortifying Ordeal of Being in Love,\" never fear: Knightley's original fan fiction will stay up on Archive of Our Own.",
      "While having a markedly different plot, \"The Irresistible Urge to Fall For Your Enemy\" will hit all her signature \"beats,\" Knightley says.",
      "\"I always have these steps of like denial and yearning and will they/ won't they ... It's similar to all of my slow burns, not specifically 'Mortifying,'\" Knightley says.",
      "\"When I get to write a stupid idiot who's in denial about his feelings, I am so happy,\" she adds.",
      "Read an excerpt of \u2018The Irresistible Urge to Fall For Your Enemy\u2019",
      "In the following excerpt, Osric (a member of the Fyren Order of assassins) goes to meet Aurienne (a member of the Haelan Order of scholar-healers). She has \u2014 tersely \u2014 ordered him to join her at a clinic so she can assess his illness. He is furious to have been abruptly summoned, especially in daylight. She is aggravated to have to work with a morally bankrupt assassin. The\u00a0ensuing conversation goes as well as you\u2019d imagine... - Brigitte Knightley",
      "Osric, provoked, took the nearest waystone to the designated pub. First, he was at nobody\u2019s beck and call, least of all this priggish Haelan\u2019s. Second, it was broad daylight, and he hated operating in broad day- light. Third, between the name of the pub and the signs for a clinic for spotty bums that he was now following through this gods-forsaken little hamlet, he rather felt that she was taking the piss.",
      "The villagers puttering about gave Osric startled looks as he stalked through the hamlet\u2019s streets, his hood up, his greatcoat flaring behind him.",
      "What part of my condition mustn\u2019t be discovered hadn\u2019t this idiot understood?",
      "He found the final spotty-bum sign and knocked upon the clinic door.",
      "The idiot opened the door.",
      "Fairhrim\u2019s greeting consisted of a look. There was a lot in it; she looked at Osric as though he were a wart that had acquired sufficient sentience to knock on doors.",
      "\u201cAre you bloody serious?\u201d asked Osric.",
      "Fairhrim, taken aback by the wart\u2019s rudeness, straightened. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d",
      "\u201cSummoning me? In broad daylight? In a public place? I told you that my condition mustn\u2019t be discovered.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been discovered,\u201d said Fairhrim. \u201cYou\u2019re hooded up like death personified. And anyone who did see you will think you\u2019re suffer- ing from folliculitis.\u201d",
      "Osric pointed at one of the overly detailed posters that had haunted his walk. \u201cYou had to choose arse acne?\u201d",
      "\u201cTo guarantee us privacy,\u201d said Fairhrim. She held the door open. \u201cGet in.\u201d",
      "Osric stepped into the tired little consultation room. The place was lit with new electric lights far too bright for his liking. There was an examination table against the wall. Miscellaneous medical parapherna- lia was scattered about, looking both curative and foreboding, rather like Fairhrim herself.",
      "Her travelling cloak was clasped shut with a silver wing. She re- moved it to reveal her stiff Haelan dress, high about the neck and impec- cably white, save for the sharp silver epaulettes.",
      "\u201cAlso,\u201d said Osric, removing his own cloak, \u201cI\u2019m not at your beck and call. Don\u2019t summon me like this again.\u201d",
      "Fairhrim grew rigid. She turned to him and spoke with a false sort of brightness. \u201cOh? And I\u2019m at yours, am I? You can impose meetings on me, in abandoned barns, at midnight, without offering me any kind of alternative, but meeting during perfectly normal hours under a per- fectly well-thought-out pretext in a perfectly suitable location presents difficulties, does it? I showed your schedule the same respect you showed mine; didn\u2019t you like it?\u201d",
      "She fixed him with a Look. Osric developed a new understanding of what gimlet-eyed meant.",
      "Osric decided not to die on this particular hill. \u201cPerhaps we can each make improvements to our scheduling habits when it comes to the other\u2019s calendar.\u201d",
      "\u201cA compromise?\u201d asked Fairhrim.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d said Osric, assuming that this was a positive thing.",
      "It was not. Fairhrim sniffed in Osric\u2019s direction, as though manure from the barn still wafted from him. \u201cI\u2019ve compromised enough just being here today. But, nevertheless, we can compromise. Now, disrobe.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d",
      "\u201cDisrobe,\u201d repeated Fairhrim. Then, slower: \u201cRemove your clothes.",
      "There are gowns in the cupboard. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d",
      "She left the room before Osric could make an argument. Nudity in the face of her ongoing animosity felt unwise. But refusal felt\u2014well, pathetic. She was only a Haelan and she was by herself.",
      "Was she by herself? What if she came back with a Warden when he was stark bollock naked? She reeked of hostility.",
      "He would keep his weapons close at hand.",
      "Osric began to undress. This was no small task. After much unclip- ping, unbelting, and unstrapping, he removed the following inventory from his person: twelve throwing knives, his blaecblade, two back- swords, one amputator, and, finally, a dozen syringes and vials contain- ing substances as nasty as they were illegal.",
      "These items he placed upon the examination table with care.",
      "He was less precious about his clothes: waistcoat, shirt, collar, cra- vat, trousers, underthings, and boots were all tossed towards a chair.",
      "Osric opened the cupboard to discover that the gowns were, judging by their colour and size, intended for little girls, rather than men who liked to cultivate an air of sinister elegance.",
      "He pulled a faded pink thing on, which, when placed over his head, left his dangly bits exposed.",
      "He decided to wrap the gown around his hips like some sort of kilt.",
      "Thus attired, he leaned against a cabinet, looking as suave as one could in a strip of puce-coloured linen, to await Fairhrim\u2019s return.",
      "He felt, once again, that Fairhrim was taking the piss. No one took the piss out of Osric Mordaunt with this level of frequency and noncha- lance. She was lucky that she was necessary to him at this moment; he would\u2019ve murdered her for the cheek otherwise.",
      "The Means to an End knocked, and her crisp voice asked, \u201cReady?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Osric. Should the Haelan have brought company to at- tack him while he was naked, he had throwing knives threaded between his fingers.",
      "Fairhrim swept into the room. Her hard eyes passed over Osric and rested on his knife-bristling fists.",
      "\u201cReally?\u201d was her unimpressed comment. \u201cI can assure you that if I\u2019d planned any harm to you, it would\u2019ve happened already.\u201d",
      "Well. That was cocky.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got a high opinion of yourself,\u201d said Osric.",
      "\u201cDeserved, I assure you,\u201d said Fairhrim. She jutted her chin towards his gown. \u201cThat is quite the ensemble.\u201d",
      "\u201cFetching, isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
      "\u201cDid you try the adult cupboard?\u201d asked Fairhrim. \u201cWhat adult cupboard?\u201d asked Osric.",
      "\u201cThe one you\u2019re sitting on.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Osric.",
      "(He had not tried the adult cupboard.)",
      "Fairhrim advanced into the room with a critical air that made Osric feel like he was back in the barracks as a young Fyren, awaiting his warchief\u2019s inspection.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to need the examination table, if you wouldn\u2019t mind moving this\u201d \u2014 Fairhrim made an impatient gesture towards Osric\u2019s weapons \u2014 \u201cmess of an arsenal.\u201d",
      "Osric moved his things under Fairhrim\u2019s watchful eye.",
      "\u201cIs there a single inch of you that isn\u2019t covered in scar tissue?\u201d she asked.",
      "Osric looked down at himself \u2014 at his chest, decorated by reminders of various blades; at his forearms, ridged by burns; at his shins, scat- tered with memories of a long-ago explosion.",
      "\u201cThere is,\u201d said Osric. \u201cA few inches, actually. Under the kilt.\u201d"

      "\"Aimee Lou is British. Aimee Lou is like my sister. So we're very close, so we talk a lot, and do voice memos to each other,\" Bibb says. \"I think it was maybe the first episode or something, and she sent, 'My friend wanted me to tell you that he's f------- loving you and your c----y little bob.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kiana Moore is forging her own path as a filmmaker.",
      "After winning the 2022 best feature film Tribeca X Award for \u201cThe Beauty of Blackness,\u201d with co-director Tiffany Johnson, Moore set her sights on sitting in the director\u2019s chair solo for her next big project.",
      "Similar to her previous works, like \u201cA Woman\u2019s Place,\u201d a documentary short about the gender biases women face in the culinary industry, and \u201cInto the Mix,\u201d a podcast created to inspire the next generation of activists, Moore continues to focus on underrepresented groups in her new film, \u201cSensory Overload.\u201d",
      "In this project, Moore, who serves as the vice president of content production and head of Epic Stories at Vox Creative, hopes to shine a light on sensory sensitive and neurodivergent communities in an effort to educate the masses about them, while also debunking stigmas.",
      "For some, the doc will be a first look at the day-to-day life of someone in the neurodivergent and sensory sensitive (communities). It shows how people who are neurodivergent, a nonmedical term to describe someone whose brain works differently, and sensory sensitive, or someone who has a heightened sensitivity to sensory input, aren\u2019t that much different than those who are not.",
      "Someone who is neurodivergent may be seen as having different strengths and challenges in comparison to others, according to Cleveland Clinic. Those possible strengths can include \u201cbetter memory\u201d and an ability to \u201csolve complex mathematical calculations,\u201d while potential differences can include \u201cmedical disorders, learning disabilities and other conditions,\u201d per the clinic.",
      "Moore tells TODAY.com that regardless of how these communities process information, they should be regarded as capable and included versus being judged and marginalized.",
      "\u201cBoth communities have so much to contribute, and they just need us to be open to the way in which they can contribute,\u201d Moore says.",
      "Now, with her project available to watch on Hulu, Moore is sharing more about her story and why she\u2019s not putting a limit on the stories she wants to tell.",
      "Read on to learn more about Moore and the vision behind \u201cSensory Overload.\u201d",
      "The following Q&A has been condensed for clarity.",
      "A: When we first started working on this campaign over a year ago, we were still trying to figure out what we were going to create, so we started with a story hunt \u2014 which is a process that (we use) to find nonfiction stories that we want to tell. ... Once we decided on the stories that we wanted to focus on in a feature length documentary, my team and I worked on crafting those stories into one cohesive film.",
      "Because we were working so closely together \u2014 and because I was working so closely with the cast \u2014 I felt like I should direct this documentary because I was there from the beginning. I knew the characters, I knew what they wanted to say, and I was very adamant about making sure that we told the story the right way.",
      "As someone who is dyslexic \u2026 I had a connection with some of the characters, and I do have sensory sensitivities. Now, I also, from this documentary, realize that I have a lot of sensory-seeking traits. I only realized that after talking to these amazing people. I really felt connected to them. I felt protective of them. I wanted to make sure that their stories were told correctly and resonated with anyone who watched the film, and that is why I decided to direct.",
      "A: I do have experience with the neurodivergent community. My godson is neurodivergent, and he means the world to me. One of my nephews is also neurodivergent, and I have had other situations where I have worked with neurodivergent people. The neurodivergent community is common to me. It is like a second skin. I am used to being around them, being an accomplice, and an ally for what they may need or making sure that the spaces they are in are more inclusive.",
      "But I didn\u2019t have experience nor know the language of sensory sensitivity until this documentary. Now that I have been a part of this piece, know the language and how to engage, and know how to actually be supportive, I feel that much better of a person \u2014 a better human so that I can also be an ally. We all need someone in the room who will speak up for us, especially when we are not there, but to also speak for us when we are there but we feel voiceless.",
      "To that point, experts and industry leaders are critical voices in this conversation \u2014 those who can speak on behalf of individuals. That\u2019s why, in tandem with the film, the Sensodyne Sensory\u00a0Inclusion Initiative launched in partnership with American Dental Association and sensory accessibility nonprofit KultureCity.",
      "We all need someone in the room who will speak up for us, especially when we are not there, but to also speak for us when we are there but we feel voiceless.\u201d",
      "kiana moore",
      "A: I think the biggest misconception is that they are a hindrance, they are an annoyance, they take up space that they don\u2019t need to take up, and that we have to somehow tolerate them. That is not true at all.",
      "Both communities have so much to contribute, and they just need us to be open to the way in which they can contribute. All of us have special skills. Someone who is an amazing pianist needs a piano to play. If they do not have one, or if they are playing the bass or the violin, they would not be able to express their skill fully, even though they have the ability and willingness to be great. We need to realize that there is greatness in all people. If we give people the tools, society will get to see them flourish.",
      "Making a space sensory friendly does not impact society negatively at all. But more importantly, it now allows people with sensory sensitivities to also thrive.",
      "A: I will be selfish and hope to win an Oscar for the best documentary. In all seriousness, professionally, I am content and blessed with where my career is going, and I just hope that people see this and trust me and my team to create more amazing content. I hope this film achieves understanding and engagement with (these communities). I hope that people watch this film and realize that if they need to speak up, that if they feel a part of this, they have the right to speak up, ask questions, and make situations more accommodating and inclusive. And, if a person doesn\u2019t have sensory sensitivities and they see someone struggling, maybe they will have a little bit more empathy and understanding, and then maybe help make a situation more inclusive."

Barbershop \u2014 Day\" and \u201cYou Lookin\u2019 for Me?\u201d \u2014 he addresses the infamous slap he gave Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscars.",
      "In \u201cInt. Barbershop \u2014 Day,\" which features DJ Jazzy Jeff and B. Simone on the track, the song begins with a mix of voices speaking about Smith being \"canceled\" after the Oscars incident and some of the backlash and rumors that followed amid the controversy.",

      "It's important to note that Smith was not required to return his Oscar after the incident, but was instead banned by the Academy from attending any event related to the organization for 10 years.",
      "Smith later resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science and issued a statement apologizing, saying in part, \u201cChange takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason.\u201d",
      "\u201cInt.

      "In Smith's \u201cYou Lookin\u2019 for Me?,\u201d the actor once again references his Oscars controversy, noting he \"won't get nominated\" -- though multiple outlets have reported that Smith is eligible to be nominated and win Oscars in the 10-year period, \"though he can\u2019t show up to accept them.\"",
      "\u201cTook a lot, I\u2019m back on top, y\u2019all gon\u2019 have to get acclimated / Won\u2019t stop, my s---\u2019s still hot even though I won\u2019t get nominated / Personal life with my wife, mind your business, it\u2019s complicated / All that matters is the fact that I\u2019m still getting compensated.\u201d",
      "\u201cBased on a True Story\" is Smith's first full-length solo music project in 20 years, but it's not the first time he addressed what happened at the Oscars.",
      "After the altercation, he issued an apology to Rock\u00a0in a lengthy statement he posted\u00a0on Instagram.",
      "\u201cI would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris.\u00a0I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness,\u201d the statement read in part."

      "After 11 episodes apart, Eddie Diaz has finally reunited with his son, Christopher, on \"9-1-1.\"",
      "Season Eight, Episode 12, of the ABC drama picked up three weeks after Episode 10, when Eddie (Ryan Guzman) moved back home to El Paso, Texas, to reunite with Chris (Gavin McHugh), who left Los Angeles at the end of Season Seven.",
      "The episode, titled \"Disconnected,\" also saw dispatcher Maddie Han (Jennifer Love Hewitt) deal with the aftermath of her kidnapping.",
      "At the end of the midseason premiere, Maddie was taken from her home by police detective Amber Braeburn (Abigail Spencer), who turned out to be the serial killer Maddie and Sgt. Athena Grant (Angela Bassett) had been looking for all along.",
      "Once firefighter husband Howie \"Chimney\" Han (Kenneth Choi) set out to try and rescue Maddie, and put himself in harm's way, she gave up trying to talk down Amber and fought back, starting a clash that resulted with her throat being slashed.",

      "As she reels from being separated from her job, Eddie similarly struggles to find his footing in Texas. His house is proving to be a major fixer-upper, and he isn't able to join a local fire station in El Paso amid a hiring freeze. So, he trades in his tricked-out truck for a sedan with better gas mileage to become an Uber driver \u2014 a development he keeps from his parents and Chris.",
      "That is, until his son is the one hopping in the back of his car for a ride.",

      "While Eddie's texts to his son go unanswered, Chris surprises his dad by showing up at his house unannounced. The 14-year-old says he wants Eddie to stay in El Paso. Eddie then apologizes for lying about his current profession, telling Chris, \u201cI just wanted you to be proud of me.\u201d",

      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "To remind her where her power is, really.",
      "I just thought it was interesting. By being attacked the way she was, having her throat cut, that does sort of temporarily take away her voice, but then it becomes, like a psychological version of that. I sort of like the metaphor that Maddie's voice \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s the thing that people hear over that phone, and it\u2019s a tether to hope or death. So that voice is really her superpower.",
      "So we had several different versions of how her voice came back, and pretty much all of them were predicated on her child. But we did have what I felt were, like, sort of convoluted ways that it happened.",
      "And then I think it may have been (writer) Molly Green\u2019s idea to have her just be out in a public place. And a thing that any parent can actually really relate to is you turn around for a split second and you look back and you have that moment of panic, because it\u2019s like, \"Wait, where\u2019d my kid go?\"",
      "So, when she really needed her voice, it came back. And it\u2019s really because of the things that Athena was saying to her in a previous scene. That she has to wrestle with her own fear on her job, but then she thinks about the people that need her, and she muscles through. And that\u2019s exactly what happens to Maddie in that moment.",
      "I think Eddie feels like a bit of an outsider in his life. So I think what it would have looked like is kind of what you're seeing, where Eddie is going over to his parents' house for family dinners. His mother in particular is sort of taking on the role of parent, and so she's almost treating Eddie and Christopher like they were both her sons \u2014 almost treating Eddie like he's Christopher's brother, as opposed to his father.",
      "But the first thing Eddie needs to do is kind of like lay down some roots and get his house ready so that Christopher can move in.",
      "But his whole story so far has been that he doesn\u2019t want to spook his kid. He\u2019s approaching this in \u2014 I\u2019m not even advocating that he\u2019s made the right choice here \u2014 but he\u2019s approaching this in a very circumspect way. And he just, he wants to make sure that it\u2019s Chris\u2019 choice to come back. I think his mother in particular is kind of leveraging that against him a little bit.",
      "I think he is learning Father Brian\u2019s lesson.",
      "But I think this instance is very different than what happened with him in LA. He was lying to everybody by omission. He\u2019s kind of doing that again.",
      "Eddie seems to have some patterns here. I think Eddie needs to work on that. Now that I think about it, he sort of lets people believe what they believe.",
      "It's a little bit different here because he was withholding something intentionally in the Kim storyline. Here, it's more that he didn't mean to give the wrong impression, but he's too afraid to correct that mistake.",
      "It means everything. The door is now open for Eddie. Now he just needs to walk through it.",
      "Well it's the very next episode, so I don't necessarily want to spoil it, but Eddie needs to dad up, and that is the story that we tell in the next episode.",
      "Eddie and his relationship with his parents vis-\u00e0-vis Christopher is very much the focus of Eddie's story in the next episode.",
      "The episode is called \"Invisible.\" And the characters feel invisible, and even Hen feels invisible, which is unusual for Hen. But there\u2019s just a really nice story of Hen doing what she does best, which is bonding on a human level with a patient, with a character who's feeling unseen, and she helps him to feel more seen, and it doesn\u2019t quite go as she expects.",
      "I don\u2019t think their dynamic really has changed. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly, I\u2019ve been writing these characters the same since Eddie\u2019s introduction, since the beginning of Season Two. And I think they were on good, solid ground when they parted at the end of Episode 10.",
      "What I would say is, there\u2019s a thing that happens in tonight's episode, where Buck has the opportunity to encourage Eddie to come back to LA. Eddie, in a weak moment, or in a vulnerable moment, I should say, when his job situation is not panning out the way he had hoped, suggests that maybe he should just come back and do his old job, because he\u2019s not living with his kid anyway, and he needs to provide for him. And it\u2019s Buck who says, \"You can\u2019t come back.\"",
      "So I think what you see, and it's subtle, is a little growth for Buck. Like this time, he didn\u2019t have to hem and haw, he didn\u2019t have to go adopt an animal. He just said the thing that Eddie needed to hear. And it was at a, you know, not a huge price for Buck, but he really was just thinking about the other person in this instance, and I think that's growth.",
      "It's always a trick, when you're in Season Eight of something, and you're continuously putting your characters in peril, that you do want to feel like there's fallout, that there are stakes, that the things that happen to them matter.",
      "The stakes are very high going forward for the rest of the season. And not just for one character.",
      "I mean I think it would be revisited should the need for the reading of a will arrive.",
      "But you know I'm quite sure Eddie doesn't share every move he makes with his parents. And so I would not assume that they know that at all.",
      "Family, faith and loyalty, I think for both of them."

      "When chatting about the singer capturing the country\u2019s heart on Season One of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d Kelce read a tweet from a fan that said, \u201cIt\u2019s wild to me that 'American Idol' found America\u2019s best vocalist on their FIRST TRY.\u201d",
      "Clarkson laughed after hearing the compliment before revealing that she views her time on the show differently than her fans.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know it was a TV show until my third audition,\u201d she shared. \u201cNobody knew it was going to amount to anything.\u201d",

In 2018, she became a coach on Season 14 of NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice.\u201d She remained in her spinning red chair until Season 21.

      "The 42-year-old said she likely won\u2019t return to \u201cThe Voice\u201d any time soon. Clarkson opened up about exiting the show in an interview with USA Today in 2023.",
      "\u201cFull disclosure, I put on a smile a lot of those times because I was struggling a lot in my personal life,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about what I\u2019m capable of handling, and also what you should not handle. That was me saying \u2018bye\u2019 to \u2018The Voice\u2019 and having this big move. I love that family, but I was like, \u2018I\u2019m struggling. I can\u2019t smile anymore. I don\u2019t feel like smiling.\u2019\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The chance to draw Betty White for a U.S. postage stamp was an easy \u201cyes\u201d for Boston-based illustrator Dale Stephanos.",
      "\u201cI said \u2018yes\u2019 before they finished the sentence,\u201d he recalls in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "White died in 2021 at the age of 99. Now, the late actor, known for her roles in \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d and \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d is being honored with Forever Stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service starting March 27.",
      "The stamp celebrates White\u2019s decades-long entertainment career and her advocacy for animals, an element subtly woven into Stephanos\u2019s design.",
      "For Stephanos, who has spent decades creating portraits for outlets like Rolling Stone, Mad Magazine, and Sports Illustrated, the Betty White stamp was particularly meaningful. The illustrator learned his conception for the stamp had been approved just days before his mother died.",
      "\u201cThis is now a very, very personal piece for me,\u201c he says. \u201c(My mother) got to see her son do something really cool.\u201d",
      "Stephanos recalls gathering around a television with his family to watch White on TV. His grandmother had also been named Betty, and in her final days, his mother, despite being in poor health, saw the design go viral.",
      "Stephanos recognized something familiar in White\u2019s trademark blend of wit and warmth \u2014 qualities that reminded him of home.",
      "\u201cShe reminded me of my mother. She had this real ability to say something, and then jaws would drop, and people would be like, \u2018Did she really just say that?\u2018\u201c he says. \u201cShe\u2019s one of those people who could get away with things that a lot of people couldn\u2019t because she was an older lady, and she had that sweet smile, and it\u2019s delivery \u2014 it was never mean. It was never mean. It was always good humor, even when she was roasting somebody.\u201d",
      "For the stamp, Stephanos drew inspiration from a portrait of White taken by Kwaku Alston in 2010. Alston\u2019s photograph shows White in the later part of her career, wearing red, eyes bright with her signature spark.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a great photo \u2014\u00a0a sweet spot in her older years,\u201c he says. \u201cI just kind of used that as reference and then kind of changed the colors and tried to make it more handmade than a photo would be.\u201c",
      "Stephanos\u2019 image is a stylized portrait of White dressed in purple instead of red to reflect a deeper part of White\u2019s legacy.",
      "\u201cPurple is the color of protest. She had such a positive personality. She never seemed angry, even though protest is a form of anger,\u201d he says.",
      "Even the earring he chose for White was selected with care.",
      "Stephanos sought a subtle way to reflect Betty White\u2019s animal advocacy in the stamp after her estate requested it be part of the design. One morning, Stephanos noticed his wife\u2019s animal-print dress and shiny earrings. He looked down and realized he had drawn a paw print, and an idea clicked.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, wait a minute. We could just do a paw print earring,\u201d he says.",
      "The small but meaningful detail was ultimately approved and became part of the final stamp, which can be seen on White\u2019s right ear in the portrait.",
      "Stephanos thinks of stamps as \u201clittle pieces of art\u201d that \u201cdress up our correspondence.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know when I get something with an interesting stamp, I take a second, I look at it and appreciate it. I think it\u2019s one of the great things that humans have figured out: a way to communicate in this way,\u201d he says.",
      "It\u2019s part of why White\u2019s stamp means so much to him.",
      "\u201cThis is the only stamp I\u2019m going to use for the rest of my life,\u201c he says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m going to be so obnoxious with this.\u201d",
      "When asked what kind of message he\u2019d send with it, his answer is certain.",
      "\u201cShe was such a positive, funny, witty, bright light,\u201d he says. \u201cI think anything that you want to send with a kind of a positive, happy tone (her stamp) would totally be appropriate.\u201d"

      "Duke University has responded to the latest episode of \"The White Lotus,\" calling the inclusion of a Duke T-shirt on a character who is contemplating suicide and killing members of his own family \"troubling.\"",
      "Frank Tramble, vice president for communications, marketing and public affairs at Duke University, said in a March 27 statement to TODAY.com that the school did not \"approve the use of its marks\" in the hit HBO show.",
      "\u201cDuke appreciates artistic expression and creative storytelling, but characters prominently wearing apparel bearing Duke\u2019s federally registered trademarks creates confusion and mistakenly suggests an endorsement or affiliation where none exists,\" Tramble said.",
      "\u201c'The White Lotus' not only uses our brand without permission, but in our view uses it on imagery that is troubling, does not reflect our values or who we are, and simply goes too far,\" he continued.",
      "Tramble noted that suicide is the second-leading cause of death on college campuses.",
      "\"As imagery from the show is being shared widely across social media, we are using our brand to promote mental health awareness and remind people that help is available,\" Tramble said.",

      "And their youngest Ratliff son, Lochlan (Sam Nivola), is deciding between going to Duke and Chapel Hill while they're vacationing at the resort in Thailand.",
      "The reason the family went to Thailand was tied to Piper's studies at UNC as well. She told her family she needed to go to Thailand to complete her thesis at Chapel Hill, though it's later revealed that she actually wants to move to Thailand to study under a monk.",
      "While the family is vacationing, Tim learns he's under investigation for alleged financial crimes back at home \u2014 fueling his desperation on what to do in response."

      "People scaled mountains, rafted down rivers and trekked through forests in the hopes of discovering Fenn\u2019s secret box of riches, which was said to be worth up to $2 million. The legions of devoted treasure hunters were armed only with clues from a cryptic poem penned by Fenn, as well as other hints he scattered throughout his memoir and press interviews.",
      "Now, five years after the treasure was found, the mania around the quest is the subject of a new Netflix docuseries, \u201cGold & Greed: The Hunt for Fenn\u2019s Treasure.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the largest, biggest modern day treasure hunt of our time,\u201d director Jared McGilliard said in an interview Thursday with NBC News\u2019 Joe Fryer. \u201cIt harkens back to Indiana Jones \u2026 it just felt like a dream story to tell.\u201d",
      "The three-part series explores Forrest Fenn\u2019s motivations for hiding the treasure, and tells the stories of multiple people from all walks of life who sought the treasure for years.",
      "For many seekers, the quest for the treasure was rewarding in itself, McGilliard says.",
      "\u201cIt can be a little overused trope, but the journey is the adventure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt got people outside. It changed their perspective on themselves and their own life and what they can accomplish \u2026 People began to dream again, about how their life could change and on this amazing adventure.\u201d",

      "In 1988, Fenn, who was born in 1930, learned he had kidney cancer and was told he had a 20% chance of surviving three more years.",
      "Facing this diagnosis, he pondered how he would be remembered and what he wished to leave behind. Eventually, when thoughts about his mortality \u201chit bottom,\u201d Fenn was struck by an idea.",
      "\u201cIt had been so much fun building my collection over the decades, why not let others come searching for some of it while I\u2019m still here, and maybe continue looking for it after I\u2019m gone?\u201d he wrote in his 2010 memoir, \u201cThe Thrill of the Chase.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo I decided to fill a treasure chest with gold and jewels, then secret it \u2014 leaving clues on how to find it for any searcher willing to try,\u201d he continued.",
      "Fenn began filling an antique lock box with a heap of treasures he had accumulated over the years, including gold nuggets, two of which weighed more than a pound, and many other smaller gold pieces and coins, he revealed in his memoir.",
      "The box\u2019s treasures also included ancient Chinese carved jade figures, a Spanish 17th-century gold ring, and an antique gold bracelet set with 254 rubies, six emeralds, two Ceylon sapphires and several small diamonds.",
      "All told, the box contained about 20 troy pounds of gold and was estimated to be worth up to $2 million.",
      "Fenn spent years building the treasure box, and eventually hid it in the Rocky Mountains in around 2010, TODAY reported in 2013.",
      "As suggested by the title of his memoir, Fenn hid the box not only to enrich whoever found it, but to inspire treasure hunters to find intangible rewards in the search itself.",
      "\u201cGet your kids out in the countryside, take them fishing and get them away from their little hand-held machines,\u201d he told TODAY.",
      "In his memoir, he provided some clues as to the location of the treasure, noting it was \u201cin the mountains somewhere north of Santa Fe.\u201d He also said he hid the chest \u201cso it would be difficult to find but not impossible.\u201d",
      "Fenn also wrote a poem, included in his memoir, that he said contained nine clues about the location of the treasure. He noted that some subtle hints about the hidden loot were also scattered throughout his book.",
      "In addition to these clues, he appeared multiple times on TODAY in 2013 to reveal more hints about the location of the treasure. He shared that the treasure was not hidden in Idaho or Utah, nor was it hidden in a graveyard, hidden higher than 5,000 feet above sea level, or \u201cassociated with any structure.\u201d",
      "As interest grew in his hidden bounty, Fenn became an almost cult-like figure to thousands of fortune seekers, who combed through his writings and even used software to analyze his facial expressions in TV interviews to glean hints about the box\u2019s whereabouts, according to the documentary.",
      "Following his 1988 diagnosis, Fenn recovered from cancer. He died in Santa Fe of natural causes at 90 in 2020, the Associated Press reported. He was survived by his wife, Peggy, who died later that year, their two daughters, and multiple grandchildren.",
      "What did Forest Fenn's poem say?",
      "Fenn included a poem in his memoir that contained nine clues, which \"if followed precisely\u201d would lead to the location of his hidden treasure.",
      "\u201cThe clues are in consecutive order. If you want to find the treasure chest, you have my book,\u201d he told Lorena Mills in an interview on Report from Santa Fe in 2011.",
      "He said treasure seekers should begin by reading the book \u201cjust normally,\u201d and then go back and \u201cread the poem six, eight, 10 times, study every line, every word.\u201d",
      "Then, he recommended, \u201cread the book again slowly with the idea of looking for clues or hints that are in the book that will help you follow the clues (in the poem). You can find the chest with just the clues, but there are hints in the book that will help you with the clues.\u201d",
      "The poem reads as follows:",
      "As I have gone alone in there",
      "And with my treasures bold,",
      "I can keep my secret where,",
      "And hint of riches new and old.",
      "Begin it where warm waters halt",
      "And take it in the canyon down,",
      "Not far, but too far to walk.",
      "Put in below the home of Brown.",
      "From there it\u2019s no place for the meek,",
      "The end is drawing ever nigh;",
      "There\u2019ll be no paddle up your creek,",
      "Just heavy loads and water high.",
      "If you\u2019ve been wise and found the blaze,",
      "Look quickly down, your quest to cease,",
      "But tarry scant with marvel gaze,",
      "Just take the chest and go in peace.",
      "So why is it that I must go",
      "And leave my trove for all to seek?",
      "The answer I already know",
      "I\u2019ve done it tired, and now I\u2019m weak.",
      "So hear me all and listen good,",
      "Your effort will be worth the cold.",
      "If you are brave and in the wood",
      "I give you title to the gold.",
      "What happened during the hunt?",
      "Hundreds of thousands of treasure hunters around the world searched for Fenn\u2019s hidden box of riches, with some die-hard seekers devoting years of their lives to the quest.",
      "Fenn communicated regularly with fans, and once estimated he had received 13,000 emails and 18 marriage proposals from treasure seekers, according to journalist Ben Wallace, who wrote an in-depth feature about the quest for New York Magazine in 2020, and was interviewed in the documentary.",
      "The search \u201cgave them meaning in their lives and it led people to give up everything in pursuit of the treasure,\u201d Wallace said in the documentary. \u201cPeople were going through their savings to fund their searches, relationships ending, some people going to prison.\u201d",
      "A psychologist at the University of North Dakota even conducted a study on the Fenn treasure hunters in 2020 and found that 10% of seekers who blogged about their quests \u201cdescribed their involvement as a possible addiction.\u201d",
      "\u201cGold & Greed\u201d follows the stories of several devoted treasure hunters, including Cynthia Meacham, a retiree who trekked around the Rockies for years in search of the riches and developed a close personal relationship with Fenn.",
      "The documentary also chronicles the quest of Chris Hurst, a father who spent years hunting for the treasure in the Wyoming wilderness with his two sons in the hopes of giving his wife an easier retirement. The Hursts sold many of their assets and downsized their home to help fund their quest, Wyoming\u2019s Powell Tribune reported in 2020.",
      "For Justin Posey, another treasure seeker featured in the documentary, the hunt was \"less about the gold.\"",
      "\"It was about solving this puzzle that combined poetry and history and wilderness exploration,\" he told Joe Fryer on NBC News. \"It was just about deciphering the clues. And it almost became like a meditative experience.\"",
      "While Posey didn't find the treasure, he became linked to Fenn's legacy in another surprising way, as revealed in a major twist at the end of the docuseries.",
      "While Fenn\u2019s hidden treasure inspired wonder and an Indiana Jones-like sense of adventure in many searchers, the chase also had a dark side.",
      "At least five people died while seeking the treasure, including Randy Bilyeu, whose body was found near the Rio Grande river months after he went missing while searching for the loot in 2016, according to The Guardian. Another searcher, Paris Wallace, was also found dead along the Rio Grande the following year.",
      "Treasure hunter Jeff Murphy died after falling 500 feet in Yellowstone National Park in 2017, and searcher Eric Ashby drowned while rafting the Arkansas River in Colorado.",
      "A fifth treasure seeker, Michael Wayne Sexson, also died in 2017 after trekking into Dinosaur National Monument along the Utah-Colorado border without adequate clothing or food, according to the Denver Post.",
      "As the potential dangers of the quest became more apparent, Pete Kassetas, the former New Mexico State Police Chief, publicly implored Fenn to call off the search.",
      "\u201cI did not know how to stop this. I wanted to quit sending in people to save the searchers,\u201d Kassetas said in the documentary.",
      "In 2017, Fenn said in a statement that he would not encourage people to stop seeking the treasure.",
      "\u201cI have given a lot of thought about ending the search, but I am not sure what that would accomplish,\u201d the statement read, as shown in the documentary.",
      "Who found Forrest Fenn's treasure?",
      "The search for Fenn\u2019s treasure ended a decade after it began when it was confirmed that Jack Stuef, a then-32-year-old medical student, had found the antique box in Wyoming on June 6, 2020.",
      "\u201cThis treasure hunt was the most frustrating experience of my life,\u201d Stuef wrote in a Medium essay that year. \u201cThere were a few times when I, exhausted, covered in scratches and bites and sweat and pine pitch, and nearing the end of my day\u2019s water supply, sat down on a downed tree and just cried alone in the woods in sheer frustration.\u201d",
      "He did not disclose the exact location of the treasure, although other seekers later used photos to zoom in on the exact place the box had likely been discovered, as shown in the documentary.",
      "Stuef, who described himself as a \u201cmillennial with student loans to pay off,\u201d sold the majority of Fenn\u2019s treasure at auction in 2022.",
      "The final auction brought in about $1.3 million and included more than 400 items, including gold coins and nuggets, gold dust, and precious jewelry, as well as a glass jar holding a scroll apparently printed with a 20,000-word autobiography of Fenn, according to Heritage Auctions.",
      "Stuef said he had initially hoped to maintain his anonymity, and said Fenn had been fully supportive of protecting his identity.",
      "\u201cNot because I have anything to hide, but because Forrest and his family endured stalkers, death threats, home invasions, frivolous lawsuits, and a potential kidnapping \u2014 all at the hands of people with delusions related to his treasure,\u201d Stuef wrote in a later Medium essay. \u201cI don\u2019t want those things to happen to me and my family.\u201d",
      "However, Stuef ended up revealing his identity in December 2020 after he learned about what he described as a \u201cmeritless lawsuit\u201d was going to be brought against him by a woman he didn\u2019t know.",
      "\u201cThis would make my name a matter of public record, so I chose to come forward today,\u201d he wrote on Medium.",
      "He called the lawsuit an \u201cabuse of the court system\u201d and maintained he was \u201cthe legitimate finder of the treasure.\u201d",
      "Stuef says he was \u201cthankful\u201d to meet Fenn once before he died, and honored the collector and author\u2019s legacy in an essay after he died in 2020.",
      "\u201cOf course, Forrest\u2019s greatest gift to humanity was his treasure,\u201d Stuef wrote. \u201cSure, it could only be given to one person, the one who found it, but it inspired hope the world over and the joy of discovery for all those who got to go out and appreciate the wonders of the Rockies.\u201d"

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance is set to land in Greenland to a chorus of anger and anxiety at White House plans to seize the Arctic territory by any means necessary.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance sharply criticized Denmark and other European allies during his visit to Greenland on Friday, as the Trump administration continues to push U.S. ownership of the semi-autonomous territory.",
      "Speaking to servicemembers at Pituffik Space Base, a U.S. Space Force base on the northwestern coast of Greenland, Vance argued that Greenlanders would be better off being under the protection of the U.S. than under Denmark.",
      "\u201cOur message to Denmark is very simple \u2014 you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,\" Vance said. \"You have under-invested in the people of Greenland and you have under-invested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful land mass.\"",
      "Days after President Donald Trump said that the U.S. \u201cwould\u00a0go as far as we have to\u201d to take ownership of territory, Vance made a pitch to the people of Greenland: \"I think that you\u2019d be a lot better coming under the United States security umbrella than you have been under Denmark's security umbrella.\"",
      "Asked if the Trump administration had plans to expand the U.S. military's presence in Greenland, Vance said there aren't, but said they do plan to invest more resources such as ice breakers and additional naval ships in the area. He argues it's part of an effort to put an end to ignoring encroachment from other countries, which he said the U.S. has done for the last 40 years.",
      "\"We can\u2019t just bury our head in the sand \u2014\u00a0or in Greenland, bury our head in the snow \u2014 and pretend that the Chinese are not interested in this very large land mass. We know that they are,\" he said. Vance was asked by reporters several times whether the U.S. would ever use military force to acquire Greenland and he said he doesn't think that will ever be necessary. The vice president said he envisions that Greenlanders will become independent from Denmark and then he said the U.S. will discuss their future with them.",
      "Vance is traveling with his wife, second lady Usha Vance, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and national security adviser Michael Waltz.",
      "After landing in Greenland on Air Force Two, the vice president and his wife were greeted by personnel at the Space Force base.",
      "\"It's cold as s--- here! Nobody told me!\" Vance said in a mess hall on the base as he sat down to eat with servicemembers. Weather websites showed single-digit subzero temperatures at the time.",
      "Vance said he's the first vice president to visit Greenland and remarked he had had a \"beautiful flight.\" The vice president said he and his team would speak to officials on base to understand how their work contributes to U.S. national security \u2014 which has been President Donald Trump's stated reasons for his interest in the U.S. taking control of the Danish territory.",
      "\"We\u2019re gonna get a briefing, of course, about, you know, what you guys do every day, and then we\u2019re gonna talk just about, as you\u2019ve heard, we have some interest in Greenland from the Trump administration,\" Vance said. He added that the administration and the president specifically were interested in \"Arctic security.\"",
      "Trump reiterated his desire to acquire Greenland while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday. \"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security. We have to have Greenland. It\u2019s not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can\u2019t.\"",
      "Hours before Vance and his wife took off from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday night that he had no problem with Trump's proposed land grab of the world's largest island.",
      "Trump\u2019s desire to take Greenland has \u201clong historical roots,\u201d Putin said Thursday at Russia\u2019s Arctic Forum in Murmansk, the largest city north of the Arctic Circle. \u201cThis is an issue that concerns two specific nations and has nothing to do with us.\u201d",
      "Trump has for years stated his desire to take over the territory, two-thirds of which sits above the Arctic Circle, and whose melting ice hides a bonanza of rare-earth elements, oil and natural gas.Denmark fully controlled the island for 300 years until it became a semi-autonomous territory in 1953. Although Greenland gained home rule in 1979, Copenhagen still controls its foreign and defense policy and contributes just under $1 billion to its economy.",
      "It is a vast, sparse land \u2014 around the size of Alaska and California combined but with only 56,000 people.",
      "NBC News traveled there this week ahead of Vance's visit and locals said they felt betrayed by their giant North American neighbor.",
      "Patrick Abrahamsen, 45, a search-and-rescue hoist operator for Air Greenland, told NBC News that his opinion of his country\u2019s relationship with America has changed since Trump took office.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been said some stuff from the administration of Trump, and some of that hasn\u2019t been that polite, I would say,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way that they\u2019ve just invited themselves, for example, and the way that they\u2019ve spoken about Greenland has changed the sentiment up here about how Americans are portrayed and how we look at them.\u201d",
      "Abrahamsen added that he used to view the U.S.-Greenland relationship as \u201calways close,\u201d but said, \u201cNow, it\u2019s a different story.\u201d",
      "Anders Laursen, 41, owner of a local water taxi company, had a similar take.",
      "\u201cWe have always looked at America like the nice big brother to help you out and now it\u2019s like the big brother is bullying you,\u201d Laursen said.",
      "That anger saw the U.S. delegation's visit vastly downscaled, albeit with the addition of the vice president. Originally intended to encompass a visit to the capital, Nuuk, and with cultural elements such as a dog-sled race, it will now only last one day and be confined to U.S. Pituffik Space Base, which is hundreds of miles from the capital \u2014 and likely any dissenting locals.",
      "One person not raising objections is Putin.",
      "He used his speech in Murmansk to detail past U.S. attempts to annex Greenland dating to the 1860s. The Russian leader has often used his own reading of Ukrainian history \u2014 which experts say is replete with ahistorical inaccuracies \u2014 to justify his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "On the eve of the visit, Greenland's political parties banded together to form a coalition government following elections there last month, according to local media reports.Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of Demokraatit, the largest party in the legislature, had urged his rivals to put aside their domestic differences and form the broadest possible coalition to resist the prospect of a hostile Trump takeover.",
      "That appears to have come to pass, with four of the five parties in the legislature involved in the new coalition, local media reported.",
      "During the Greenlandic election, Nielsen, the eventual winner, told\u00a0NBC News international partner Sky News that \u201cwe don\u2019t want to be Americans. No, we don\u2019t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders.\u201d"

      "On Tuesday, Ballal \u2014 his face bruised and clothes still spotted with blood \u2014 recounted to The Associated Press how he was heavily beaten by an Israeli settler and soldiers the night before. The settler, he said, kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during a settler attack on his village.",
      "The soldiers then detained him and two other Palestinians. Ballal said he was kept blindfolded for more than 20 hours, sitting on the floor under a blasting air conditioner. The soldiers kicked, punched or hit him with a stick whenever they came on their guard shifts, he said. Ballal doesn\u2019t speak Hebrew, but he said he heard them saying his name and the word \u201cOscar.\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d he said in an interview at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to the claims that Ballal was beaten by soldiers. The settler whom Ballal identified as his attacker, Shem Tov Luski \u2014 who has threatened Ballal in the past \u2014 denied he or the soldiers beat him and told the AP that he and other Palestinians in the village had thrown stones at his car. He said he didn\u2019t know Ballal was an Oscar winner.",
      "The Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks as well as one Israeli civilian, who was soon released. Ballal denied throwing stones.",
      "\u2018I\u2019m dying\u2019",
      "The attack took place Monday night in the southern West Bank village of Susiya. It\u2019s part of the Masafer Yatta region featured in \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which depicts the Palestinian residents\u2019 attempts to fend off settler attacks and the military\u2019s plans to demolish their homes.",
      "At around sunset, as residents were ending their daylong Ramadan fast, roughly two dozen Jewish settlers along with police entered the village, throwing stones at houses and breaking property, witnesses say. Around 30 soldiers arrived soon after. Jewish Israelis in an activist group supporting the villagers showed video of themselves also being attacked, with settlers hitting their car with sticks and stones.",
      "Ballal said he filmed some of the damage caused by the settlers. Then he went to his own home and locked it, with his wife and three young children inside.",
      "\u201cI told myself if they will attack me, if they kill me, I will protect my family,\u201d he said.",
      "Ballal said Luski approached with two soldiers. He said Luski hit him on the head, knocked him to the ground and kept kicking and punching him in the head. At the same time, one soldier hit him on the legs with his gun butt, while the other pointed his weapon at him, he said.",
      "Lamia Ballal, the director\u2019s wife, said she was huddling inside with their children and heard him screaming, \u201cI\u2019m dying!\u201d",
      "Luski told the AP that he and other settlers had come to the village to help a fellow settler who said he was being attacked by Palestinian stone-throwers. He said dozens of masked Palestinians attacked his car with stones, including Ballal. \u201cHe broke my window, threw a stone at my chest,\u201d he said.",
      "He said when soldiers arrived, he led them to Ballal\u2019s house to identify him as one of the attackers but denied that he hit him or that settlers attacked any property in the village. Luski said he had footage of the night\u2019s events but when asked to show it to the AP, he responded with a string of expletives.",
      "On Tuesday, a small bloodstain could be seen outside Ballal\u2019s home, and the family car\u2019s windows were shattered. Neighbors pointed to a nearby water tank with a hole in the side that they said had been punched by the settlers.",
      "Under detention",
      "Lea Tsemel, the attorney representing Ballal and the two other Palestinians detained with him, said they were taken to an army base, where they only received minimal care for their injuries from the attack. She said they had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.",
      "Ballal said he had no idea where he was being held, could see nothing and was \u201cfreezing\u201d from the hours spent blindfolded under the air conditioner.",
      "The three were transferred to an Israeli police station at the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba and were released Tuesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cAll my body is pain,\u201d he told the AP immediately after his release as he walked, limping, toward a hospital in the nearby Palestinian city of Hebron.",
      "Doctors at the hospital said Ballal had bruises and scratches all over his body, abrasions under his eye and a cut on his chin but no internal injuries. The two other detained Palestinians also had minor injuries.",
      "Confrontations with settlers",
      "In a widely circulated video from August, Luski and several other masked settlers are seen arguing with Ballal. Luski shouts profanity at him and tries to provoke him into a fight.",
      "\u201cThis is my land, I was given it by God,\u201d Luski says. \u201cNext time it won\u2019t be nice.\u201d He taunts Ballal with the prospect of being sent to\u00a0Sde Teiman, a notorious military prison holding Palestinians detained from Gaza, where five soldiers have been charged with raping a detainee with a knife.",
      "\u201cRape for a higher cause,\u201d he says in Hebrew, then blows Ballal a kiss.",
      "The film \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a\u00a0joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "Settlers have also set up outposts around the area and at times destroy Palestinian property. Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces usually\u00a0turn a blind eye\u00a0or intervene on behalf of the settlers.",
      "The film has drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed\u00a0ending the lease\u00a0of a movie theater that screened it.",
      "Basel Adra, another of the film\u2019s co-directors and a prominent Palestinian activist in the area, said there\u2019s been a massive upswing in attacks by settlers and Israeli forces since the Oscar win.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in dark days here, in Gaza, and all of the West Bank,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s stopping this.\u201d",
      "Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal.",
      "The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out widescale military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and\u00a0displaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis."

      "While the challenge is yet to be accepted, it\u2019s an\u00a0idea with deep\u00a0 roots in the Soviet era, when hockey became a proxy arena in which to address geopolitical tensions. Most notably for Americans, the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d saw a largely amateur American team defeat the mighty Soviet \u201cRed Machine.\u201d",
      "But rather than seeking \u201cwar by other means\u201d \u2014 as the sport is often known \u2014 Russia\u2019s hockey fanatic leader likely wants to use the rink as a way to end his country\u2019s pariah status, both in terms of politics and sports, experts say.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s overarching goal is to break out of diplomatic isolation,\u201d said Gary Smith, a former Canadian diplomat posted to Moscow who understands hockey diplomacy better than most.",
      "As a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada.",
      "\u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him,\u201d added Smith, who recounted his tale in the book \"Ice War Diplomat: Hockey meets Cold War Politics at the 1972 Summit Series.\"",
      "These overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term.",
      "Until now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.",
      "In the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.",
      "Asked about this Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d",
      "Throughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cpingpong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.",
      "\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d",
      "Putin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming, author of the book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "It\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "One governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",

      "\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism about whether the games will actually ever play out.",

      "Some 73% of victims killed by law enforcement were reportedly gang members, but 27% \u201cwere not associated with gangs and were often struck by stray bullets while in the streets or at home,\u201d the report said. It noted that in some cases, police opened fire from armored vehicles \u201cwhere people were walking or selling goods on the streets.\u201d",
      "It also said police have been reportedly involved in summary executions of suspected gang members, their families, \u201cor individuals who, when intercepted, were unable to provide identification or offer a sufficient explanation for their presence in the area.\u201d",
      "The report stated that nearly 1,000 firearms belonging to Haiti\u2019s National Police have been diverted in the past four years, and that credible sources have said officers are selling some weapons on the black market.",
      "A police spokesperson did not immediately return a message requesting comment.",
      "The report said gangs also obtain illegal weapons from private security companies that use them.",
      "Overall, an estimated 270,000 to 500,000 illegal weapons are circulating across Haiti.",
      "\u201cThe use of these firearms has fueled a destructive cycle of violence in Haiti, leading to severe human rights abuses,\u201d the report stated.",
      "Detecting and seizing illegal weapons remains a challenge given what the report said was severe underfunding and understaffing at Haiti\u2019s customs and police departments, as well as a lack of resources and technology coupled with corruption and lack of oversight.",
      "It noted that a U.N.-backed mission led\u00a0by Kenyan police to help fight gangs in Haiti\u00a0has only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel envisioned.",
      "One Kenyan officer, Samuel Tompoi Kaetuai,\u00a0was killed in February\u00a0in Haiti\u2019s central Artibonite region. A second officer, identified by Haiti\u2019s government as Benedict Kabiru, is considered dead\u00a0after he went missing\u00a0when gangs attacked his group on Monday as they tried to rescue Haitian police stuck in a ditch that officials believe was dug on purpose by gunmen."

      "Speaking to reporters during a visit to a Russian nuclear submarine in Murmansk, the largest city north of the Arctic Circle, Putin reiterated his claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's mandate is illegitimate.",
      "With the United Nations, the United States and European nations, \"we could discuss the possibility of introduction of temporary governance in Ukraine,\u201d Putin said, while Ukraine holds \u201cdemocratic elections, to bring to power a capable government that enjoys the trust of the people.\u201d",

      "While Zelenskyy's term expired last year, Ukrainian Constitution states that elections cannot be held during wartime. Still, Putin, who has ruled Russia for all but four of the past 25 years via elections widely considered illegitimate, has repeatedly questioned Zelenskyy's mandate.",
      "A recent poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that 69% of Ukrainians trust Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership.",

      "His comments follow attempts by U.S. officials to re-establish relations with Moscow and broker a 30-day ceasefire with Kyiv that Moscow has rebuffed amid accusations from European leaders that Putin is stalling without any serious intent to pause fighting.",
      "With an American delegation negotiating separately with Russian and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia, the White House said Tuesday that it had reached an agreement with both parties for a truce over the Black Sea, a strategic body of water bordering Ukraine, Russia and four other countries, including Turkey, a major U.S. ally and NATO member.",
      "Ukrainian officials had yet to respond to Putin's suggestion on its governance, although Zelenskyy has repeatedly accused the Kremlin of setting terms that amount to a surrender by Kyiv.",
      "While the Russian news agency Tass said Thursday that another round of Russian-American talks on Ukraine may take place in Riyadh in mid-April, Zelenskyy cast doubt over the integrity of future peace talks this week, suggesting in an interview with Time magazine that Russia had unduly influenced U.S. officials on the negotiating team.",
      "Zelenskyy on Wednesday also accused the Trump administration of \"constantly changing\" the terms of a minerals deal it is negotiating with Ukraine, which would see the U.S. get a 50% stake in Ukraine's mineral wealth and oil and gas reserves in exchange for military aid.",

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 European far-right leaders were in Jerusalem on Thursday for a conference organized by the Israeli government aimed at combating antisemitism, which was shunned by mainstream Jewish leaders because of the divisive guest list.",
      "The event illustrates a growing alliance between Israel \u2014 a country founded on the ashes of the Holocaust \u2014 and a European far-right that some critics say has not shed its links to\u00a0antisemitism\u00a0and Naziism during World War II.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads an ultranationalist government, has cultivated close ties in recent years with far-right populist leaders in countries like Hungary, Brazil and Argentina. Many of these leaders, including Netanyahu, have been greatly influenced by the policies and demeanor of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "In a speech to the conference, Netanyahu commended Trump for his \u201cdecisive actions against antisemitism\u201d and blamed U.S. campus protests against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza on \u201ca systemic alliance between ultra-progressive left and radical Islam.\u201d",
      "\u201cAntisemitism is a disease carried by barbarians\u201d in \u201call civilized societies,\u201d said Netanyahu.",
      "Thursday\u2019s conference illuminated the increasingly strained relationship between Israel and its traditional allies in the West, which have grown uneasy with Israeli politics and the direction of the country\u2019s devastating\u00a0war in Gaza. Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas and resumed the war earlier this month, and Netanyahu is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity in Gaza.",
      "Jewish communities around the world have reported increases in antisemitic violence since the start of the war.",
      "Also attending the event was Bosnian Serb President\u00a0Milorad Dodik, even after a Bosnian court requested an international\u00a0arrest warrant\u00a0for him for his\u00a0separatist policies.",
      "During the conference, Dodik spoke out defiantly against the warrant.",
      "\u201cThe Muslims from Sarajevo they want to punish me because I came here to Israel supporting Israel,\u201d Dodik told The Associated Press through a translator. \u201cThey are misusing the judiciary and the prosecutor office because they are in charge for that.\u201d",
      "Most speakers at the conference railed against antisemitism on the political left and in Muslim societies, with only brief mention of antisemitism on the right. Panels of speakers were set to focus on \u201cHow Progressivism Fell Captive to Antisemitism\u201d and \u201cHow Radical Islam Fuels Antisemitism in the West.\u201d",
      "Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right French National Rally party, gave a keynote address in which he blamed rising antisemitism in Europe on migration and Islamism.",
      "\u201cIslamism is the totalitarianism of the 21st century. It threatens to destroy everything that is not like it,\u201d he said.",
      "David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel during Trump\u2019s first term, also attended. Asked by the moderator about Trump\u2019s plan to\u00a0remove Palestinians\u00a0from Gaza, Friedman said: \u201cI love it! I love it. And I think it\u2019s doable.\u201d",
      "Other far-right Europeans are attending from the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Hungary.",
      "The European far-right\u2019s anti-immigrant platform has focused heavily on immigration from Muslim countries, finding common ground in what Israel describes as a shared battle against Islamic extremism. Critics say this alliance often veers into Islamophobia.",
      "Many mainstream Jewish leaders dropped out of the event after initially agreeing to attend, including Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, a leading U.S. nonprofit that battles antisemitism.",
      "French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, German antisemitism czar Felix Klein and German politician Volker Beck also canceled their participation, while Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog, also pulled out of the conference in favor of hosting a separate meeting of Jewish leaders who had originally come to the country for the conference, his office said."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Rain and cooler temperatures helped South Korean fire crews as they battled the country\u2019s worst-ever wildfires on Friday, as the governor of the hardest-hit region called for overhauling the response to the climate crisis that he says worsened the disaster.",
      "The wildfires, which have killed 28 people and razed vast swaths of land in the southeast in the last week, were 85% contained as of Friday morning, Korea Forest Service chief Lim Sang-seop told a televised briefing. He said authorities would launch \u201call-out efforts\u201d to extinguish the remaining blazes by bringing more helicopters and firefighters to the areas.",
      "The raging inferno has also destroyed thousands of houses, factories, vehicles and other structures, while mountains and hills were stripped of anything but a carpet of smoldering ashes.",
      "\u201cHazes have been diminished because of the rain last night, so that\u2019s favorable for securing visibility. Also temperatures are now lower than the last few days, so things are very favorable to put out the wildfires,\u201d Lim said.",
      "Firefighters \u2014 many in their 60s, a reflection of one of the world\u2019s fastest-aging populations \u2014 navigated forests in yellow helmets and red protective suits, spraying suppressants at flames that flickered near their feet. Helicopters dropped buckets of water over hills that glowed red in the night.",
      "Residents hunkered down in temporary shelters in places like schools and gyms, but the fire crept dangerously close to some of them too. A video shared by one evacuee shows blazes approaching a school soccer field under a sky choked with smoke.",
      "\u201cI just kept crying this morning,\u201d said 79-year-old Seo Jae Tak, an evacuee at a gym in Andong city, on Thursday. \u201cWhen I went back yesterday, the entire mountain had turned to ashes. It\u2019s just unbelievable, I can\u2019t even put it into words. All I can do is cry.\u201d",
      "Authorities were mobilizing about 9,000 people, 125 helicopters and hundreds of other vehicles to battle the wildfires, the government\u2019s disaster response center said.",
      "The wildfires have burned 118,265 acres of land, forced more than 30,000 people to flee their homes and injured 37 others since last Friday. Officials said Friday that 8,000 residents remained at temporary shelters. The fires have been driven by strong winds and dry weather.",
      "While it is difficult to link any one event to climate change, officials and experts say that it is making wildfires more likely and more severe. Scientists have already warned that the warming atmosphere around the world is driving ever more extreme weather events, including wildfires, flooding, droughts, hurricanes and heat waves that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "\u201cWe must completely overhaul our wildfire response strategy in the face of extreme climate conditions,\u201d Lee Cheol-woo, governor of North Gyeongsang Province, said at a news conference.",
      "Lee noted that the past week has shown how wildfires, fueled by dry and windy conditions, can quickly overwhelm the country\u2019s resources. He said he would request that the government establish better evacuation guidelines, adopt more powerful firefighting tools including aircraft equipped with water cannons, and adopt other approaches to improve firefighting efforts during nighttime hours.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the equipment for firefighting at night,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIn the night, firefighting is done solely with manual efforts, but with the increased density of our forests compared to the past, it\u2019s difficult to manage with just that.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Lee Han-kyung, deputy head of the disaster response center, told a meeting that the wildfires showed \u201cthe reality of climate crisis that we have yet experienced,\u201d according to the Yonhap news agency.",
      "The people killed were mostly in their 60s or older. They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a fire Wednesday and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames. Officials say older people found it difficult to evacuate quickly but have not provided details of the civilian dead.",
      "In Uiseong, about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, which is said to have been originally built in the 7th century, have burned. Among them were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\u201d: a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king."

      "Around 4,000 of them are \u201cbelieved to have been killed or injured,\u201d it said.",
      "Seoul\u2019s update came as Russia\u2019s security council chief Sergei Shoigu met with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang last week, where he forwarded a message from Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Russian state news agency TASS, Shoigu said they discussed security issues \u201cin different regions and on the Korean Peninsula in particular.\u201d",
      "Cooperation with North Korea continued even as Moscow and Kyiv agreed on a limited and temporary ceasefire, as the White House made shaky attempts in Saudi Arabia this week to broker a long-term deal. Both sides have already accused each other of violating the agreed-upon deal, which prohibits targeting energy infrastructure.",
      "The Ukraine military on Thursday said it shot down 42 drones launched by Russia toward various regions, including in the southern regions around Russian-annexed Crimea.",
      "It did not say if the drones targeted energy infrastructure.",
      "Separately, the Ukrainian emergency service said that at least 12 people were injured from a drone strike in Kharkiv on Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, European allies are expected to meet in Paris on Thursday to discuss aid for Ukraine and long-term peace, as U.S. support for Ukraine recedes under President Donald Trump.",
      "Beyond troops, Pyongyang has also continued to provide Moscow with munitions, Seoul has said. \u201cTo date, it is estimated that North Korea has supplied a substantial quantity of [short-range ballistic missiles], 170mm self-propelled guns, and about 220 240mm multiple rocket launchers,\u201d the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in the assessment.",
      "The volume of those weapons is also \u201cexpected to increase depending on battlefield developments,\u201d it added.",
      "North Korea\u2019s troops, widely considered disciplined and trained, nevertheless lack battlefield experience, which experts say is why they have suffered relatively high casualties from drone and artillery attacks.",
      "Still, Pyongyang\u2019s contribution is a further sign of deepening ties with the Kremlin, with which it signed a mutual defense treaty last year, elevating their status to that of formal allies. North Korea has receievd technical assistance from Russia for its satellite program, according to Seoul.",
      "U.S. officials and others say that North Korea may also be receiving support for its growing nuclear ambitions in return for its military support.",
      "It\u2019s against this backdrop that Kim is considering a visit to Moscow, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to Pyongyang.",
      "\u201cThe plans are big,\u201d Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko was quoted as saying Thursday by the Russian news agency Interfax, reflected in the high-level delegation Russia is considering sending to North Korea. \u201cWe will implement them.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "It can be hard to describe that feeling of being overcome by the unbearable cuteness of a fluffy little cat or a chubby-cheeked baby. But there\u2019s now an official word for it in English: gigil.",
      "Borrowed from Tagalog, one of the primary languages of the Philippines, gigil is among 42 words that are untranslatable or have no direct English equivalents that have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) in March.",
      "Gigil (pronounced \u201cghee-gill\u201d), which the OED says dates to 1990 and is also used in Philippine English, refers to a feeling \u201cso intense that it gives us the irresistible urge to tightly clench our hands, grit our teeth, and pinch or squeeze whomever or whatever it is\u202fwe find so adorable,\u201d according to the OED\u2019s latest update.",
      "It can be used both as a noun identifying the feeling itself as well as an adjective for a person experiencing that feeling, as in \u201cI\u2019m so gigil.\u201d",
      "The newest dictionary additions include loanwords from Southeast Asia, South Africa and Ireland.",
      "The lexical gap, where untranslatable words are found in one language but not others, can be easily filled by simply borrowing these words, OED\u00a0executive editor Danica Salazar wrote in the update.",
      "For example, komorebi is a Japanese word to describe sunlight dappling through leaves, while the Norwegian term utepils means sitting outside enjoying a beer, both of which have no English equivalents but are gaining popularity.",
      "Sometimes, people who speak English alongside other languages use loanwords with \u201cenough frequency\u201d that they eventually become part of the vocabulary of their variety of English, Salazar said.",
      "Aside from gigil, the list includes 10 other loanwords from the Philippines, such as videoke, the Filipino version of karaoke, and terror, a strict, harsh or demanding teacher.Twelve of the new words come from the Philippines\u2019 Southeast Asian neighbors Malaysia and Singapore. Nearly half of them refer to food such as otak-otak, a dish consisting of seafood mixed with spices and coconut milk, and ketupat, a small rice cake boiled in a pouch of woven palm leaves.",
      "The region\u2019s colloquial exclamation alamak, which is used to convey surprise and dismay, is also included in the list, though its exact origin is uncertain.",
      "Of the 11 words borrowed from South Africa, two are expressions that relate to feelings of frustration and anger \u2014 gatvol, a slang term describing a person who feels extremely annoyed, and the hell-in, a colloquial phrase used predicatively to talk about a furious individual.",
      "Irish contributes eight loanwords to the OED update. They include debs, a formal social event for students, and class, a general term of approval that appears in the popular Northern Ireland sitcom \u201cDerry Girls.\u201d",
      "With around 500,000 words and 150 years of history, the OED is widely regarded as the accepted authority on the English language.",
      "OED editors review thousands of word suggestions every year to determine which words to include in updates. The dictionary has a watch list database with contributions from various sources, such as its own reading programs, crowdsourcing appeals, and automated monitoring and analysis of language in use."
